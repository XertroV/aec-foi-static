AEC TPs - Phishing attempt against the AEC and the EIAT.docx

In response to Kath’s suggestion for discourse on the below topics in the Voice meeting tomorrow, please see some 
high-level talking points for your review and clearance to Matt attached (the EIAT section of the original talking 
points is what has been updated). 

After Matt has approved, think it’ll be worth sharing with Kath/others for visibility. 

Happy to discuss. 

Kind regards

Wonderful, thanks 

I will share the general response with NIAA but given the mis/dis meeting has been set up now for Friday it will make 
most sense for Matt to provide this context in that session.  

And on the topic of Friday’s meeting, I have forwarded another invitation that has come from NIAA. @Matthew – pls 
invite anyone from your team you want there (EES, perhaps?).  

- 
- 

I intend to open given I kind of instigated this joining up (unless 
I will perhaps throw to Matt for some info on: 

 does) 

o  Briefly what EIAT is and what was done in mis/dis space for 22FE 
o  What we intend to do for 23Ref 
o  What we won’t do (I’m happy to speak to this if needed. But it is basically anything not relating to 

process of the referendum, e.g. operation of The Voice etc.) 

- 

I understand there will be reps from AGD, DoF, Infra & Comms 

 and Home Affairs 

 NIAA.

Hi Kath 

Please see the attached talking points, now cleared by AC EICB Matt Haigh, regarding the below email thread and 
request for information from the NIAA in December. 

For quick reference, the NIAA has asked for: 

- 

Clarity re the purpose of the [spear phishing] attack, trends, and what the overall risks are. Also would be 
good to understand what the EIAT is and whether a referendum specific one is needed. 

This topic may be raised during the VOICE Mis/Disinformation meeting with the NIAA (and others) on Friday 13 
January 2022. If that is the case, Matt is attending and is comfortable talking to the subject given the EICB equites as 
well as his role as Chair of the Electoral Integrity Assurance Taskforce if you would like. 

In response to NIAA’s queries at a high-level: 

- 

- 

Information about the EIAT is within the talking points, including the EIAT Board’s intention to brief the NIAA 
/ Referendum IDC about the EIAT and its potential role during the proposed referendum – likely to occur soon 
or at least within qtr. 1 2023 (to be scheduled by PM&C). 

Please let me know if you have any questions. 

Kind regards 
Anna 

 | Assistant Director

Good afternoon EIAT members 

For your information and awareness, we would like to bring to your attention a recent ‘spear phishing’ email 
campaign at the AEC.  The detail of these emails is below.   

AEC systems were not compromised in any way. We believe this is worthwhile sharing with the EIAT on the basis 
that despite being contained by the AEC, the campaign appears targeted and somewhat sophisticated.  It is possible 
it relates to the proposed referendum given the targeting of AEC’s Indigenous Electoral Participation Program 
mailboxes.  

It is a reminder that the cyber threat environment for the proposed referendum is unlikely to be lower than for a 
federal election. 

Email details 
On 14 November 2022, at 22:52, a series of emails were sent to the AEC’s eight IEPP mailboxes, from the falsified 
email address support[@]aec.gov.au, with the subject ‘[email address] have 12 Pending incoming emails’. The list of 
recipients is as follows: 

• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 

indigenous@aec.gov.au 
indigenous-sa@aec.gov.au 
indigenous-wa@aec.gov.au 
indigenous-vic@aec.gov.au 
indigenous-tas@aec.gov.au 
indigenous-qld@aec.gov.au
