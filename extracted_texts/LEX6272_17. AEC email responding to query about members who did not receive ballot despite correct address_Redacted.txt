Hi 
The information regarding the PFA SA election was advertised via AEC and the
Organisation. The members who did not receive the voting pack could have contacted AEC
to ask for issuance of another set of voting pack. The ballot period is now closed, and the
results have been declared.

Good morning,
Thankyou for the quick reply.
I was wondering if you also know how AEC obtained the list of addresses to
send our voting papers to? Was it a list supplied by PASA or the address
members’ have registered with AEC? I am a PASA workplace delegate and
have numerous members who didn’t receive their voting papers.
Thankyou
