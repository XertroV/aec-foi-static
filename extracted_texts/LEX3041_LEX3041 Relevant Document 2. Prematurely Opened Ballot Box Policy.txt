Purpose of policy 

The purpose of this policy is to ensure that instances where a ballot box is opened 
prematurely are managed, reported, and conducted in accordance with the provisions of the 
Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 (Electoral Act) and in the case of a referendum, the 
Referendum (Machinery Provisions) Act 1984 (Referendum Act). 

This policy is not applicable for overseas pre-poll voting centres – all overseas voting is covered in relevant 
procedural documents established specifically for overseas voting services.  

1.  Legislative background 

1.1  Section 238B of the Electoral Act and s 41AB of the Referendum Act outline the process that the AEC 

and its officers are to undertake when a ballot box is opened prematurely. 

2.  Prematurely opened ballot box 

2.1  A prematurely opened ballot box includes any ballot box: 

• 

containing either ordinary ballot papers or declaration vote envelopes, that has been opened before 
the relevant legislated time frame1 

•  discovered to have been opened before the legislated time frame 2  

•  where the seal numbers do not match the numbers recorded on the Record of security seals form, 

and the discrepancy cannot be explained. 

2.2 

It excludes ballot boxes where a seal was not affixed correctly in the first place and/or the seal has been 
accidentally damaged and requires replacement. These types of instances are to be dealt with as part of 
normal operations.

3.  Investigation process 

3.1  The premature opening of a ballot box (including declaration vote ballot boxes) or the discovery of a 

prematurely opened ballot box triggers the requirement to undertake: 

•  an investigation into and recording of the details of the premature opening of the ballot box 

•  an examination of the ballot papers or declaration vote envelopes in the prematurely opened ballot 

box to enable the Australian Electoral Officer (AEO) for the state or territory concerned to determine 
if they are to be included or excluded from scrutiny. 

3.2  The identification of prematurely opened ballot boxes and actions to be taken are the same for federal 

elections and referendums, or where the two events are held concurrently.  

3.3  The Prematurely Opened Ballot Box SOP details the correct process to undertake an investigation and 
the subsequent actions. These procedures must be followed where an officer suspects there is a 
prematurely opened ballot box.  

4.  Scenario guide 

4.1  Certain scenarios may be breaches of the Ballot Paper Handling Policy, but are not considered a 
prematurely opened ballot box. These should be dealt with as part of normal operations.
