TikTok maintains a data retention policy that determines data retention periods for different categories of user data. 
TikTok’s threshold for disclosing information is determined on a case by case basis in accordance with applicable 
laws. 

  Additional information on reporting channels and incident handling 

Overall, we aim to review reported content within 24hrs (in alignment with requirements in the Online Safety Act 
2021). As the AEC would recall in the 2022 Australian Federal Election, this response time may be much faster, even 
within a few hours, depending on the type of content reported or flagged.  
We will await the AEC's letter regarding updated referendum regulations! 
Kind regards

Hi 

Just a quick note to thank you for your time in our recent meeting and apologies for the delay in following up.  

To recap, the AEC will be providing all platforms with a letter outlining the regulatory environment once legislation 
is finalised. Following this, we’d be very happy to schedule a meeting and discuss any question you may have. Of 
course, if we can offer any assistance in the interim please let me know.  

Additionally, the AEC have some questions, outlined below, I’m hoping you can provide clarification on: 

  Seeking information under a legal notices (section 321F Notice – information and documents). Please 

 

confirm if TikTok’s preferred process is for AEC to email 
If AEC believes a TikTok video/post is in violation of the terms of service or breaches a law (Commonwealth 
and include a URL to 
Electoral Act 1918 (Cth)), that it is preferred for AEC to email 
the relevant content and a description of the specific law/policy AEC believes it violates.  

  Any information you can share on TikTok’s data retention policy, specifically, what period of time is data 
retained for, and what are TikTok’s limits on disclosing information (e.g. general disclosure request (for 
user/handle information) or under a Notice request). 

We’re also appreciative of the referral pathway 
to provide some further information around the expected timings for incident handling, we’d be grateful.  

 stepped us through in the meeting. However, if you’re able 

Looking forward to hearing from you soon and working together over the coming months. If you have any 
questions regarding the above please don’t hesitate to reach out.  

Kind regards,  

 | Project Officer
