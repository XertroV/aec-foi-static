CURRENT ENROLMENT FIGURES, TRENDS 

Issue

Key facts and figures 









16,424,248 Australians were enrolled to vote in the 2019 federal election,
representing an enrolment rate of 97.0 per cent.

Key points 

The Australian Electoral Commission works to ensure the full electoral
participation of all eligible Australians. The electoral roll for the 2019
federal election was the largest and most complete ever.

A record 16,424,248 Australians were determined as enrolled to vote in
the 2019 federal election, from of an estimated eligible population of
16.9 million people. This represents an enrolment rate of 97.0 per cent, an
increase on the previous record rate for the 2016 federal election.

Background 

2019 federal election 

 A record 16,424,248 electors were enrolled from of an estimated eligible population of

16.9 million people. This represents a national enrolment rate of 97.0 per cent.







Immediately following the roll close the AEC reported a preliminary enrolment rate of
96.8 per cent. This, however, was subsequently revised to 97.0 per cent following the
application of more up-to-date eligible enrolment population estimates.

The enrolment rate exceeded the AEC’s target of 95 per cent in all states and territories
except the Northern Territory, where it increased from 81.1 per cent at the 2016 election
to 83.9 per cent.

The youth enrolment rate (18-24 year olds) was 88.8 per cent. Like the general
population, young people are enrolled at record levels.

Current state of the roll 

 As at 30 September 2019, the national enrolment rate was 96.8 per cent, which is

0.2 percentage points lower than for the 2019 federal election.





It is normal for the enrolment rate to decline following an election. The estimated number
of people not enrolled has grown by around 37,000 since the election with the vast
majority of these being people who turned 18 following the election.

In the lead up to the 2019 election, the AEC conducted an enrolment stimulation exercise,
targeting 410,000 people nationally who were not enrolled.

Youth enrolment 

 Younger electors tend to enrol in proximity to an electoral event.



The youth enrolment rate (18-24 year olds) as at 30 September 2019 was 86.5 per cent
with 1,643,338 enrolled youth, a reduction of 2.3 percentage points since the federal
election.

 While the AEC works to maintain the youth enrolment rate as high as possible, it is not

unusual for the youth enrolment rate to improve at the time of a federal election and then
decline between elections.

Indigenous enrolment 



The AEC commenced publication of Indigenous enrolment rate estimates by state and
territory as at 30 June 2018.

 A previous national Indigenous enrolment estimate of 58 per cent was calculated in 2014

using a different methodology.



The national Indigenous enrolment rate estimate remains steady and as at 30 June 2019
the rate was 76.6 per cent compared with 76.4 per cent in 2018.

 Any gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous enrolment rates is concerning.



The AEC is working to ensure the full electoral participation of all eligible Australians
and is investing in partnerships and targeted activities that extend its reach into remote
communities. Remote Area Mobile Polling remains an important component of election
service delivery.

Northern Territory enrolment 





Enrolment in the Northern Territory has shown consistent improvement.

The enrolment rate in the Northern Territory increased by 9.8 percentage points between
30 June 2010 and 30 June 2019 while the national enrolment rate increased by
7.4 percentage points.
