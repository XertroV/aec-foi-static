Hi 

Andrew has now approved a revised version of this being shared with EIAT, as below. We’ve further modified this to 
strengthen the emphasis there was no compromise, and removed unnecessary detail about the AEC’s internal 
response. It is primarily the targeted nature of the content that should be relevant for EIAT’s purposes. 

Dear EIAT members 

For your information and awareness, we would like to bring to your attention a recent ‘spear phishing’ email 
campaign at the AEC.  The detail of these emails is below.   

AEC systems were not compromised in any way. We believe this is worthwhile sharing with the EIAT on the 
basis that despite being contained by the AEC, the campaign appears targeted and somewhat 
sophisticated.  It is possible it relates to the proposed referendum given the targeting of AEC’s Indigenous 
Electoral Participation Program mailboxes.  

It is a reminder that the cyber threat environment for the proposed referendum is unlikely to be lower than 
for a federal election.

Hi Andrew 

I think 

 may have discussed this with you.  

Are you supportive if we notify EIAT members of this incident? The benefit would be to ensure EIAT members 
remain alert to the threats in the referendum environment and particularly reinforce that it is not necessarily a 
lower cyber threat environment compared to a federal election. 

We would propose sharing the incident summary below (happy if you have a more recent version) and introduce it 
along the lines below so as not to alarm anyone or otherwise imply that the AEC was compromised. 

Dear EIAT members 

For your information and awareness, we would like to bring to your attention a recent ‘spear phishing’ 
attempt at the AEC.  The incident summary is below.

Grateful for your thoughts.

Good Morning 

Please refer below for a high level summary that consolidates yesterday’s incident response so we are all on the 
same page as to what happened including the resulting mitigation actions.  While the incident has now been closed 
from a response perspective, 

. 

The nature of the targeted phishing campaign and the resulting incident response may make an excellent case study 
for broader awareness activities in the future. 

Let me know if additional information is required and note we’ve purposely left the more technical details out of 
this summary. 

Regards 

Andrew
