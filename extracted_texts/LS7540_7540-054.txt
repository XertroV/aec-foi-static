Dear { MERGEFIELD First_Name } { MERGEFIELD Surname }, 

My name is Maria from the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) in Canberra. I’m emailing 
you today as the AEC have received an application to register Australian Democrats as a 
federal political party. 

Under section 123 of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 a registered political party must 
have at least 500 members who are on the Commonwealth Electoral Roll. 

To verify a party’s membership list, the AEC checks a random sample of the membership list 
provided by the party. 

The Australian Democrats provided your name on its membership list and your name has 
been selected at random. To verify that you are a member of the party, please reply to this 
email with the response that applies to you: 

a. My name is ……[your name here]……………….. 

“I am a member of Australian Democrats” 

 OR, if you are not a member of the party 

2. My name is ……[your name here]……………….. 

“No, I am not a member of Australian Democrats” 

You can also contact me directly on 02 6271 4521 to confirm whether you are a member of 
the party. 

It is important that you respond to this email as a certain number of members must confirm 
their membership of the party for the application to be successful. 
Please feel free to contact me if you have any queries. 

Kind Regards 

Party Registration Team
