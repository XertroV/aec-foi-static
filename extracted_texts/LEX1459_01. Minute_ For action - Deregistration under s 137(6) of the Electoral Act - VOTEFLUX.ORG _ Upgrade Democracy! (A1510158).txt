VOTEFLUX.ORG | Upgrade Democracy! (the Party) 

Purpose 

This minute asks you, as a delegate of the Electoral Commission, to deregister the Party under 
s 137(6) of the Electoral Act on the grounds that the Party does not have at least 1,500 members 
(s 137(1)(b) of the Electoral Act).  

Authority 

Sections 123, 137, 138 and 138A of the Electoral Act. 

Background 

On 13 January 2022, you, as a delegate of the Electoral Commission, issued a notice to the 
Registered Officer of the Party, Mr Nathan Spataro, under s 137 of the Electoral Act (the s 137 
Notice) stating that the Electoral Commission is considering deregistering the Party (OBJECT IDs: 
A1319272 and A1442167). The Registered Officer of the Party had until 13 February 2022 to provide 
a response.  

On 13 February 2022, the Party responded to the s 137 Notice: 

•  Response received – OBJECT ID: A1369037 
•  Statement – OBJECT ID: A1369035 
•  Supplementary membership list – OBJECT ID: A1369039 

On 2 March 2022, you, as a delegate of the Electoral Commission, having considered the statement 
lodged by the Party, and membership list lodged in support of that statement containing 4,680 
names, requested that further membership testing be performed. In confirming your advice, you 
instructed to select the top 1,650 names for testing to conform with the AEC’s testing methodology

OFFICIAL 

Application to change the Party’s name, abbreviation and logo in the Register 

On 19 February 2022, the Party lodged an application in accordance with s 134 of the Electoral Act 
to change its name, abbreviation and logo in the Register (OBJECT ID: A1396302). The Party’s logo 
passed validation and has been assessed by CRE8IVE (OBJECT IDs: A1421693 and A1421695). If 
the Party is deregistered, the application lodged under s 134 of the Electoral Act will no longer be 
valid. 

Conclusion 

On 13 January 2022, a notice was issued a notice to the Registered Officer of the Party under s 137 
of the Electoral Act stating that the Electoral Commission is considering deregistering the Party 

On 13 February 2022, the party responded to the s 137 Notice providing a statement and a 
membership list in support of that statement. 

An assessment of the Party’s membership list was undertaken and based on the ABS methodology it 
demonstrated that the Party has failed to demonstrate to have at least 1,500 members.  

Accordingly, there are reasonable grounds on which you, as the delegate of the Electoral 
Commission, can be satisfied that the Party does not have at least 1,500 members. Based on this 
information, you may determine under s 138A of the Electoral Act that the Party is not an ‘eligible 
political party’ and should be deregistered. 

If you, as the delegate of the Electoral Commission is of this view, you should not deregister the 
Party under s 137 of the Electoral Act and advise the Registered Officer of this decision.
