Enquiry details

A trans-gender male to female person Divvi De Vendre has lodged an 
application to establish a political party "the Australian Women's Party". 
Whilst I have no objection to any individual starting a political party this 
name was already used some time ago and may confuse women like 
myself who would think it was the old party reactivated. I think another 
name should be used. the previous founders of the Australian Women's 
party have no connection with the proposal by Divvi De Vendre. Can you 
please let me know if this is legal to use the name of a prior party.
