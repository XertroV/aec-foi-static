Hi 

Thanks for your email. I’ve spoken with the AEC’s Media and Digital Engagement team, and we’re wondering if 
Monday 19 June at 10:00am would be a suitable time to meet and discuss TikTok’s on-platform referendum guide?  

Additionally, as you may be aware, the Speaker of the House of Representatives recently announced that a by-
election, for the federal electoral division of Fadden, has been called with voting day to be held on Saturday 15 July 
2023. The Electoral Integrity Assurance Taskforce will again provide assurance to the Australian Electoral 
Commissioner, and the Australian public, on the integrity of this electoral event.  Hoping you can confirm that 
TikTok’s Safety Enforcement Tool (TSET) is the best pathway should we need to refer content and that 
eiat@aec.gov.au, socialmedia@aec.gov.au and authorisationsection@aec.gov.au have been whitelisted to access 
the tool?  
When we last spoke on the phone, you offered to facilitate a short meeting between the AEC and your Trust and 
Safety team for a brief tutorial on how to use TSET. We’d be interested in taking you up on this offer and wondering 
if Thursday 15 June at 11am would work for your team?  

Happy to discuss these meetings further.  

Kind regards,

Hi 

Hoping you’re well and thank you for acknowledging receipt of our Regulatory Law teams letter 
week.

Recently, we received confirmation that you’ve transitioned to TikTok's Safety Enforcement Tool (TSET). I’m looking 
to confirm if socialmedia@aec.gov.au, authorisations@aec.gov.au, and eiat@aec.gov.au are the AEC emails with 
access the tool?  

Happy to discuss if you have any questions or concerns.  

Kind regards,

Good afternoon, 

I'm writing to let you know that the Australian Electoral Commission has been successfully on-boarded onto 
TikTok's Safety Enforcement Tool (TSET).
