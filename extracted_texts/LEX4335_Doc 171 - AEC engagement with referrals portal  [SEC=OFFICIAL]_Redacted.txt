AEC engagement with referrals portal [SEC=OFFICIAL]

Afternoon 
Hope you are going along well! Winter has well and truly hit here in Canberra, so I’m about ready to move to warmer locations
already!
By way of quick update, Mr Rogers and Mr Haigh appeared before a Senate Finance and Public Administration Committee hearing
on 4 May down in Melbourne, where they were asked about the engagement with online platforms including yourselves. I
understand the response referenced that we had met, that had been provided with additional escalation points for Twitter
referrals and that he was broadly comfortable with cooperation across platforms at this time. We are currently in preparations to
support Mr Rogers in his appearance at Senate Estimates in the week commencing Mon 22 May.
Looking to also follow up on our use of the new referrals process via the legal portal provided. Please see below for a list of the
posts referred to Twitter, as of middle of the day today, 15 May. We have removed previously reviewed/escalated/resolved items
outlined in our past correspondence for brevity. Disappointingly, according to our records, nil actions have been taken against any
of the below after significant time processing. As you would appreciate, the content of these referrals is of significant concern to
us, particularly with regards to threats towards AEC staff, and mis/disinformation regarding electoral processes.
For your background, the three highlighted referrals were originally made via the platform public channels (previous process),
then referred again via the legal portal when we switched over, as per your instructions. The other referrals were all made directly
via the legal portal. I am seeking to escalate the review of these referrals and re-open discussion more broadly on expectations
when using this channel. Please also let me know if there is different information we should be including or highlighting, or if there
are other ways that we can improve our requests.
I understand that you also received my email that provided a letter from our Regulatory Law team, and some additional
information that we hope will be of assistance to you in the lead up to the proposed referendum. If there are any questions
coming out of this, please do not hesitate to get in touch.
Many thanks,
