With regards to the agenda - I will give an update on TikTok's election prepardness work and support from the 

AEC so far (Election Guide, PSA's etc.). Itd also be useful if AEC could give any updates/or information 

regarding potential threats/risks to the Election which we can consider for our own preparation. 

May end up only being a 30 min meeting, but its good to have a bit of extra time at the end in case we need it! 

Kind regards

Hi Julie, 

It certainly is something that I have missed! 

Understood - we may have Singapore based staff joining us but it might be ok given the advance notice. Let me 
check with them and Ill get back to you Friday/Monday. 

Kind regards

Thanks 

, appreciate you making those changes.

Overseas travel - What a fantastic novelty at this point!
Of course happy to work with the availability of the team, I’m conscious that we may have an election
announcement by that week, and we will do our very best from this side to keep our appointments!

Looking at week commencing 4 April, are we just working with Aus based staff? If so, can I suggest 11am on
Tuesday 5 April, for an hour via Teams?

Cheers
Julie

Hi Julie, 

All actioned - yes we are certainly open to having another prep meeting prior to the election. 

Could we aim for first week April instead? My team will be overseas for a week at the end of March so it might 
be tricky for us then. 

Kind regards

Those referrals coming from our Authorisations team will be the legal ones, and those from Social Media team
more likely those against your Terms of Use.

Would actually be great for us as AEC to catch up with you once more before the election is announced? (let’s
say this month?) Just to run through everything and make sure we’re all sorted.

Cheers

Hi Julie, 

Hope you are well. 

I was going through our whitelist for Australian Government agencies using our dedicated reporting channels 
and noticed we only have two email addresses registered for the AEC: 

eiat@aec.gov.au
Your email

We discussed this almost a year ago now so I just wanted to make sure the AEC didnt have any other email 
addresses/teams that would likely be sending TikTok escalations. We will still respond to all escalations in our 
govreport inbox but its helps us address the issue more quickly if we already have confirmation as to who is 
sending the request. 

Kind regards
