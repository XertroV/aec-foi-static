3.  Removal of deceased electors 

•  The AEC employs a robust process to remove deceased electors from the roll and prevent 

deceased persons from being added to the electoral roll. 

•  The AEC manages the removal of deceased electors from the roll by collecting and 

analysing information from a variety of sources, including advice from the elector’s family 
and data from state registrars (Births, Deaths and Marriages), and other electoral 
authorities. 

• 

In the 12 months ending 31 March 2023, the AEC removed 147,700 deceased persons 
from the electoral roll.
