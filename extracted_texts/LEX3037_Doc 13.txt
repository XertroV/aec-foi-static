Dear Andrew and the AEC team, I hope this email finds you well and feeling rejuvenated after a summer
vacation?

With an eye to the upcoming Federal election, we'd like to offer you a briefing on Google's election integrity
work from colleagues that have worked on elections in other countries. Just wanted to gauge your interest in
such a briefing and if so, when you would like the briefing to take place.

Kind regards
