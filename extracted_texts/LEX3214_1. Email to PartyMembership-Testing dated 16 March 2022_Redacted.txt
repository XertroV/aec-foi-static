Dear 

This email has been sent from the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) regarding VoteFlux.Org (the Party). 

The AEC is currently reviewing the eligibility of the Party to retain federal registration. Federally registered political 
parties without a Member of Parliament or Senator are required under the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 to 
have at least 1500 members. 

Part of the review the Party supplied the AEC with a membership list. The AEC then conducts checks against the list 
and from it obtains a random sample and contact those individuals to check membership. 

Your name has come up in the random sample. To assist with this application the AEC is seeking a response as to 
whether you are, or are not, a member of VoteFlux.Org. Please reply to this email with the response that applies to 
you: 

1. My name is ………[your name here]……………….. 

“I am a member of VoteFlux.Org” 

OR, if you are not a member of the party

2. My name is ………[your name here]……………….. 

“No, I am not a member of VoteFlux.Org” 

You can also contact 1800 413 956 to provide your response. 

It is important that you provide a response to the AEC. If no response is received, you will be marked as a non-
response. 

Kind regards
