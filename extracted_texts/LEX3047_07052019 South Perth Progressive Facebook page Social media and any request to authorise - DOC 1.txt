@aec.gov.au> 

Hi 

I’m hoping you can provide some advice on the following Facebook Page: https://www.facebook.com/South-
Perth-Progressive-389307874990668/ 

The Facebook Page is purporting to be a community group and is running paid political advertising into Swan. 

Here’s a link to the unauthorised video: https://www.facebook.com/389307874990668/videos/435215877282051/ 

(Note: Some other ads on the Facebook Page are correctly authorised by the Labor Party.) 

In the about section, it claims to be authorised by a ‘

Salter Point’. 

 is a Member of the WA Labor Party and heavily involved in their campaign in Swan. 

I’m unsure how this information changes the authorisation requirements, but in addition to being very misleading 
by purporting to be a community group that now actively involved in political advocacy and not providing an address 
in the authorisation, the fact 
the authorisation? 

 is heavily involved in Labor’s campaign might also need to be identified in 

We don’t want to draw public attention to the Page, but would like some assistance to rectify the issue. 

Are you able to let me know if the Page fails to meet the Electoral Commission’s authorisation requirements? This 
will also be helpful when I contact Facebook.
