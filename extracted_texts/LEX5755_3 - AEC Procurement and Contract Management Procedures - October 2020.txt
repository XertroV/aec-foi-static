1.  Introduction 

Scope 
The Procurement and Contract Management Procedures (the Procedures) are intended to allow AEC 
personnel to better understand the Commonwealth’s procurement policy and framework. The Procedures 
emphasise the responsibilities of AEC personnel, and the AEC’s expectations in undertaking 
procurements of any value on behalf of the AEC and the Australian Government. 

AEC personnel who are required to spend public money of any value or enter into an Agreement must 
comply with the Commonwealth Resource Management Framework. 

In these Procedures all monetary figures are inclusive of GST, unless otherwise specified. 

Commonwealth Resource Management Framework 
AEC personnel must procure Services in accordance with the: 

(a)  Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Act 2013 (PGPA Act), 

(b)  Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Rules 2014 (PGPA Rules),  

(c)  Commonwealth procurement framework, including: 

(i) 

the Commonwealth Procurement Rules (CPRs);  

(ii)  Resource Management Guides; 

(iii) 

templates such as the Commonwealth Contracting Suite (CCS); and 

(iv) 

the Department of Finance’s procurement policy website and guidance,  

(d)  Commonwealth Indigenous Procurement Policy (IPP); and 

(e)  AEC internal procedures and operational guidelines, including: 

(i) 

the Accountable Authority Instructions (AAIs), specifically AAIs (Part 2); and 

(ii) 

these Procedures. 

How to use these Procedures 
The Procedures provide information and processes for AEC personnel completing procurement and 
contract management activities. Additional information on key areas of the Procedures are included in 
the Appendices. 

Exclusions 
Travel arrangements for AEC personnel are only considered in these Procedures to the extent that the 
arrangements require a legal review (e.g. Contingent Liabilities). Contact AEC Travel for further 
information on arranging travel.  

Grants are not included in these Procedures. 

Resources and Templates

3.  Procurement 

Overview 
Procurement encompasses the whole process of procuring goods and services, beginning when a need 
has been identified and a decision has been made on the procurement requirement. 

At a high level a procurement activity follows the below process flow: 

Establish business 
requirement(s)

Retrieve approval to 
proceed (Business 
case or other)

Plan the 
procurement

Consider probity 
obligations

Draft Approach to 
Market (ATM) 
documentation

Retrieve approval for 
ATM

Release ATM

Evaluate responses 
to ATM

Document evaluation 
process and outcome

Retrieve spending 
approval

Negotiate contract

Execute contract

When taking part in a procurement activity, AEC personnel and AEC Financial Delegates must:  

(a)  act in accordance with legislation, policy and procedural requirements; 

(b)  act within appropriation, authorisation or delegation;  

(c) 

act ethically, fairly and impartially; 

(d)  achieve VFM at all times; 

(e)  act in an open, accountable and transparent manner; and 

(f) 

encourage competition and non-discrimination. 

Irrespective of the size or nature of any procurement, AEC personnel must seek to achieve VFM in 
accordance with the CPRs to ensure AEC Financial Delegates are satisfied that a VFM outcome has 
been reached. 

When a business requirement arises, AEC personnel should consider how a procurement will deliver 
the best VFM outcome. This should begin by clearly understanding and expressing the goals and 
purpose of the procurement, and must include consideration to leverage any existing AEC 
arrangements. 

AEC personnel must exercise caution to ensure they do not enter into an Agreement orally (or give the 
perception of) or by the exchange of non-contractual documents, letters or emails. Unknowingly 
entering into an Agreement can occur, for example, where a AEC personnel instruct a Supplier to 
proceed with the Services before the commencement date of an Agreement.

Important Note: VFM and proper use of public resources 

Achieving  VFM  is  the  core  rule  of  the  CPRs.  VFM  is  not  determined  by  which  response  is  the 
cheapest.  Dollar  value  is  just  one  component  of  an  overall  VFM  assessment.  All  of  the  VFM 
considerations (including non-pricing considerations) must be analysed, all decisions/outcomes are 
to be well substantiated and fully documented to establish a transparent and defensible VFM outcome 
for the AEC.  

Notable considerations for the VFM assessment are: 

  Consideration of full tendered contract value, including whole-of-life costs, 
  Comparison  of  the  tendered  contract  value  to  the  estimated  contract  value  as  per  the 

procurement plan, 

  Competition noted within the procurement process, including:  

o  how many submissions were received, 
o  analysis of trends in pricing submissions; and 
o  negotiations undertaken to reduce tendered values. 

  Value adds and benefits to the AEC, 
  Document any changes in scope from initial estimate,  
  Any clarification undertaken to ensure consistency in respondent approach; and 
  Risk exposure to the AEC presented in submissions. 

AEC personnel responsible for a procurement must be satisfied, after reasonable enquiries, that the 
procurement achieves a VFM outcome. Refer CPRs Division 1: Rules for all procurements. 

VFM should always be considered throughout the entire procurement process, including when looking 
to extend or vary a contract that increases the contract value. 

AEC Delegates are responsible for ensuring that the commitment of relevant money is a proper use of 
public resources - efficient, effective, economical and ethical - that is consistent with the policies of the 
Commonwealth. AEC Delegates must assure themselves that a procurement activity has: 

facilitates accountable and transparent decision making,  

  encouraged competition and is non-discriminatory, 
 
  encourages appropriate engagement and management of risk; and  
 

is commensurate with the scale and scope of the business requirement. 

Procurement workflow 
The following flowchart depicts the basic workflow for a procurement process. However, tasks required 
to comply with the CPRs will vary depending on the procurement method, value, complexity and risk, 
and as such these Procedures must be read as a whole.

Do other business areas have the same or similar requirements within 
the AEC? 

AEC personnel must understand what the market for the Services required is within the AEC: 

(a)  Do other business areas require similar or the same Services? 

(b)  Does another business area already have an Agreement in place for the Services? 

(c) 

Is there a sufficient requirement in the AEC to establish a panel arrangement for those Services? 

AEC personnel should also look at the Election Procurement Strategy to answer these questions. 

What does the supply market dictate about the requirements? 

To fully understand the market associated with a procurement AEC personnel should conduct market 
research to a scale appropriate to the procurement activity as a whole. For the purposes of 
procurement, market research is the act of gathering, analysing and interpreting information about 
the particular market in which the AEC is proposing to conduct a procurement. 

Market research can provide a strategic understanding of: 

(a)  how a market works, 

(b) 

the direction in which a market is moving (e.g. technological advancement), 

(c) 

the competitiveness of a market, 

(d) 

key suppliers, 

(e) 

sustainability options in the market; and 

(f) 

how to manage price variations over time or between suppliers. 

Methods for conducting market research include: 

(a)  online research,  

(b) 

contacting other Australian Government agencies, 

(c) 

consulting subject matter experts, 

(d)  phone surveys, 

(e) 

visits to local potential supplier, 

(f) 

conducting workshops; and 

(g) 

conducting a request for expression of interest (EOI) or request for information (RFI).  

Tip: Care must be taken to avoid the perception that any Potential Supplier has received information 
that provides them with an unfair competitive advantage, or the perception that work has been 
promised. Additional information on market research can be found in Appendix 1 of these Procedures. 

What are the procurement risks? 

AEC personnel must identify, analyse, allocate and treat risk throughout the entire procurement and 
contract management process. 

Depending on an initial assessment and value, a full risk assessment may be required. 

Additional information on Procurement and Contract Risk can be found in Appendix 2 of these 
Procedures. 

As part of managing risk, the AEC Financial Delegate may require additional assurance by way of a 
financial analysis of the procurement and/or any Potential Suppliers. For any procurements valued at 
$200k and above, it is recommended that business areas seek financial advice from the Financial 

AEC Procurement and Contract Management Procedures

--- Page 14 ---

Open tenders 

An open tender involves publishing a Request for Tender (RFT) to the market and inviting 
Submissions from any interested Suppliers via the AusTender website. 

Limited tenders 

Limited tenders involve approaching one or more Potential Suppliers to make Submissions when the 
procurement process does not meet the rules for open tenders. 

For procurements valued at or above the threshold of $80 000, a limited tender can only be conducted 
in accordance with paragraph 10.3 of the CPRs or when a procurement is exempt, as detailed in 
Appendix A of the CPRs, as supported by a business case, approved by the AEC Financial Delegate 
and attached to the Approach to Market in My Procurement. 

AEC personnel must contact CLP if considering undertaking a limited tender valued at or above $80, 
000. 

Is there an Indigenous enterprise that I can approach? 

The Indigenous Procurement Policy (IPP) mandates that Indigenous Enterprises be considered for the 
delivery of Services valued between $80,000 and $200,000, on a value for money basis prior to 
approaching the market. 

Additional information on the Indigenous Procurement Policy can be found in Appendix 3 of these 
Procedures. 

Are there any existing arrangements that can meet the AEC’s business 
requirements? 

Accessing Services through Existing Arrangements established by the AEC or other Commonwealth 
agencies (often referred to as ‘piggybacking’) may save the AEC time, resources and expense in 
conducting separate procurement processes. It can also enable the AEC to access more favourable 
rates and conditions that other larger agencies were able to negotiate. 

Procurements from Existing Arrangements are only subject to the rules in Division 1 of the CPRs. 
However, the establishment of an Existing Arrangement is subject to both Division 1 and 2 of the 
CPRs. 

Where there is an Existing Arrangement available to the AEC, with a scope that clearly meets the 
AEC’s requirements, AEC personnel may use that Arrangement. 

Important: If you intend on accessing an Existing Arrangement instead of completing an Open 
Tender procurement process, a business case, approved by the AEC Financial Delegate and 
attached to the Approach to Market in My Procurement, is required to outline the decision making 
process. The business case must include the following information at a minimum: 

  why the Arrangement is being accessed,  
  how the scope of the Arrangement meets the AEC’s business needs,  
  what Potential Suppliers will be approached; and  
  why you have selected those Potential Suppliers. 

Important: IF you intend on accessing an Existing Arrangement, AEC Contact Officers should 
consider how many Potential Suppliers are to be approached. Note that it will be very difficult to 
assess and demonstrate the achievement of value for money if only one Potential Supplier is 
approached. 

AEC Procurement and Contract Management Procedures

Existing Arrangements may include: 

(a)    Whole of Australian Government (WoAG) arrangements 

These are Arrangements, some of which are mandated, established by the Department of 
Finance to benefit Commonwealth agencies for the procurement of Services. 

The Department of Finance procurement website provides the full consolidated list of these 
arrangements. When purchasing from an Arrangement, AEC personnel must ensure that the: 

(i) 

Services required are within the scope of the Arrangement; 

(ii) 

terms and conditions of the Arrangement are not being materially altered; and 

(iii) 

relevant templates are used to procure the Services. 

An Agreement is formed under an Arrangement when a Work Order is issued, or executed by 
both parties, as specified in the Head Agreement or Deed of Standing Offer. The Work Order 
together with the Head Agreement or Deed of Standing Offer form the Agreement. 

(b)    AEC National Panels 

The AEC has established National Panels for the provision of furniture and equipment, logistics 
and ballot material printing to ensure nationally consistent arrangements for key election 
services. 

Refer to the Election Procurement Strategy intranet page for guidance on procuring under these 
Arrangements. 

(b)    Recruitment and labour hire services 

National Work Orders (WOs) are in place with six (6) providers for the provision of 
recruitment and related services (excludes ICT recruitment). These WOs can be used by any 
business area within the AEC to fulfil recruitment and labour hire needs for both BAU and 
elections (as a contingency only to fulfil larger TEW requirements). 

It is not mandatory to use these WOs but it is considered to be good practice should they 
meet your business requirements. 

These WOs do not replace any existing contracts for recruitment services. 

These WOs can be accessed using a simple 5-step process. Guidance on how to use these 
arrangements includes FAQs and applicable templates, as well as a capability matrix that 
provides contact details of providers and their service capabilities and jurisdictions. This 
document, as well as other relevant documents, are available through the CLP’s SharePoint 
site. AEC staff need permission to access this site. Submit a request to access the site by 
contacting Commercial Law and Procurement. 

 (c)    Panel arrangements 

A panel arrangement (also known as Standing Offer Panel) is the end result of a procurement 
process, where a number of Suppliers are appointed through a head agreement or deed of 
standing offer. 

A list of Existing (Panel) Arrangements that the AEC has access to can be found on the CLP’s 
SharePoint site.  AEC personnel wishing to utilise one of these Existing Arrangements should 
first contact the relevant AEC Panel Manager to obtain general information and guidance on 
approaching the Existing Arrangement. Existing Arrangement documentations i.e. Agreements, 
templates and related documents can be found on DS4P. If an AEC Official requires access to 
DS4P they must contact CLP.

7.  Vehicle hire 

Whole of Australia Government arrangement (WoAG) 
All vehicle hires within Australia must be made through the WoAG contracted provider, Hertz.  

If vehicle hire is being arranged with domestic flights, it can be booked through the Online Booking Tool.  

If you are only hiring a vehicle, you can book direct with Hertz, online or by telephone. The terms and 
conditions for hiring vehicles from Hertz are contained in the Deed between the Department of Finance 
and Hertz.  

Upon collection of a vehicle from Hertz, the AEC official may be required to sign a document. The 
purpose of this document is to identify the Authorised Driver. Clause 14.2 of the Deed that the 
Department of Finance has in place with Hertz confirms this by stating that the Deed prevails over any 
other rental agreements, provisions or terms. Accordingly, the legal risk to the AEC is low if an AEC 
official is required to sign other terms and conditions as the terms of the Deed can be relied on. To limit 
the risk further however, we recommend resisting the requirement to sign any other document. 

More information about vehicle hire under the WoAG arrangement can be found on the Department of 
Finance's website. In particular you may find the Department of Finance's FAQ section useful. 

General AEC procedures for hiring vehicles are contained in the AEC's Travel Procedures.  

Alternative providers 
Where a Hertz rental office is not within reasonable proximity, or no vehicles are available, AEC personnel 
may use an alternative provider that represents best value for money.  

In such instances, AEC personnel must: 

a.  seek Commercial Law and Procurement section advice on the alternative provider's terms and 

conditions before you enter into any agreement; and 

b.  advise AEC Travel in order that it can be reported to Department of Finance for contract review 

and compliance purposes.  

To help make this process quicker for business areas, legal advice has been provided below for 
alternative providers that the AEC has previously used. If a business area uses a provider on a regular 
basis and they are not listed on the Vehicle Hire intranet page, please provide the terms and conditions to 
CLP for review as soon as possible. Further, if a business area becomes aware that a provider listed on 
the Vehicle Hire intranet page has changed their terms and conditions, please provide the updated terms 
and conditions to CLP for review as soon as possible. 

Indemnities 
MOST vehicle hire arrangements, including those under the WoAG arrangement, require the AEC to 
indemnify the provider. Under section 60 of the Public Governance, Performance and Accountability 
(PGPA) Act 2013, the AEC cannot grant an indemnity in any arrangement unless there is delegate 
approval.  

PGPA Section 60 Blanket Approval and Risk Assessment 
To simplify the PGPA section 60 approval process and support compliance, the Chief Legal Officer has 
provided blanket approval based on a standard risk assessment for vehicle hire which can be found on 
the Vehicle Hire intranet page. 

Note that this PGPA section 60 blanket approval only applies where:  

a.  a provider is used under the WoAG arrangement (ie. Hertz); or 

AEC Procurement and Contract Management Procedures 

Page 33 of 90


--- Page 34 ---

b.  another provider is engaged and their standard terms and conditions have been reviewed by CLP 

and legal advice provided; and 
the risks of hire are adequately addressed in the risk assessment attached to the blanket approval. 

c. 

For the avoidance of doubt, if an AEC official determines that the risks of hire (including through Hertz 
under the WoAG arrangement) are not adequately addressed in the standard risk assessment, a new risk 
assessment and PGPA section 60 approval will need to be undertaken separately. 

Other points to note when hiring vehicles 
PGPA Rule 18 approval is required prior to the hire of a vehicle from any provider (Hertz or alternative 
provider).  

The email for financial delegate approvals under $10,000 can be used for Hertz vehicle hire, or alternative 
provider vehicle hire where the cost is less than $10,000 (GST inclusive) and the purchase will be made 
by an AEC Corporate Credit Card.  

All other vehicle hire (of any value) from an alternative provider must be entered into My 
Procurement and Rule 18 approval obtained through the Spending Proposal (Stage 2) process.  

Questions about the travel policy should be directed to AEC Travel.

(d) 

(e) 

complete a contract risk assessment and risk mitigation plan if required; (d)    address any 
issues that were not resolved when the Contract was signed; 

follow up with the Supplier/s on key initial obligations, such as obtaining evidence of their 
insurances , financial viability and signed Deed Polls from Specified Personnel; 

(f) 

identify how the achievement of deliverables will be measured; 

(g)  establish processes for monitoring and reporting on the performance of the Supplier in relation 

to the key performance indicators; and 

(h)  establish roles and responsibilities for internal stakeholders. 

Note: The above items are inclusions within the CMP template developed for your use. 

Administer the Contract 

To assist with the overall management of the Contract, it is important that Contract Managers: 

(a) 

regularly review and update the Contract Management Plan including risk assessment when 
appropriate; 

(b)  maintain up to date records of key personnel and contact details; 

(c) 

(d) 

schedule meetings at specific times throughout the life of the Contract, giving the time, place 
and purpose of the meeting as well as any planned reviews or other key actions;  

inspect Services on delivery (particularly where delivery will be phased) to ensure they meet the 
standards specified in the Contract, 

(e)  make payments only in accordance with the terms of the Contract, 

(f) 

(g) 

document  any  changes,  significant  decisions  or  events  and  file  all  documentation  and 
correspondence in relation to any procurement; 

report to senior management and stakeholders on the status of the Contract at appropriate 
intervals; and, 

(h)  develop and maintain an effective and professional relationship with the Suppli er. 

Relationship Management 

Relationship management is an essential element to contract management, and a basis for this 
relationship can often be established in the procurement phase. However, if a Contract Manager is 
new to the procurement or the contractual arrangement, the Contract Manager must undertake to 
understand the relationship that already exists between the AEC and the Supplier. This includes 
understanding any problems or issues that occurred earlier in the procurement process. 

The type of contract (including size, duration, deliverables, personalities involved) will influence the 
relationship between the parties to the arrangement, and the structure of your approach to managing 
the relationship. It is important to develop and maintain a constructive relationship with regular 
communication and this can be achieved through both informal (e.g. day to day discussions and 
interactions), and formal (e.g. formal contract management meetings and performance reviews with 
nominated personnel) means. Formal meetings should be captured in your CMP. 

An effective relationship with your Supplier can allow the quick and simple identification and resolution 
of issues, before they become critical to the delivery of the contract.  Maintaining a good relationship 
does not mean that the terms of a contract are not enforced, rather it is about professionally enforcing 
the terms of a contract based on evidence of contractual performance. 

Relationships should be managed professionally and be based on cooperation and mutual 
understanding. It is important to remember that this relationship is a professional one and should not 
become too intimate, as this can affect your ability to manage the arrangement and can bring ethics 
and probity considerations into question. 

AEC Procurement and Contract Management Procedures

Stakeholder and Communication Management 

It is important to ensure that stakeholders to the contract are kept informed of relevant matters such as 
contract developments, and are continually engaged or consulted where required throughout the life of 
the contract. In order to achieve this you should first identify the internal and external stakeholders, 
and their role in relation to the Arrangement. 

A key item to consider at this point is any other AEC contractual arrangement that may have 
intersecting contract deliverables. This is an important step in developing a system to manage 
information between Suppliers with intersecting deliverables, to ensure a coordinated and seamless 
delivery of the operational activity relating to the arrangements. Intersecting contract deliverables could 
include scenarios such as; the manufacturer for Cardboard material and the Supplier contracted to 
manage collection/delivery; or, a hired premise and a furniture hire company; or a Ballot Material 
Printing Supplier and the Supplier contracted to manage collection/delivery. 

Communication Plan 

A Communication Plan should be developed as part of a CMP to identify the type of information that 
needs to be shared with/between Stakeholders, the frequency, the method and where the 
responsibility sits for sharing the information. 

This should include how you will communicate Services to be delivered under the contract to end 
users; how you will receive feedback on Supplier Performance from end users; how you will engage 
with your Supplier for ongoing contract requirements (including performance issues); how you will 
engage with other Internal / External stakeholders. 

Performance Management 

Effective management of a Contract is the most efficient means of ensuring performance is in line with 
contractual obligations. Contract Managers must undertake performance management over the life of 
the Contract in accordance with the provisions of the Contract, including non-performance provisions. 

Performance management involves: 

(a)  performance monitoring to ensure that progress is being made in line with agreed time frames, 
and that the Supplier is performing in accordance with the Contract. Contract Managers should 
focus on monitoring the key deliverables outlined in the Contract, as very deta iled monitoring 
can be costly and shift the focus away from achieving outcomes; 

(b)  determining whether performance meets the AEC’s needs through performance assessments.  

(c)  The primary responsibility for performance rests with the Contract Manager, who should en sure 

that standards and targets are met on time and within budget; 

(d) 

taking appropriate action such as correcting areas of underperformance through contract 
management mechanisms, or amending the contract requirements to meet changing needs. If 
performance issues  cannot  be resolved  by the  AEC  Contract  Manager,  this  should  be 
escalated in accordance with the escalation process identified in your CMP (see the AE C 
Escalation Framework section of these Procedures and Appendix 12); 

(e)  making  reasonable  enquiries   to   determine   compliance   with   any   applicable   Standards 

including:  

(i) 

gathering evidence of relevant certifications; and 

(ii) 

periodic auditing of compliance by an independent assessor, and 

(f) 

seeking reasonable evidence to satisfy the AEC that contractors have not breached the regulations 
and/or regulatory frameworks and have demonstrated their sustainability credentials. 

AEC Procurement and Contract Management Procedures 

Page 37 of 90


--- Page 38 ---

It is important that Contract Managers attempt to address any issues with the Supplier (including under 
performance) at the lowest possible level in the first instance. It should also be considered what role 
the AEC may have played in contributing to the issue, as a contract includes obligations on both 
parties to the arrangement. 

Managing under performance 

(a)  Contract Managers should address any problems with the Supplier promptly, in accordance with 
the terms of the Contract. While there is no set procedure for managing under performance, it is 
essential to clearly address poor performance as soon as the problem is identified, including 
providing timeframes for resolution if appropriate. The longer poor performance is allowed to 
continue, the more difficult it becomes to attain a satisfactory resolution. 

(b)  When addressing issues of non-performance with a Supplier, Contract Managers should 

specifically identify the problem, and determine how wide the gap is between what is expected, 
and what is being delivered. Contract Managers should address the issue with the Supplier in a 
professional, fair and just manner, documenting all meetings and communications. 

(c)  Generally, consequences for under performance will be addressed in the Contract, and may involve: 

(i) 

replacing Specified Personnel; 

(ii) 

using additional Specified Personnel; 

(iii)  amending progress reporting procedures to make status reports more frequent;  

(iv)  modifying processes or systems; 

(v) 

clarifying the AEC’s requirements with the Supplier, escalation involving senior management 
from both parties in formal discussions or written communications; or 

(vi)  withholding payments until the performance returns to an acceptable level (this remedy must 
reflect the seriousness of the underperformance, and careful consideration needs to be given 
when adopting this approach). 

(d)  In formally addressing underperformance, Contract Managers must follow any formal escalation 
procedures as identified in the Contract where necessary. Contract Managers should contact 
CLP for advice when dealing with formal under performance.   Any formal management of a 
performance issue should must be recorded in the Supplier Performance Register section of the 
CLP’s SharePoint site (for procurements valued at or above $80 000). 

(e)  All major stakeholders should be regularly informed of the status of the Contract and Supplier’s 

performance, particularly where there are any issues. 

Managing disputes 

(a)  Disagreements and disputes often arise when the parties cannot agree on issues related to the 

interpretation of the provisions of the Contract, the definition of deliverables, meeting performance 
standards and/or the effect of unexpected events.  In most circumstances, disputes will be reduced 
where both parties have a sound understanding of their roles and responsibilities under the 
Contract. 

(b)  However, where a dispute arises, it is important that it is dealt with as quickly as possible in order 

to prevent escalating the matter, which may impact on deliverables. 

(c)  Contract Managers must strictly follow the dispute resolution procedures provided in the Contract. 

AEC Escalation Framework 

Contract management may at times involve managing and resolving issues that arise during and after 
the delivery of services by a contracted supplier. It is the responsibility of the nominated AEC Contract 
Manager to effectively and actively manage their contract, including resolving any issues experienced 
during the term of the agreement. However, at times a Contract Manager may be unable to adequately 

AEC Procurement and Contract Management Procedures 

Page 38 of 90


--- Page 39 ---

influence the situation with the Supplier’s Contract Manager, or may require approval or decisions to 
be made by the AEC that are above their level of authority. At these times, it may be required to 
escalate the issue in the appropriate channel within the AEC. 

The appropriate escalation channel within the AEC will vary for each contract, and it is important that  
Contract Managers identify this when establishing the CMP. 

The AEC Escalation Framework has been developed to assist Contract Managers in understanding 
their responsibilities in identifying the escalation process applicable to their contract, and prompt the 
development of communication channels with end users and identified escalation points to assist in 
effective management of the contract. The AEC Escalation Framework incorporates information in 
these Procedures, a Stepped Escalation Diagram including worked scenarios (see Appendix 12), in 
addition to sections included within the CMP template. 

Risk and Work Health Safety (WHS) 

Risk must be considered at all stages of the procurement process, including the contract management 
phase. It is important that a risk assessment is completed within your CMP to identify and mitigate 
potential risks that may impact on successful delivery of the contract. Additional information on Risk 
can be found in Appendix 2. 

The AEC must ensure that the work health safety of workers engaged by the AEC under contracts; 
and the safety of products the AEC procures and supplies to others. Entering into contracts creates 
shared WHS legislative duties for the AEC and the other party to the contract. 

AEC shared duties can be discharge in two ways: 

(a)  Directly - taking the necessary actions required, or 

(b) 

Indirectly - by requiring necessary actions to be taken by the AEC contracted Supplier on the 
AEC’s behalf, and then ensuring or verifying that the Supplier has completed these actions. 

The management of the WHS aspects of your contract should be recorded in your Contract 
Management Plan. Additional information on WHS legislation and requirements of AEC personnel can be 
found on the AEC intranet site for WHS and Safety. 

Contract variations and options to extend 

A variation is an amendment to a Contract that changes the Contract’s original terms or conditions. For 
example, you may need to vary a Contract if there is a change to the Services required, personnel or 
pricing. Provisions which allow for Contract variations should be outlined in the Contract. 

Variations must not significantly change the Contract requirement, or a substantial part of the original 
Contract. 

Important: Any proposed variation to an agreement must be assessed to ensure that the contract will 
continue to deliver value for money to the AEC, and does not breach the CPR’s. 

Tip: A variation to extend a Contract beyond the terms of the original Contract (rather than exercising an 
extension option within the terms of a Contract), is a new procurement that must be conducted in 
accordance with the CPRs. Variations to include new extension options generally increase the scope of 
the Contract and are therefore not allowed. 

An option to extend the term of a Contract is a legal right within a Contract to unilaterally extend the 
term of the Contract by a specified period. 

AEC Procurement and Contract Management Procedures 

Page 39 of 90


--- Page 40 ---

Provisions that allow for Contract variations must be outlined and exercised in accordance with the 
Contract and prior to the expiry date. A Contract cannot be varied to include extension options. 

Important: Before any extension option is taken, a Contract Evaluation must be completed. A contract 
evaluation template is available on the AEC Contract Management Intranet site for use. All contract 
evaluations are to be recorded in the Supplier Performance Register section of the CLP’s SharePoint 
Site SharePoint site. 

Options to extend 

Process 

(a)  Complete a variation request in My Contracts and submit to CLP.  

(b)  CLP will draft the required document (Deed of Variation or Letter of Extension) and email it to the 

Contract Manager.  

(c)  Once the request has been approved by CLP and the AEC Financial Delegate in My Contracts, the 

document can be issued to the Supplier.  

(d)  Contract  Managers  must  ensure  they  clearly  document  the  reasons  for varying the contract 

and/or exercising  the extension option and update the Contract Management Plan. 

(e)  The Contract Management Checklists in Appendix 13 can guide you in extending a Contract. 

Termination 

Termination of an Agreement is a serious step with potential probity and legal risks that must be 
considered before any decision is made. For this reason CLP must be consulted prior to any considering 
any termination. 

Handover (or transition out) 

Where a handover from the outgoing Supplier to a new Supplier is to occur, the process must be carefully 
managed. Ideally, handover arrangements should involve an agreed period of overlap where the new 
Supplier works alongside the outgoing Supplier to achieve as seamless a transition as possible. 

Attention should be paid to conditions in the Contract which relate to the handover, including any financial 
matters, intellectual property, transfer of material, and training procedures for the incoming Supplier. 

Evaluation and lessons learned  

A Contract Evaluation should be undertaken at the end of each Contract and should include an overall 
performance of the contract, including the AEC’s management of the contract. This can be useful in 
identifying lessons that have been learned throughout the life of the contract to better understand and 
improve overall contract management in future. 

When a transition from one Contract to another is to occur, it is best practice for an evaluation to be 
undertaken before the Contract ends so that any problems that have occurred with aspects of the 
Contractual arrangement are identified, and where appropriate, improvements made and implemented in 
future Contractual arrangements. 

AEC personnel are required to report to CLP any variations to any Contracts (eg. final expenditure is less 
than the Spending Value) in order that AusTender can be updated. 

The Contract Evaluation Template available on the AEC Contract Management intranet site can guide you 
in evaluating a Contract. 

AEC Procurement and Contract Management Procedures 

Page 40 of 90


--- Page 41 ---

The CLP SharePoint site includes a ‘Supplier Performance Register’ that must be used by business areas 
to record Contract Evaluations that have been completed at the end of a Contract. The Supplier 
Performance Register is intended to assist business areas in leveraging supplier performance 
information from across the AEC network and benchmark supplier performance. It may also be used to 
assist in conducting market research by identifying Suppliers that have provided excellent quality Goods / 
Services to the AEC.

11. Appendices 

Appendix 1 – Market Research and drafting a Statement of Requirement 

Market Research 

Overview 

Conducting market research is an important step to assist in planning your procurement. Collecting 
information about the market enables the AEC to: 

(a)     understand how the market works, its competitiveness, capabilities or constraints;  

(b)     better define AEC requirements; 

(c)     identify Potential Suppliers; 

(d)     better anticipate costs and timeframes; 

(e)     achieve value for money; 

(f)      minimise risks; and 

(g)     identify lessons learnt. 

The  results  of  market  research  should  be  documented  to  assist  in  justifying  any  decisions  made based 
on that research, and inform future market research conducted by the AEC. 

When conducting market research, care must be taken to avoid the perception that any Potential Supplier 
has received information that provides them with an unfair competitive advantage, or that work has been 
promised through this process. 

Sources 

Commensurate  with  the  scope,  scale,  value,  type  of  Services  required  and  estimated  risk  of  the 
procurement, market research can be undertaken: 

(a)     informally by: 

(i) 

contacting other Commonwealth agencies or other users of similar Services;  

(ii)  meet or call known or key stakeholders; 

(iii)  contacting the business area within the AEC relevant to the Services being procured for 

knowledge or advice (eg. ICT); 

(iv) 

reviewing existing market research conducted by a business area, 

(v) 

searching  My Procurement  for  previous  procurements  undertaken  or  Agreements  entered 
into; 

(vi)  attending industry exhibitions; 

(vii)  searching the Yellow Pages; 

(viii)  conducting searches on AusTender; and/or 

(ix)  conducting searches on the internet. 

(b)     formally via AusTender by undertaking an open approach to market through a multi-stage 

procurement process. Note that if you are intending to use a multi-stage approach, you must 
consult with CLP early in the planning stage as specific procurement rules apply. 

(c)     in rare cases, sourcing a specialist consultant to conduct the market research which in itself would 

be a separate procurement exercise. 

AEC Procurement and Contract Management Procedures 

Page 47 of 90


--- Page 49 ---

Analysis 

Following are some questions to consider when researching the market to determine how you will 
structure your approach to the market: 

(a)     Where do my requirements fit in the market? Is it insignificant, significant or innovative? 

(b)     What is the capability of the market in order to meet the AEC’s needs? Is it a well-developed, 

emerging or immature market? Is it dynamic and does it have a high level of business activity? Or is 
the industry on the decline or under threat? 

(c)     What is the risk profile of the market? Is there a risk to supply? 

(d)    What is the capacity of the market? Do skill shortages exist? Is the industry at full capacity?  Are 

there any seasonal factors? 

(e)     Are there any Australian standards, certifications, licences or professional accreditations 

applicable to the goods or services being procured? 

(f)      Do  any  relevant  regulations  and/or  regulatory  frameworks  apply  (eg.  National  Construction Code 
or Safework Australia regulatory framework)? (g)     What is the potential number of suppliers? 

(h)     How attractive are the requirements to suppliers? High or low? Can it be made more attractive? 

(i)      Are there any sensitivity or probity issues in the market  that my affect the procurement? Is there a 

high level of political interest or public sensitivity? 

In accordance with paragraph 10.30 of the Commonwealth Procurement Rules, if the procurement is 
valued above $4m, AEC personnel must consider what the economic benefit of the procurement is to the 
Australian economy. 

Consider how the Australian economy may benefit from the procurement activity. Consider what economic 
benefit information will be collected, and how it will be used as an evaluation criteria to assess value for 
money. 

The level of information collected should be commensurate with the procurement. It should not introduce 
excessive red tape and cost for tenderers bidding for government contracts. 

Drafting Statements of Requirements 

Overview 

The Statement of Requirements (SoR) is fundamental to the overall success of a procurement as it forms 
the foundation of the Agreement. The SoR should be comprehensively developed during the planning 
stage as this provides the best opportunity to consider what you want to achieve and clearly define the 
requirements. This will then guide the development of evaluation criteria for the procurement. 

What is an SoR? 

A  SoR  (also  known  as  business  requirements,  specifications  or  statement  of  work)  must  clearly, 
concisely and logically describe the Services that the AEC plans to procure. 

The SoR ensures that: 

(a)     Potential Suppliers can; clearly understand what is expected; calculate their quotation; confirm their 

capabilities and resources; and, develop an accurate response; 

(b)     the evaluation criteria can be easily and clearly defined. Responses can then be evaluated against clear 

criteria to assist in identifying overall value for money; 

(c)      the AEC can monitor performance and confirm that the goods and services are delivered according to our 

requirements; and 

(d)     potential risks are reduced. 

Commonwealth Procurement Rules (CPRs) 

AEC Procurement and Contract Management Procedures 

Page 48 of 90


--- Page 50 ---




--- Page 51 ---

Tip: The CPRs require minimum standard of information that must be included in request documentation 
(10.6), including estimated quantities (if the quantity is not known), the relative importance of evaluation 
criteria, and any known dates for the delivery of goods and services 

Structure of a SoR 

A SoR template  is available for use  as  a base when commencing to draft your requirements and may 
be amended as appropriate to address your particular requirements. 

Other considerations: 

     Service Level Agreements; 

     Key Performance Indicators; 

     Fee Credits; Performance payments; 

     Milestone payments; and, 

     Volume Discounts. 

In clearly detailing the AEC business requirements through developing a SoR, you can identify what 
contract mechanisms may be appropriate for your procurement and can be included in your 
documentation to market. This may include mechanisms such as a Service Level Agreements, Key 
Performance Indicators, a Fee Credit / Performance payment regime, Milestone Payments or a request for 
volume discounts. 

Service Level Agreements* / Key Performance Indicators* 

A Service Level Agreement (SLA) formalises the minimum level of service that is expected from Supplier.  
A  SLA  must  be specific,  measurable  and achievable and should be based on  the requirements 
included within the SoR. 

Key Performance Indicators is a conventional method of monitoring the performance of Suppliers and a 
contract. They are a set of agreed measures or metrics that are used to define and evaluate the critical 
success factors in a contract – a measure of how well something is being done. 

There are similarities between these mechanisms and different contract / procurements may be better 
suited to either of these approaches. Regardless of which mechanism is being used, the critical 
performance elements of the contract deliverables must be identified by the AEC Business Area before 
any agreement can be drafted. 

Fee Credits* / Performance Payments regimes* 

Fee Credits and Performance payments are often linked to SLA’s and KPI’s in contracts, and act as an 
incentive for Suppliers to meet the level of performance that is required in the contract. 

Milestone Payments and Volume Discounts 

AEC personnel should also consider if a milestone payment approach, or volume discounts, is appropriate 
to  include  within their procurement.  Milestone payments  may assist in  managing performance of a 
contract, and volume discounts may assist in demonstrating that Value for Money is achieved. 

* CLP is able to provide guidance and assist in drafting these items if required. 

“It’s often said that a requirement that is not specified up front is just a  
contract variation waiting to happen”

Where the estimated overall risk or risk ratings for premises or vehicle hire are considered high, alternate 
premises or vehicle hire should be sought. 

AEC personnel must ensure that risk assessments are regularly reviewed and updated throughout the entire 
procurement process so that any new risks or changes are identified and managed accordingly. 

Financial Management Service Level Options  

As part of managing risk, this may include assurance that the AEC Financial Delegate is satisfied with a 
financial analysis of the procurement and/or suppliers. For any procurements valued at $200k and 
above, it is recommended that business areas seek financial advice from the Financial Management 
Section. The services that can be provided by the Financial Management Section and how to request 
are outlined in the Financial Management Service Level Options for Procurements. 

Contract Management 

A Contract Management Plan (CMP) must be completed for Agreements valued over $80k or above, or for 
high risk, complex or significant election related Agreements. The Contract Management Plan includes a risk 
assessment that must be completed and regularly reviewed and updated when appropriate throughout the 
term of the Agreement. 

Tip: as outlined earlier, your contract Risk Assessment should focus on risks associated with management 
of the agreement, including delivery of Goods/Services. 

Further Information and Assistance 

The Disclosure, Assurance and Engagement Branch has responsibility for risk assessment and 
management within the AEC.  The Risk and Assurance section provides advice and assistance to AEC 
personnel on how to undertake risk assessments. For assistance contact

Appendix 3 – Indigenous Procurement Policy 

Overview 

The  mandatory  Indigenous  Procurement  Policy  (IPP)  aims  to  stimulate  the  Indigenous  business sector 
by leveraging the Commonwealth’s purchasing power to boost Indigenous Enterprises. An Indigenous 
Enterprise is any business that is 50 per cent or more Indigenous owned. 

The IPP has three main parts: 

(a)     a target number of contracts that need to be awarded to Indigenous Enterprises; 

(b)     a mandatory set-aside of  contracts for Indigenous  Enterprises to apply in certain situations; and 

(c)     mandatory minimum  requirements for  Indigenous  employment  and Indigenous  supplier  use applying 

to certain high value Commonwealth contracts. 

Further information and a copy of the IPP can be accessed at https://www.niaa.gov.au/resource-
centre/indigenous-affairs/indigenous-procurement-policyMandatory set-aside 

While Indigenous Enterprises can bid for any Approach to Market, the IPP requires that the AEC first check 
whether an Indigenous Enterprise can deliver Services if the procurement is: 

(a) 

valued between $80 000 and $200 000 of the initial agreement period; and/or 

(b)  a Remote Procurement (see  RIPP Location Map); and/or 

(c) 

the goods/services total $7.5 million during the initial agreement period AND where 50% of the 
agreement value is being delivered anywhere in Australia AND the goods/services are in any of  the 8 
industry categories listed on Section 4, Page 32 of the IPP. 

Note:  The  mandatory  set-aside  does  not  apply  if  the  procurement  method  is  to  approach  a 
mandatory whole of government arrangement. 

Prior to approaching the market, AEC personnel must: 

Step 1: Search Supply Nation to determine if there is an Indigenous Enterprise that provides the Services 
within the scope of your requirements. 

The  search  (eg.  screen  capture)  for  Indigenous  Enterprises  must  be  saved  to  the Approach to Market 
raised in My procurement. 

Step 2: 

Where a suitable Indigenous Enterprise(s) is identified: 

(a) 

(b) 

If through the initial search suitable Indigenous Enterprise(s) are identified (commensurate to the 
scale, scope and risk of the procurement) the AEC Official must take steps to determine whether the 
Indigenous Enterprise can deliver the required Services through an Approach to Market. 

If an Indigenous Enterprise is identified as representing best value for money through the Approach to 
Market, an Agreement awarded to the Indigenous Enterprise (under Exemption 17 of the 
Commonwealth Procurement Rules). The Commonwealth Contracting Suite (CCS) Contract template 
must be used to enter into an Agreement as outlined at Appendix 13 of these Procedures. 

(c)  All information must be entered into the Approach to Market in My Procurement as outlined at 

Appendix 5 of these Procedures. 

Where no suitable Indigenous Enterprise(s) are identified: 

(d) 

If no suitable Indigenous Enterprise(s) are identified, then normal procurement processes apply 
according to value. 

Tip: Just prior to entering into any Agreement, it is recommended that AEC personnel conduct another 
search of Supply Nation to confirm that the business(es) is still considered an Indigenous Enterprise(s). 

AEC Procurement and Contract Management Procedures 

Page 53 of 90


--- Page 55 ---

Note: The  AEC may use  Exemption  17  of the CPRs  to contract  with  an Indigenous  Enterprise, 
regardless of whether the Indigenous Enterprise is registered with Supply Nation. In these instances, the 
AEC Official must satisfy themselves that the business is at least 50 per cent Indigenous owned and follow 
Step 2 of the process outlined above.

Appendix 4 – Value for Money assessment and Evaluation of Supplier 
Responses 

Value for Money Assessments 

Overview 

The CPRs identify that a thorough consideration of value for money should begin with a clear 
understanding and statement of the goals and purpose of the procurement. When a business requirement 
is identified, AEC personnel should consider if a procurement will deliver the best value for money. This 
consideration should include: 

(a) 

stakeholder input; 

(b) 

the scale and scope of the identified business requirement;  

(c) 

the AEC’s resourcing and budget; 

(d)  obligations and opportunities under other existing Arrangements;  

(e) 

relevant Commonwealth policies; and, 

(f)  

the capacity of the market to competitively respond to a procurement. 

The above items should be used to inform AEC personnel when a procurement represents the best value 
for money, and in considering the most appropriate procurement approach for the activity. It is important 
that this consideration is recorded in writing and maintained with procurement documentation in 
accordance with AEC record keeping requirements. 

Achieving Value for Money 

Achieving Value for Money is the core rule of the Commonwealth Procurement Rules. AEC personnel 
responsible for a procurement (Delegates) must be satisfied, after reasonable enquiries, that the 
procurement achieves a value for money outcome. 

Procurements should: 

(a)  encourage competition within the market and be non-discriminatory; 

(b)  use  public  resources  in  an  efficient,  effective,  economical  and  ethical  manner  that  is  not 

inconsistent with the policies of the Commonwealth; 

(c) 

facilitate accountable and transparent decision making;  

(d)  encourage appropriate engagement with risk; and, 

(e)  be commensurate with the scale and scope of the business requirement. 

When conducting a procurement, an AEC Official must consider the relevant financial and non- financial 
costs and benefits of each submission including, but not limited to; 

(e)  the quality of the goods and services;  
(f)  fitness for purpose of the proposal; 
(g)  the potential supplier’s relevant experience and performance history. 

AEC Procurement and Contract Management Procedures 

Page 55 of 90


--- Page 57 ---

IMPORTANT NOTE: Value for Money Assessments must be comprehensively documented and 
recorded. It is important that you demonstrate to the Delegate that the preferred Supplier represents 
Value for Money for the AEC. 

Scenario: What if only one quote is received? How can I demonstrate Value for Money? 

As outlined above, there are various aspects that should be considered in evaluating Value for 
Money. 

This includes: the quality of the goods and services; fitness for purpose of the proposal; the 
Supplier’s experience and performance history. 

When you are evaluating a procurement that has only received one response, you may also wish to 
consider: benchmarking; looking at pricing/Services in other Commonwealth Agency panel rates; or 
utilising consultants that have industry expertise. 

Value for Money Assessment is required for all procurement activities, regardless of the value or the 
procurement approach. A Value for Money Assessment must also be completed when taking any 
extension option to an existing contract to ensure the Delegate can be satisfied that extending the 
arrangement continues to deliver a value for money outcome to the AEC. 

Evaluation 

Please note: For all open tender procurements; Limited Tender procurements valued at $80 000 and 
above; and, procurements valued at $200 000 and above through Existing Arrangements, a 
formal evaluation plan and evaluation report are required. 

In order to ensure probity is maintained throughout your procurement process, you must ensure that 
your Evaluation Plan is developed, consulted, and approved by the Delegate as soon as possible in 
the procurement process. Ideally, this would be completed prior to approaching the market/suppliers, 
which would also provide the opportunity to confirm that clear evaluation criteria has been included 
in the approach to supplier. At a minimum, Evaluation Reports must be approved by the Delegate 
prior to the closing date of responses from potential suppliers. 

Once the response period has passed, Submissions can be accessed and must be evaluated by the 
evaluation in accordance with the approved Evaluation Plan. 

The evaluation must be commensurate with the scale and scope of the procurement, and be sufficient 
enough to satisfy the Delegate that Value for Money can be demonstrated. 

Tip: A single AEC Official can evaluate the Submissions for procurements valued under $10 000.

Appendix 5 – My Procurement, Record Keeping and AusTender 
Reporting 

My Procurement (including My Contracts) 

Overview 

My Procurement and My Contracts are central access modules located within the AEC Procure-to-pay 
System: My Procurement (My procurement). They support best practice procurement processes and 
contract management in the AEC. 

My Procurement must be used by AEC Officials to record all procurement activities, with the exception of 
low value procurements being paid for with an AEC Corporate Credit Card, from the initial procurement 
planning stage through to executing the final Agreement.  

Once all stages have been completed in My Procurement, a contract will be created in My Contracts.     

My Contracts must  be  updated  throughout  the  life  of  the  Agreement,  including to  record  any 
variations or extensions. 

Access 

My Procurement and My Contracts can be accessed at: 

User Guide 

A   step-by-step   guide   on   how   to   use   My Procurement is available: [Link to be inserted]. 

Record Keeping and Reporting 

Overview 

AEC personnel are responsible for ensuring that every procurement process is open and transparent, and 
that  decisions  can  be  publicly  justified.  This  section  details  the  AEC’s  record  keeping  and 
procurement reporting requirements, and should be used as a guide to AEC personnel to inform them of 
their responsibilities when conducting a procurement. 

AEC personnel should contact Commercial Law and Procurement for further advice on their individual 
reporting obligations. Include reporting on Austender. 

Record Keeping 

AEC personnel  must use  appropriate  templates,  and  follow AEC  Recordkeeping policy.  As an 
example, once a procurement process is concluded, AEC personnel must file all documents (executed 
Agreements, invoices etc) on a corporate file to provide a record of procurement activity and how the 
process has been conducted. 

In order to ensure we meet our obligations under the CPR’s (Section 7.2-7.4) documentation should 
provide accurate information on 

(a) 

the requirement for the procurement; 

(b) 

the procurement process that was followed; 

(c) 

any business decisions that influenced the selection of the procurement process (e.g. why a panel 
was approached in place of an open tender procurement); 

(d)  how value of money was considered and achieved; 

(e) 

relevant approvals; and 

(f) 

relevant decisions and the basis of those decisions. 

AEC Procurement and Contract Management Procedures

You must ensure that appropriate security classifications are listed on all documentation. It is anticipated 
that most procurement and contractual documentation should be classified as For Official Use Only given 
the documents will likely include commercially sensitive information. 

Please Note: My Procurement is not a record management system and you are required to maintain 
records and appropriate files. 

AEC personnel should contact AEC records management area for assistance, if required. 

AusTender 

AusTender is the Commonwealths procurement information system. It is the central point for mandatory 
publication of all publicly available Commonwealth Government (AEC) business opportunities for: 

(a)  publishing of all publicly available Approaches To Market, Annual Procurement Plans, panel 

arrangements and Agreements awarded; 

(b)  electronic distribution of documentation and addenda for Approaches To Market; and 

(c) 

a secure lodgement for Submissions. 

AusTender provides the following benefits to suppliers: 

(a)  one central point to find publicly available business opportunities and planned procurements 

advertised by the Commonwealth; 

(b)  automatic notification of business opportunities;  

(c) 

automatic notification of addenda; 

(d)  electronic lodgement of Submissions into a secure electronic tender box;  

(e)  access 24 hours a day 7 days a week; 

(f) 

reduced costs, by eliminating the need to print, bind and courier Submissions; and  

(g)  online access to information about panel arrangements and Agreements awarded.  

Reporting 

The Australian Government is required to make its procurement activities visible and transparent to the 
public. The AEC has the following obligations in regards to the reporting of Agreements: 

(a)  all  Agreements  with  a  value  of  $10  000  or  more  must  be  published  on AusTender within 42 

days of entering into the Agreement; 

(b)  all  amendments  (including  extensions)  to  Agreements  of  $10 000  must  be published on

Appendix 6 – Responsibilities of AEC Financial Delegates 

Overview 

AEC personnel must not enter into Agreements unless the appropriate approvals and authorisations have 
been given in accordance with the PGPA Act and Rules. 

AEC personnel must ensure that the following powers under the PGPA Act are exercised by AEC 
personnel with the correct financial delegation. These are the powers to: 

(a) 

commit public money (s 23(3) PGPA Act) and then record that approval under PGPA Rule 

18, including the commitment of future year expenditure if required; 

(b)  enter into and vary an arrangement (s 23(1) PGPA Act), such as a contract; and 

(c) 

grant an indemnity, guarantee or warranty (s 60 PGPA Act). 

Responsibilities of all AEC Financial Delegates 

AEC Financial Delegates must only purport to exercise a power in accordance with:  

(a) 

their  Financial Delegation; 

(b) 

the AEC’s AAIs; and 

(c) 

lawful direction given from time to time in relation to the exercise of that power. 

Financial Delegations Schedule 

Only a select number of AEC personnel hold a financial delegation, as set out in the  Financial Delegations 
Schedule administered by Finance and Business Services Branch. 

s23(3) power to commit public money 

In exercising this power, the AEC Financial Delegates must: 

(a)     take all reasonable steps (including by seeking advice from specialists) to ensure that they are 

sufficiently and appropriately informed  on  the  matters  that  must  be  considered  when exercising  
their   delegation; 

(b)     be satisfied that sufficient funds are available within the relevant budget to support all proposed 

payments under the Agreement, costings are sound accurate; 

(c)     be satisfied that the commitment of relevant money would be a proper use and management of 

public resources (ie. efficient, effective, economical and ethical); 

(d)     be satisfied that the benefits of entering into the arrangement outweigh the risk of locking away 
future budget flexibility if a commitment of relevant money spans multiple financial years); 

(e)     perform functions and discharge duties with the degree of care and diligence that a reasonable 

person would exercise; 

(f)      perform functions and discharge duties honestly, in good faith and for a proper purpose; 

(g)     not improperly use their position; 

(h)     not gain, or seek to gain, a benefit or an advantage for themselves or any other person; 

(i)      not cause, or seek to cause, detriment to the entity, the Commonwealth or any other person;  

(j)      disclose details of any material personal interest that relates to the commitment of relevant money; 

(k)     make reasonable inquiries to ensure this procurement activity meets all required procurement 

obligations; 

(l)      consider a supplier’s political activity (if any) to determine if there are any risks to the AEC’s actual or 
perceived political neutrality associated with the supplier’s political activities, and if so, whether those 
risks can be mitigated; and 

AEC Procurement and Contract Management Procedures 

Page 60 of 90


--- Page 62 ---

(m)    record the approval in writing as soon as practicable after giving it. 

Further guidance for AEC Financial Delegates approving commitments of relevant money is available in 
RMG-400. 

s23(1) power to enter into and vary arrangements 

AEC Financial Delegates must not exercise his or her delegation to enter into an arrangement unless: 

(a)     the arrangement has been approved by the AEC Financial Delegate under Section 23(3) of the PGPA 

Act; and 

(b)     the value of the arrangement does not exceed the amount approved. 

s60 power to grant an indemnity, guarantee or warranty 

In exercising his or her powers to grant a contingent liability, AEC Financial Delegates must first seek legal 
advice from CLP. Further guidance on this issue is provided in RMG-414. 

Process 

Approval for commitments valued under $10 000 being paid for on AEC Corporate Credit 
Card 

Approvals for procurements valued under $10 000 that are being paid for on an AEC Corporate Credit 
must be obtained in writing. A template for seeking approvals for procurements valued under $10 000 is 
available at Procurement procedures and templates. 

Where the arrangement requires the grant of an indemnity, guarantee or warranty by the AEC, legal 
advice from CLP must be obtained. The approval may be obtained from the AEC Financial Delegate in 
writing (including by email). Once the arrangement is entered into, records must be provided to CLP. 

Approval for commitments all values 

For all procurements no matter the value (excluding those valued under $10,000 and being paid by 
AEC Corporate Credit Card), approvals must be obtained through My Procurement. 

Once an AEC Official submits an Approach to Market in My Procurement, CLP will review and workflow to 
the AEC Financial Delegate nominated by the requesting AEC Official. The AEC Financial Delegate will 
receive an automated email to consider the request for approval and a link to the Approach to Market in 
My Procurement. 

Where an arrangement requires the grant of an indemnity, guarantee or warranty by the AEC, this must be 
stated in the Approach to Market in My Procurement and legal advice from CLP must be obtained. Where 
it is so stated, the Approach to Market in My Procurement will workflow to the AEC Financial Delegate 
nominated by the requesting AEC Official to grant the indemnity, guarantee or warranty to consider the 
request for approval. The AEC Financial Delegate will receive an automated email to consider the request 
for approval and a link to the Approach to Market in My Procurement. 

Entry into an arrangement of any value 

To enter into an arrangement usually means signing an agreement. For arrangements where a written 
agreement is not required (usually low risk arrangements valued under $10 000), payment or confirmation 
to proceed (whether written or verbal) may suffice. 

To maintain transparency in the exercise of powers, it is important to have written evidence of an 
arrangement, rather than rely on verbal confirmation. 

To reduce the AEC’s exposure to fraud, the separation of duties is important. It is therefore best practice 
for the powers to approve and enter to be exercised by different AEC Financial Delegates.

Appendix 7 – Confidentiality and Unfair Contract Terms 

Confidentiality 

Overview 

The Commonwealth’s confidentiality interests must be appropriately protected and managed in accordance 
with any relevant legislation, the Commonwealth Procurement Rules, relevant guidance  published  by  the 
Department of Finance, and confidentiality provisions in an Agreement. 

Confidentiality throughout the procurement process 

Planning 

When planning a procurement, AEC personnel should consider the nature of the procurement and whether 
it is likely to raise confidentiality issues for the Commonwealth. Such issues can arise in a number of ways 
including where: 

(a)     potential Suppliers require access to confidential information in order to lodge a Submission;  

(b)      Suppliers  require  access  to  confidential  information  in  order  to  fulfil  the  requirements  of  the 

Agreement; or 

(c)     the information generated as a result of performing the Services is confidential. 

Approaching the Market 

Request  documentation,  including  any  draft  Agreement,  should  reflect  the  AEC’s  requirements  for 
confidentiality as assessed during the procurement planning process. 

Evaluating 

AEC personnel must ensure all Submissions are treated as confidential for the duration of the procurement 
process and after the award of the Agreement. Where appropriate, ensure assessments include the ability 
to meet confidentiality obligations. 

Awarding an Agreement 

There are two broad types of confidentiality clauses used in Agreements: 

(a)     general confidentiality clauses such as legislative obligations under the Privacy Act 1988 or how to 

deal with confidential information between the parties; and 

(b)     specific confidentiality clauses which protect the confidentiality of all or part of the Agreement itself 

or information obtained or generated in performing the Services. 

The  need  to  maintain  the  confidentiality  of  information  should  always  be  balanced  against  the  public 
accountability and transparency requirements of the Australian Government. 

If a Supplier has requested that any part/s of an agreement be treated as confidential, the AEC must assess 
the request against the criteria that comprise the Department of Finance’s ‘Confidentiality  

Test’. This test includes four (4) criteria that all must be met for a Supplier’s commercial information to be 
considered confidential by the AEC.  

Suppliers  will  often  request  that  information  be  kept  confidential  even  where  it  is  unlikely  to  satisfy  the 
Confidentiality  Test  (such  as  pricing  information).  It  is  strongly  recommended  that  you  not  accept  such 
requests, or that you negotiate with a Supplier to amend their request so that it satisfies the Confidentiality 
Test. If you decide to accept such a request, you must record the reasons behind your decision, including 
the justification of how the request meets each of the four criteria in the Confidentiality Test.  

Confidentiality Test Criteria are outlined below:

Unfair Contract Terms 

Where the AEC is carrying on a business (for example, providing fee for service elections) and enters into a 
standard form contract with a small business (i.e. a business with less than 20 employees) where: 

(a) 

(for contracts for 12 months or shorter) the value of the contract is less than $300 000; or 

(b) 

(for contracts over 12 months) the value of the contract is less than $1 million, 

any provision in that contract that is unfair can be declared by a court to be void, as if that provision had 
never existed. 

An unfair contract term is a term in a standard form contract that: 

(a)     causes a significant imbalance between the parties, 

(b)     is not reasonably necessary to protect the business’s interests, and 

(c)     causes detriment to the small business, in the context of the entirety of the contract. 

Action 

Where the AEC is carrying on a business and enters into a contract with a small business, make sure 
that the wording of the template that your contract uses has been reviewed by CLP. 

Even where the AEC is not carrying on a business, always make sure that the contract you use is: 

(a)  a standard Commonwealth or AEC template contract provided by CLP; or 

(b)  where the supplier’s terms and conditions are used, that legal advice on the terms and conditions 

have been obtained from CLP. 

If you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to obtain advice from CLP. 

Complaints and Disputes 

Overview 

Paragraph 6.8 of the CPRs require that: 

If a complaint about procurement is received, relevant entities must apply timely, equitable and non-
discriminatory complaint-handling procedures, including providing acknowledgement soon after the 
complaint has been received. Relevant entities should aim to manage the complaint process internally, 
when possible, through communication and conciliation. 

Complaints 

Any general complaints that arise during a procurement process, for example complaints about an AEC 
Official’s  conduct,  must  be  managed  in  accordance  with  the AEC  Complaints  Management Framework. 

Disputes 

If a Respondent disputes the conduct of a procurement, or its outcome, the disputed matter should be 
made in writing to the AEC Official nominated in the procurement documentation. CLP must be immediately 
notified of any likely or actual dispute, so that assistance can be provided. 

The AEC will at first instance respond to the Respondent, in writing, and seek to resolve the disputed matter 
between  the  parties  through  communication.  If  the  dispute  cannot  be  resolved  within  30 

Business Days, then the matter will be escalated to the Chief Legal Officer (CLO) for consideration and 
internal legal review by the CLO or his delegate (if required). 

Should an internal legal review be required, at the conclusion of the review the Respondent will be provided 
with a written decision, including reasons for the decision. 

AEC Procurement and Contract Management Procedures 

Page 65 of 90


--- Page 67 ---

Despite the above process, a Respondent may, at any time, seek external review of the dispute matter. 
Depending on the nature of the dispute, the dispute may be externally reviewed by the: 

(a)     Commonwealth Ombudsman; 

(b)     Procurement Coordinator, Department of Finance; or 

(c)     court system.

Appendix 8 – Ethics and Probity 
Overview 

Probity is the evidence of ethical behaviour, and can be defined as complete and confirmed integrity, 
uprightness and honesty in a particular process. 

Probity   covers   the   core   values   for   achieving   value   for   money   and   non-discrimination   in 
Commonwealth procurement, and must be integrated into every procurement process. 

Principles 
The principles underpinning ethics and probity in Commonwealth Procurement are: 

(a)     Officials must act ethically, in accordance with the APS Values and Code of Conduct, as set out 

in the Public Service Act 1999, at all times in undertaking any procurement. 

(b)     Officials must not make improper use of their position. 

(c)     Officials should avoid placing themselves in a position where there is the potential for claims of 

bias. 

(d)     Officials must not accept hospitality, gifts or benefits from any potential suppliers. 

(e)     Agencies must not seek to benefit from supplier practices that may be dishonest, unethical or 

unsafe. 

(f) 

All tenderers must be treated equitably.  This means that all tenderers must be treated fairly - it 
does not necessarily mean that they are treated equally. 

(g)     Conflicts of interest must be managed appropriately. 

(h)     Probity   and   conflict   of   interest   requirements   should   be   applied   with   appropriate   and 

proportionate measures informed by sound risk management principles. 

(i)      Value for money outcomes are best served by effective probity measures that do not exclude 

suppliers from consideration for inconsequential reasons. 

(j)      Confidential information must be treated appropriately during and after a procurement process. 

(k)     External  probity  specialists  should  only  be  appointed  where  justified  by  the  nature  of  the 

procurement. 

Applying probity in procurement 

Probity provides a level of assurance to AEC Financial Delegates, Suppliers and the Commonwealth that 
a procurement was conducted in a manner that is fair, equitable and defensible. 

Fairness and impartiality 

As a minimum, AEC personnel must ensure that: 

(a)     each  Potential  Supplier  has  equal  access  to  the  same  material,  including  any  information 

shared through communications with other Potential Suppliers; 

(b)     any  market  research  activities  or  discussions  do  not  provide  an  advantage  to  Potential 

Supplier; 

(c)     the  Request  Documentation  clearly  details  the  conditions  for  participation  and  evaluation 

criteria, and is equally available to all Potential Suppliers; 

(d)     AEC personnel involved in the evaluation are not responsible for approving the expenditure; 

(e)     potential tenderers are evaluated on their capability of obtaining, if selected as the preferred 

tenderer, any relevant Australian Standards, certifications, licences or professional accreditations, 
not whether they have the certification at the time of tendering, 

(f)     site visits, where relevant, are offered to all Potential Suppliers and should be of similar duration; 

AEC Procurement and Contract Management Procedures 

Page 67 of 90


--- Page 69 ---

(g)    Request Documentation directs Potential Suppliers to a single nominated AEC Official to respond 

to queries; 

(h)     all unnecessary contact with Potential Suppliers is avoided; and 

(i)      there is no Conflict of Interest or bias towards a particular Respondent. 

Competitive process 

The procurement method selected should aim to ensure that the cost of responding does not deter 
competent Potential Suppliers, and achieves value for money for the Commonwealth. 

Reasonable timeframes should be set for any procurement process to enable Potential Suppliers to 
confidently allocate resources to their Submissions. 

Probity Briefing 

A Probity Advisor is required to be assigned to the following procurements; 

(a)  Procurements from Existing Arrangements valued at or above $200 000*. 

(b)  Open Tender procurements of any value. 

(c) 

Limited Tender procurements above the procurement threshold ($80 000). 

*Note that CLP will determine for each procurement if a Probity Advisor is required.  

The Probity Advisor assigned to the procurement activity will provide a probity briefing to the Evaluation 
Team. This briefing should ideally occur before the Request for Quote/Tender (RFQ/RFT) is issued to the 
market, but must occur no later than before the closing date. The draft Evaluation Plan should be 
provided to the Probity Advisor, with the expectation that the Evaluation Plan be finalised following the 
probity briefing. 

Conflicts of interest 

AEC personnel and external advisers should avoid any conduct that has the potential to increase the risk 
of integrity issues being raised as a matter of public concern. 

AEC personnel must declare whether they have any Conflict of Interest at the commencement of a 
procurement process, and update it should circumstances change throughout the entire procurement 
process, particularly as Respondents are known later in the process. Any Conflict of Interest should be 
reported to the relevant AEC Financial Delegate for direction on how it should be managed or resolved. 

AEC personnel should use the Conflict of Interest declaration for this purpose; external advisers should 
use the conflict of interest and confidentiality undertaking attached to the Evaluation and Probity Plan. 

Gifts and hospitality 

Any AEC Official involved in a procurement process must not seek or accept any gifts, hospitality or any 
other benefits, including offers of employment, from any Potential Supplier. The AEC Financial Delegate 
or chair of an evaluation team must be informed immediately if this occurs. 

Security and confidentiality 

AEC personnel must put measures in place to manage the security and confidentiality of all 
documentation related to a procurement process in accordance with the Protective Security Policy 
Framework. 

Communications 

If queries or requests for clarification are received from Potential Suppliers for further information or a 
modification to the Request Documentation is required, all Potential Suppliers must be notified at the 
same time. The notification must be provided in the same method as the original Request 
Documentation: 

AEC Procurement and Contract Management Procedures 

Page 68 of 90


--- Page 70 ---

(a)     AusTender - the Addendum template should be drafted and submitted to CLP for review and 

publishing; or 

(b)     Email – all Potential Suppliers must be blind copied. 

Where any question or request is received, this must be included and ‘de-identified’ in the response to all 
Potential Suppliers. 

AEC personnel may need to consider that an extension to the Submission deadline may be necessary 
depending on any modifications made to Request Documentation. 

Industry briefings 

Depending on the value, complexity, risk and types of Services being procured, an industry briefing can 
provide an opportunity for Potential Suppliers to learn more about the AEC’s requirements and for 
Potential Suppliers to ask questions. AEC personnel should provide consistent information when briefing 
Potential Suppliers, and any questions and answers at briefing sessions should be communicated to all 
Potential Suppliers in writing following the industry briefing. 

Requests for extensions 

Requests for extensions can be a difficult issue, primarily due to the deadlines in maintaining the 
integrity and probity of the procurement process. To ensure fairness and impartiality to all Potential 
Suppliers, if a request for extension is accepted then all Potential Suppliers need to receive the same 
extension. 

Decisions on extensions need to be made with due care and consideration as a refused requires may 
exclude the best Respondent or place a Respondent at a disadvantage. Extensions cannot be given 
once the deadline for Submissions has passed.  

Receipt and opening of Submissions 

Submissions must not be opened until: 

(a)     the deadline for Submission has passed;  

(b)     the evaluation plan is completed; and 

(c)     all AEC personnel have declared any Conflicts of Interest. 

Late Submissions 

Submissions received after the deadline must not be accepted unless due to mishandling by the AEC. 
Any late Submissions should be returned unopened, unless they must be opened to determine the return 
address. 

Shortlisting 

Where an AEC Official intends to shortlist Submissions received at any stage of the evaluation, it is 
imperative that this process be clearly outlined in the Request Documentation and evaluation plan. 

The reasons for excluding a Submission from further evaluation must be defensible, properly 
documented, and agreed by the Delegate. The final Evaluation Report must include reasons for 
shortlisting. 

Interviews and presentations 

The AEC may request Respondents to attend an interview or to provide a presentation on their 
Submission. If only shortlisted Respondents will be invited, it is best practice that this is specified in the 
Request Documentation. 

All Respondents will need to be given the same amount of notice to prepare, and all 
presentations/interviews should be of similar duration. All Respondents must be advised that while a 

AEC Procurement and Contract Management Procedures 

Page 69 of 90


--- Page 71 ---

presentation/ interview is an opportunity to highlight aspects of their Submission, it is not an opportunity 
to revise or alter their Submission. 

Clarification requests 

After the initial analysis of Submissions, AEC personnel may need to seek clarification from 
Respondents on errors of form in a submission, such as technical omissions, ambiguities and 
anomalies. Where clarification is required, all communication with Respondents must be undertaken in 
writing. It is integral that requests for clarification do not allow a Respondent to revise or modify their 
Submission in any substantive way.  

Compliance Statements 

Submissions must state whether it complies with each clause of the Request Documentation and 

Contract for the AEC to consider during evaluation of the level of risk. 

As a general principle, the party best placed to manage risks should bear those risks, that is, the AEC 
should generally not accept risks which a Supplier is better placed to manage. Similarly, where the AEC is 
best-placed to manage a particular risk, it should not seek to inappropriately transfer that risk to a 
Supplier. 

Before accepting a non-compliance, AEC personnel must first seek the advice from CLP. 

Conduct financial viability assessment 

Financial viability assessments are undertaken on all Potential Tenderers that have submitted a 
response to an approach to market on AusTender. However, depending on the value, complexity, risk 
and types of Services being procured, a full financial viability assessment may likely need to be 
arrangement by the Tender Evaluation Team through the Financial Services Section. This would assist 
in reducing the risk that a Respondent may not be able to: 

(a)     deliver the Services as specified in the Agreement; or 

(b)     fulfil any guarantees or warranties provided for in the Agreement. 

Negotiations 

In some instances, it may be appropriate for AEC personnel to negotiate with the Supplier/s to finalise the 
details of their offer and the resultant Agreement. 

Generally, negotiations will focus on the identified areas of non-compliance with the draft Agreement. AEC 
personnel should be mindful that the scope of requirements should not be part of negotiations, and the 
negotiation stage is not an opportunity for the Suppliers to substantially amend their submission. 

Develop a negotiation strategy 

Negotiations are more likely to be successful when planning includes: 

(a)     identification of the Agreement’s terms and conditions that will be subject to negotiation;  

(b)     establishing the roles and responsibilities of the negotiating team; 

(c)     identifying any problems or barriers which may affect the Supplier performing its role, as well as 

opportunities, and developing an approach to address these; 

(d)     defining the objectives and constraints of the negotiation; and 

(e)     involving  senior  management  in  setting  the  policy parameters  and communicating  progress 

and/or changes in circumstances to them. 

Formal  negotiation  protocols  should  be  established  where  AEC  Officials  are  negotiating  with 
shortlisted Respondents prior to selecting the Supplier, or where negotiations are being conducted with a 
number of Respondents in order to establish a panel arrangement. 

AEC Procurement and Contract Management Procedures 

Page 70 of 90


--- Page 72 ---

Assign roles and responsibilities 

AEC personnel must ensure that the parties involved understand their responsibilities and the other 
various tasks required to negotiate and formalise the Agreement. 

When   negotiating   Agreements   identified   as   complex,   high   value   and/or   high   risk,   a   CLP 

representative must be involved in the negotiation process from the outset. An AEC Official can be 
appointed lead negotiator. 

The negotiation team should have an understanding of the: 

(a)     the AEC’s requirements; 

(b)     basis on which the Supplier/s has been selected; 

(c)     background to why certain terms and conditions are subject to negotiation (often these are as a 

result of the evaluation of submissions); and 

(d)     include the Contract Manager details. 

Conduct negotiations 

It is important that negotiations are conducted in a professional and structured manner. Addressing the 
following issues will assist in achieving this objective: 

(a)     agreeing the location and agenda for each negotiating session; 

(b)  obtaining sign-off on the negotiation arrangements with the Probity Adviser; 

(c) 

establishing  timeframes  in  which  negotiations  of  individual  issues,  as  well  as  negotiations 
overall, will be conducted; 

(d)  establishing any interrelationships between individual issues/provisions that are subject to 

negotiation to ensure these are taken into account during negotiations. For example, there will 
generally be a relationship between service levels and pricing; 

(e) 

(f) 

focussing on achieving the objective sought over the life of the Agreement, rather than on short term 
gains; 

keeping issues that are not negotiable to a minimum and being prepared to trade-off less important 
requirements to achieve outcomes that are central to the AEC’s objectives; and 

(g)     assigning responsibility for taking formal minutes of the negotiations and ensuring minutes are 

circulated and agreed within specified timeframes. 

During negotiations AEC personnel must avoid any suggestion that a Supplier/s is certain to be awarded 
the Agreement because this could imply a commitment by the AEC, and can undermine the 
effectiveness of the negotiations. 

Debriefs 

Debriefs must be conducted individually and in a professional manner and must focus on the 
Respondent’s performance against the evaluation criteria in the Request Documentation. It is important 
not to address any matters not covered by the evaluation criteria. 

AEC personnel should plan all debriefs carefully. The confidence of the Respondents in the procurement 
process is likely to increase if the debriefing demonstrates that the procurement decision was the result 
of a fair and considered decision-making process. 

Topics covered in debriefings may include: 

(a)     project methodology and/or design issues; 

(b)     organisation, management and administration;  

AEC Procurement and Contract Management Procedures 

Page 71 of 90


--- Page 73 ---

(c)     price; 

(d)     nominated personnel including the experience and quality of operational, management and other 

personnel; 

(e)     experience of the Respondent generally;  

(f)      work schedule issues; 

(g)     vagueness or unacceptability on delivery dates if important to the decision; 

(h)     facilities and equipment if inappropriate, inefficient or out-dated, or if they would increase costs or 

affect timeframes; 

(i)      subcontracting the arrangements where inappropriate or inefficient, including where the proposed 

subcontractor lacked necessary qualifications or experience, or if a proper control system was 
lacking; 

(j)      industrial relations and/or work health and safety issues; 

(k)     failure to comply with government policies or requirements; 

(l)      quality management issues (such as inadequate quality assurance certification or other control 

methods, or systems people and training); and 

(m)    support, warranty or after sales service issues. 

In all cases, AEC personnel should inform Respondents that the debrief will only include discussion of 
their Submission. AEC personnel must not discuss other Respondents. 

Probity Advisers 

AEC personnel can best manage probity risks by conducting a risk assessment in the planning stage of 
the procurement. 

A Probity Adviser can provide advice as requested before and during the course of the procurement 
process.  Appropriate  probity  advice  will  ensure  that  the  procurement  process  complies  with 
legislation,   policies,   these   Procedures   and   the   evaluation   process   described   in   Request 
Documentation and evaluation plan. 

AEC personnel must appoint a Probity Adviser for all open tender procurements, and CLP will determine 
if a Probity Adviser is required for Panel or Limited Tender procurements with a value over $200 000. 
CLP has capacity to provide probity advice, and in certain circumstances CLP may recommend that a 
Probity Adviser external to the AEC be appointed.

Appendix 9 – Political Neutrality  

Political Neutrality 

Overview 

The AEC operates in a politically sensitive environment. Any person engaged by the AEC (inclusive of 
Suppliers) who is, and is seen to be, active in political affairs, and intends to publicly carry on this activity, 
may  compromise  the  strict  political  neutrality  of  the  AEC.  The  AEC’s  Political  Neutrality Policy 
establishes the principles that underpin the political neutrality requirements. 

Managing political neutrality for procurements 

AEC personnel must ensure that: 

(a)  Suppliers and Potential Suppliers complete political neutrality declarations within the AEC 

procurement templates; and/or 

(b)  when  using  an  Existing  Arrangement,  the  Agreement  incorporates  the  AEC’s  political neutrality 

requirements. 

AEC Financial Delegates must: 

(c) 

consider a Supplier’s political activity (if any) to determine if there are any risks associated with the 
Supplier’s political activities before providing any approval; and  

(d) 

if risks are identified, whether those risks can be mitigated. 

Funding disclosure checks 

All new procurements entered into My Procurement will have the Supplier’s (including any approved 
subcontractors) ‘political activity’ for the last three (3) financial years searched using existing Funding and 
Disclosure Branch’s (FAD) systems. 

The results of this search will be identified in the automated email to the AEC Financial Delegate following 
approval of the Spending Proposal by CLP, with detail of any identified activities attached to the Approach 
to Market in My Procurement. If any political activities are identified, CLP offers the following matters for 
consideration by the AEC Financial Delegate: 

(a)     Does  the  Supplier’s  political  activity  conflict  with  their  ability  to  provide  the  Services  to  the AEC? 

(b)     Is  there  a  real  or  perceived  risk  (to  the  AEC’s  political  neutrality)  if  we  proceeded  with  this Supplier 

and can this risk be mitigated by implementing control measures? 

(c)     Should  the  approval  be  granted  on  a  conditional  basis  (ie.  the  Supplier  must  implement 

identified control measures)? 

CLP will not request political activity searches if: 

(a)     the Supplier is a Commonwealth agency (eg. Services Australia);  

(b)     the spending value is less than $10 000; or 

(c)     a search for that legal entity has already been completed in the last 6 months. 

Managing political neutrality for contracting 

The AEC contracting templates include provisions to encompass AEC political neutrality requirements of 
Suppliers. AEC personnel may require Deed Polls (that incorporate these requirements) to be completed by 
specific Service Provider personnel in some circumstances. This may include 

(a)  where the AEC requires Service Provider’s Advisors, Specified Personnel  or other third parties to 

provide specific undertakings;

(b)  where a party discloses Confidential Information; 

(c)  where Personnel of the Service Provider is to be given Personal Information; or, 

(d)  where  the  AEC  requires  political  neutrality  undertakings  from  a  specific  Service  Provider 

Personnel. 

Signed Deed Polls must be attached to the relevant Approach to Market in My Procurement. 

Before any Agreement is extended or varied, a funding disclosure check (if the check is older than 6 
months) will be conducted using existing FAD systems as part of the value for money assessment. 

Appendix 10 – Consultancies 

Overview 

The AEC is required to report if an Agreement has been entered into for the provision of consultancy 
services on both AusTender and the AEC’s Annual Report. 

Consultancy services are required for one of the following reasons: 

(a)     the need for independent research or assessment; 

(b)     the need for specialised or professional skills, or 

(c)     the skills are currently unavailable within the AEC. 

Process 

When determining whether a procurement is a consultancy AEC personnel should consider whether the: 

(a)     Services involve the development of an intellectual output that assists with decision making (eg. 
outputs might include the expression of an original concept, research, findings, analysis, advice 
and/or recommendations); 

(b)     output will reflect the independent views of the supplier (eg. if the output is being produced for the 
AEC it is likely to be a consultancy and if it is being produced on behalf of the AEC it is not likely to 
be a consultancy); and 

(c)     output  is  the  sole  or  majority  element  of  the  Agreement,  in  terms  of  relative  value  and 

importance. 

If all of these criteria are satisfied, then the Agreement must be reported as a consultancy. 

Some Agreements will exhibit different outputs which are consistent with both consultancy and non- 
consultancy services. In these cases AEC personnel should consider the value and relative importance of 
the consultancy when deciding whether to report the Agreement as a consultancy. 

When raising a Procurement Plan in My Procurement AEC personnel must identify whether the planned 
procurement is a consultancy or not and the reason. 

Flowchart 

The  following  flowchart  may  assist  AEC  Officials  to  identify  whether  their  procurement  is  a 
consultancy:

Appendix 11 – Contingent Liabilities 

Overview 

This Appendix provides guidance on entering into an arrangement that requires the AEC to grant an 
indemnity, guarantee, or warranty. This is generally referred to as entering into an arrangement that gives 
rise to contingent liabilities. 

What are contingent liabilities? 

Contingent liabilities are legally enforceable obligations that give rise to a liability on the occurrence of a 
future event. Once a party enters into an arrangement that obliges that party to take on contingent liabilities, 
the party has undertaken to accept obligations that ordinarily fall with others. RMG-414 provides detailed 
guidance on different arrangements that may give rise to contingent liabilities. 

Contingent liabilities can be difficult to identify. However, they are not present in contractual documentation 
that are standard Commonwealth contracts, such as: 

(a) 

contracts that use the Commonwealth Contracting Suite terms and conditions; or 

(b) 

contracts that use the AEC’s standard template terms and conditions obtained from CLP. 

Therefore, whenever AEC personnel are requested by suppliers to accept contractual terms and conditions 
that are not standard Commonwealth or AEC contracts, legal advice from CLP must be sought to identify 
whether accepting the supplier’s preferred contractual terms and conditions would hold the AEC to 
contingent liabilities. 

Controls 

The PGPA Act allows AEC personnel with the appropriate level of delegation under s 60 of that Act to enter 
into an arrangement that gives rise to contingent liabilities on behalf of the Commonwealth. Details on these 
delegations are stated in the  Financial Delegations Schedule. By exercising this power, the AEC delegate is 
ultimately agreeing, on behalf of the Commonwealth, to accept particular risks (often a greater level of risk) 
so that the other party will bear less risk. 

The AEC delegate can only exercise this power where a risk assessment concludes that: 

(c) 

the likelihood of an event occurring that exposes the AEC to contingent liability are remote(i.e. less 
than 5%); and 

(d) 

the probable expenditure would not be significant (i.e. less than $30 million). 

Further, the AEC’s Comcover insurance normally will not pay where the most probable expenditure that 
would need to be made if the event giving rise to the liability occurred is over $5 million. Therefore, AEC 
personnel must inform CLP if the risk assessment concludes that the estimated financial loss is over $5 
million but less than $30 million, so that CLP can notify Comcover.

Appendix 12 – AEC Escalation Framework 

AEC Escalation Framework 

Overview 

At times a Contract Manager may require approval or decisions to be made by the AEC that are above 
their level of authority, or may require assistance in managing an issue with a Supplier. At these times, 
escalation may be required within the AEC. 

The AEC Escalation Framework is designed to assist Contract Managers in identifying the escalation 
process applicable to their contract, and prompt the development of communication channels with end 
users and identified escalation points to assist in effective management of the contract. The Stepped 
Escalation Diagram and worked scenarios (intended to demonstrate how and when issues may need to be 
escalated – and to what level) should assist Contract Managers in identifying their escalation process 
applicable to their contract. This must be recorded in the Contract Management Plan. 

If Escalating? 

As a Contract Manager, if you are required to escalate any issue/decision you must first identify the 
correct escalation points for your contract using the AEC Contract Management – Stepped Escalation 
Process as a guide (see following page). 

You should also ensure that you have made all attempts to resolve issues at the lowest possible level 
before escalating – utilising the relationship that you have built with your Supplier. 

If you are escalating an issue you must ensure that you provide the escalation point (e.g. Delegate, Panel 
Manager) with: 

(a)  a complete and comprehensive explanation of the situation; 

(b)  a summary of the issue; 

(c)  AEC instructions / involvement to date; 

(d)  all discussions/correspondence to date; 

(e)  a clear timeframe of events; and, 

(f)  what you require assistance with (e.g. decision / negotiate with Supplier. 

An escalation point can only act on the information with which they are provided, and it is important that 
they are fully informed.

Stepped Escalation Process – Contract Scenarios 

Scenario 1: Furniture Hire Contract 

Scenario: A Service Provider is contracted to provide furniture to the AEC at a number of venues 
(including OPCs, PPVCs and PPs), through a Work Order issued under the AEC Panel for Furniture and 
Equipment Hire and managed by State Office. At one venue the AEC representative notices that some of 
the tables delivered are damaged and unsuitable for use. The AEC representative identifies that 
replacement tables are required within a certain timeframe in order for the AEC to effectively conduct its 
business. 

Resolution and escalation: The AEC representative should not accept the unsuitable furniture, and 
should discuss the issue with their contact at the Service Provider to attempt to receive replacement 
furniture. The AEC representative should report the matter through the appropriate communication 
channel to the AEC Contract Manager in State Office to ensure visibility of the performance issue. If the 
AEC representative is not able to obtain replacement furniture by discussing the matter with their contact 
at the Service Provider, the issue should be escalated to the AEC Contract Manager for assistance. 

If further escalation is required? 

In the event the AEC Contract Manager cannot resolve this performance issue, they might escalate to the 
Panel Manager, or the Delegate. 

Scenario 2: Cleaning Contract 

Scenario: A Service Provider is contracted nationally to deliver cleaning Services at all AEC State, 
Territory and National Office locations. At a number of offices, AEC employees have complained about 
the quality of cleaning, noting it has significantly dropped in standard. It is noted that this issue has been 
raised directly with the cleaners at these locations, however there has been no improvement. This 
contract is managed at the National Office Level. 

Resolution and escalation: This issue should be escalated to the AEC Contract Manager in National 
Office for performance management as the issues have not been resolved at the local level. The AEC 
Contract Manager will require detailed information on the performance issue and information on the 
attempts made to improve Services at the local level. The AEC Contract Manager should then raise the 
matter with the Service Provider to seek resolution. This may include developing an agreed performance 
improvement plan and rectification process, increased reporting, and increased contract meetings to 
monitor the delivery of Services until the performance standard is being consistently met. 

If further escalation is required? 

In the event the AEC Contract Manager cannot resolve this performance issue, they may seek guidance 
from CLP and issue formal performance notices, or escalate to the Delegate.

Scenario 3: Logistics Contract – Critical Elections Services 

Scenario: A Service Provider is contracted to the AEC to provide time critical Logistics Services in the 
direct support of an Electoral Event. The Service Provider is contracted under a number of Work Orders 
across multiple States/Territories. 

An issue has been experienced under one Work Order in relation to invoicing, with the State disputing a 
submitted invoice and refusing to make payment until a new invoice is issued. The Service Provider 
disputes the changes requested by the AEC Contract Manager. 

The AEC Contract Manager and Delegate have attempted to resolve the issue with the Service Provider, 
however no agreement can be made. The Service Provider is now refusing to undertake Services 
against any of the Work Orders until payment is made. This represents a significant risk to the successful 
delivery of the Electoral Event, given the volume of work to be completed by this Service Provider. 

Resolution and escalation: This represents a high risk and election critical performance issue and 
should be escalated to the National Elections Manager (NEM) and the Chief Legal Officer (CLO) for 
resolution.

Appendix 14 – Commonwealth Contracting Suite and DS4P 

Commonwealth Contracting Suite (CCS) 

Overview 

The Commonwealth Contracting Suite (CCS) was introduced to create consistency across 
Commonwealth contracts to minimise the burden on businesses contracting with the Commonwealth 
Government and to streamline and simplify procurement processes for Commonwealth entities (AEC). 

The mandatory components of the CCS are: 

(a) 

the Approach to Market (ATM) (incorporating the Commonwealth ATM Terms); and  

(b) 

the Commonwealth Contract (incorporating the Commonwealth Contract Terms). The CCS also 
includes a range of non-mandatory documents. 

To ensure that the CCS is being used appropriately, the Decision Tree smart form can assist AEC 
personnel in the process for procurement under $200,000. 

Policy 

The use of the CCS is mandatory when purchasing goods or services valued under $200 000 unless an 
exemption applies as outlined in Department of Finance RMG 420  (eg. Services are being procured through 
a panel arrangement). 

For procurements (non-construction or non ICT) valued between $200 000 and $1 000 000 (, the use of 
the CCS is encouraged but is not mandatory. 

Access 

The CCS is available at the following link:  http://www.finance.gov.au/procurement/commonwealth- 
contracting-suite/. A user login must first be created at  http://ccs.hosted-
gov.net.au/Infiniti/Produce/wizard/eec8694a- fa4a-4a18-a13b-
c5d0e23ff9f7/#./null?& suid=145205636728407839819597050268 to  access CCS.  

It is suggested that business areas consider developing a group login to allow multiple people to access the 
documentation developed for each procurement. 

Please note: AEC personnel need to generate new documents by use of the online smart-form for each 
new procurement activity.  This will ensure that the documentation contains relevant  content and is tailored 
to your procurement.  

Dynamic Sourcing for Panels (DS4P) 

The Department of Finance (DoF) has established a system called Dynamic Sourcing for Panels (DS4P). 
DS4P provides a new standardised and streamlined tool through AusTender for Commonwealth agencies 
to access detailed information about panels and to conduct procurements. 

DS4P enables Commonwealth agencies to issue Requests for Quote through a controlled system, rather 
than emailing providers. Responses will be received and then downloaded through the same system. This 
will help ensure receipt and provide an audit trail for the procurement. 

A number of panels have now been made available on DS4P. Agencies are progressively publishing Panel 
as their internal DS4P implementations are completed. As a result, the manual processes for request for 
quotes to some Panels will continue as normal (ie. via email) until transition is complete.  

No panel arrangements established by the AEC are currently available are managed through DS4P.Where 
a Panel arrangement that you wish to approach has transitioned to DS4P, you will need to issue and 
receive responses to the RFQ using this system.  

Access to DS4P

Appendix 16 – Black Economy Procurement Connected Policy 

Overview 

From 1 July 2019, businesses seeking to tender for Australian Government procurement contracts over 
$4 million (Threshold) are required provide a statement from the Australian Taxation Office showing they 
have a satisfactory tax record. 

This change in policy is known as the Black Economy Procurement Connected Policy (PCP) and aims to 
increase the integrity of government procurement, as recommended in the Black Economy Taskforce's 
final report. 

The AEC is required to adhere to this policy for all procurement with an estimated value of $4 million or 
more regardless of the procurement method being undertaken. 

How do I make sure my procurement adheres to the PCP? 

Any procurements meeting the threshold must include a mandatory requirement for all Potential Suppli ers 
to provide a Statement of Tax Record (STR). Potential Suppliers can request an STR using the Australian 
Taxation Office (ATO) business or myGov portals. 

If a Potential Supplier is unable to produce an STR their Submission will be excluded from consider ation 
in the procurement process. If the Supplier has requested an STR but has not received it before the 
submission date, it is at the AEC’s discretion to include them in evaluation activities pending production of 
the STR. At no time will the AEC be able to enter into an Agreement over the Threshold without citing a 
valid STR.
