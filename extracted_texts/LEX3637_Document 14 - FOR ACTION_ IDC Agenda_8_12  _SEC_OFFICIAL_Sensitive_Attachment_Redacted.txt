Electoral Integrity and Communications Branch: Cyber Security  
Spear Phishing Attempt Against the AEC

Overview 

•  There was a ‘spear phishing’ email campaign against the AEC in November 2023. 
•  AEC systems were not compromised in any way and the incident was managed internally. 

• 

•  We shared this information with the EIAT on the basis that despite being contained, the campaign 

appeared targeted and somewhat sophisticated. 

• 

It is also a reminder to be vigilant against cyber threats in the lead up to, and throughout, the proposed 
referendum.
