Hi team,

Weâ€™ve been referred the following video which was filmed inside a polling place without permission,
potentially identifies an AEC staff member and contains disinformation accusing the AEC of rigging the
election. We would appreciate swift action on removing this, particularly given the filming was not
permitted and includes a staff member. The video appears to breach both the Integrity and
Authenticity Policy and Privacy, Personal Data, & Personally Identifiable Info Policy.
