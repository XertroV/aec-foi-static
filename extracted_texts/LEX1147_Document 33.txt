Hi 

Thank you for reaching out. I had intended to create an agenda, however there’s really one one/two
components we’re looking to cover here. As we have invited a few members from the broader
Electoral Integrity Assurance Taskforce (EIAT), we’re hoping this meeting can focus more on escalation
and civic integrity policy pieces. I know you previously provided us with some documentation in this
realm so I will attach it to the meeting invite as a refresher for attendees.

We will look to schedule a meeting with only internal AEC staff to further discuss campaigns, comms
and civic engagement.

Please let me know if you require further discussion. Thanks again!

Kind regards,

Hi Anastasia,

I hope you had a good weekend!

Ahead of tomorrow afternoon, I just wanted to check in and confirm what topics the meeting will focus
on? We had briefly mentioned splitting up the follow up sessions between more campaigns, comms
and civic engagement focused discussions, and the escalation and civic integrity policy pieces. Would
be fantastic to understand where you're looking to dig in tomorrow, so we can ensure we come
prepared to make the best use of your time. 

We're very much looking forward to the meeting, please let me know if you have any questions for us
and we'll be happy to assist.

All the best,
