Subject: For awareness: AEC spear phishing campaign [SEC=OFFICIAL:Sensitive] 

Good afternoon EIAT members 

For your information and awareness, we would like to bring to your attention a recent ‘spear phishing’ email 
campaign at the AEC.  The detail of these emails is below.   

AEC systems were not compromised in any way. We believe this is worthwhile sharing with the EIAT on the basis 
that despite being contained by the AEC, the campaign appears targeted and somewhat sophisticated.  It is possible 
it relates to the proposed referendum given the targeting of AEC’s Indigenous Electoral Participation Program 
mailboxes.  

It is a reminder that the cyber threat environment for the proposed referendum is unlikely to be lower than for a 
federal election. 

Email details 
On 14 November 2022, at 22:52, a series of emails were sent to the AEC’s eight IEPP mailboxes, from the falsified 
email address support[@]aec.gov.au, with the subject ‘[email address] have 12 Pending incoming emails’. The list of 
recipients is as follows: 

• 
• 
• 
•

• 

indigenous@aec.gov.au 
indigenous-sa@aec.gov.au 
indigenous-wa@aec.gov.au 
indigenous-vic@aec.gov.au 
indigenous-tas@aec.gov.au 
indigenous-qld@aec.gov.au 
indigenous-nt@aec.gov.au 
indigenous-nsw@aec.gov.au
