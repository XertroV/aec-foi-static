NO.  DESCRIPTION 

Phishing attempt against the AEC 

•  There was a recent ‘spear phishing’ email campaign against the AEC. 

•  Up front: AEC systems were not compromised in any way and was managed 
internally. We also engaged the ACSC and continue to liaise with them. 

• 

•  On 14 November 2022, a series of emails were sent to the AEC’s eight Indigenous 

Electoral Participation Program mailboxes, from the falsified email address 
support[@]aec.gov.au, with the subject ‘[email address] have 12 Pending incoming 
emails’.  

• 

• 

. 

. 

•  We are sharing this with the EIAT on the basis that despite being contained by the 

AEC, the campaign appears targeted and somewhat sophisticated. 

• 

It is also a reminder the cyber threat environment for the proposed referendum is 
unlikely to be lower than for a federal election.
