Good morning 

Thank you for your inquiry regarding this election.

The address you have provided is different to the one that was provided by the Association,
which is the one that the ballot pack was sent to.

Can you please call one of the numbers below and request the replacement at the updated
address. You will also be required to state your old address and make a verbal declaration.
This contact should be made as soon as possible so that the pack can reach you in time.

Kind Regards

 | Assistant Returning Officer
