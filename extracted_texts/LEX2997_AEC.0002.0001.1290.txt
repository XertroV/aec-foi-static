AEC.0002.0001.1291

Guardian Australia have published our response to their media enquiry regarding MP Andrew Laming Facebook accounts today.  Please see a screen shot of the article below. I wouldnâ€™t usually interrupt your busy schedule to notify you about the media enquiries we receive, however, there has been a fair amount of media coverage regarding Andrew Laming recently and I thought I would alert you that the Guardian has referenced the AEC and that we will be investigating the requirement for authorisation.  This email is just for your awareness. Please let me know if you require any further information. Kind regards, Holly
