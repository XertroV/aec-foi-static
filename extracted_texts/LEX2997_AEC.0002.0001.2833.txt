Economic Society for their expertise and breadth of experience.47 back the government’s move. 13 would like it to go further. The new target of an unemployment rate between 4% and 5% will mean about 200,000 more Australians in work than the old target adopted in last year’s budget of an unemployment rate “comfortably below 6%”.The Treasurer says he won’t begin to tighten the budget settings until that happens.
