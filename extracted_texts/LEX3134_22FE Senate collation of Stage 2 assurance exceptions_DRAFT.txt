1. STATISTICAL ASSURANCE EXCEPTIONS  

1.1 
The purpose of this document is to provide a collation of Stage Two statistical assurance exceptions as 
part  of  the  2022  external  statistical  assurance  of  Senate  ballot  papers.  This  document  should  be  read  in 
conjunction with the External statistical assurance of the Senate ballot papers: Detailed report and statement 
of outcomes, dated July 2022.  

STAGE 2 EXCEPTIONS  

1.2 
The Stage Two assurance testing compared the physical ballot paper to the electronic data used in 
counting, contained in the Australian Electoral Commission’s (AEC) Ballot Paper Reconciliation System (BPRS). 
The second stage testing assessed whether: 

▪ 

▪ 

the electronic preference data file was an accurate reflection of the preferences recorded on the physical 
ballot paper; and  

the interpretation of voter intent aligned with AEC business rules as stated in the Ballot Paper Formality 
Policy and Ballot Paper Formality Guidelines. 

1.3 
For Stage Two assurance testing a total of 33 exceptions were identified. These exceptions related to 
the accuracy of the electronic preference data file (used in counting) and the interpretation of voter intent. 
Determination  of  voter  intent  should  be  in  line  with  the  AEC  business  rules  as  stated  in  the  Ballot  Paper 
Formality Policy and Ballot Paper Formality Guidelines.  

1.4 
The 33 exceptions have been determined and classified in accordance with the approved assurance 
methodology. The classification of exceptions is outlined in Table 1. An additional classification of exceptions 
has  been  included  in  the  table  below  to  reflect  the  assurance  findings.  The  categorisation  of  statistical 
exceptions now includes where an incorrect preference type (including related preferences) was admitted to 
the count. 

Table 1: Categorisation of exceptions related to the interpretation of voter intent  

1.5 
Of the exceptions used in the statistical analysis, 27% related to where a voter was disenfranchised 
from the election. Another 24% related to where the ATL voter preference sequence was broken too early 
within the first six preferences. 15% of exceptions related to the counting of an informal vote (i.e., where vote 
was informal and should have been excluded from the count).
