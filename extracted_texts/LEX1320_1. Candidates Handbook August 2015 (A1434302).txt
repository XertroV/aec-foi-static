About this handbook 

Are you thinking of standing or assisting someone to stand for election to the 
Commonwealth Parliament in either a federal election or a by-election? If so, you will 
need a clear understanding of the legislative requirements you must meet, and of 
your role and responsibilities under the law.

Remember, you and your supporters can play a significant role in helping to ensure, 
as far as possible, that every vote cast in an election counts.

The Candidates Handbook 

This handbook is published by the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC), the 
Commonwealth agency which maintains the electoral roll and conducts federal 
elections, by-elections and referendums. The handbook covers the stages for the 
electoral process relevant to candidates. 

Each chapter in the handbook lists the relevant parts of the Commonwealth 
Electoral Act 1918 (the Act), detailing how the electoral law applies to candidates 
and those assisting them.

The AEC suggests that you consult the Commonwealth of Australia Constitution 
Act (the Constitution), the Act and other legislation, including the Referendum 
(Machinery Provisions) Act 1984 referred to for the exact provisions.

Candidates must satisfy themselves about their own legal position and, if necessary, 
refer to the exact provisions of the Constitution and the Act, and consult their own 
lawyers.

You can access this handbook, the Constitution and the Act via the AEC website.

Offences relating to the election, whether they occur before or during the election, 
are listed in Appendix 1. Some electoral offences apply at all times, while others 
apply to specific periods.

The AEC can assist you by providing information of a general nature about the 
nomination process and campaign activity. However, we cannot provide you with 
formal or informal legal advice.

Candidates Handbook  Federal elections  |  By-elections  Page 4


--- Page 7 ---

Abbreviations and acronyms have been kept to a minimum. However, five are used 
throughout this handbook:

 ■ AEC – Australian Electoral Commission

 ■ AEO – Australian Electoral Officer

 ■ ARO – Assistant Returning Officer

 ■ DRO – Divisional Returning Officer

 ■ the Act – Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918.

The words ‘voter’ and ‘elector’ are used interchangeably.

At the end of this handbook you will find a glossary which explains terms that may be 
unfamiliar to you.

How this handbook can help you 

The handbook explains the steps you will need to take to qualify as a candidate and 
to comply with the law before, during and after an election.

At the end of this introductory section you will find a checklist (see page 8) that 
takes you through important details you will need to know and the activities you will 
need to undertake as a candidate, and indicates where in the handbook you can 
find more information.

Again, the handbook is intended to assist candidates standing for election by 
explaining relevant processes and procedures. It is not, however, a substitute for 
the law.

Public inspection 

You need to be aware that many of the documents you submit in relation to 
your candidacy will be made available for public inspection. These include your 
nomination form and your financial disclosure return. Exceptions may apply in 
certain circumstances.

Timing of the election

Federal elections 

The constitutional and legislative frameworks that govern Australian federal 
elections determine both the election timetable and electoral processes.

Both Houses of Parliament have separate provisions reflecting their different 
constitutional roles. A House of Representatives term expires three years from 
its first official meeting, but can be dissolved earlier. Once the term expires or is 
dissolved, the Governor-General will issue the writs for an election.

The Senate is a continuing body with senators for each state elected for a six-year 
term. A rotation system ensures that half the Senate is retired or up for election 
every three years. Two senators represent the Australian Capital Territory and two 
senators represent the Northern Territory. These senators are elected concurrently 
with the members of the House of Representatives. The duration of their term of 
office also coincides with the members of the House of Representatives.

Usually the House of Representatives and the half Senate elections are held 
at the same time. However, the Governor-General may dissolve both Houses 
simultaneously upon certain conditions having been met under section 57 of the 
Constitution, resulting in a general election for the House of Representatives and all 
of the Senate. This is known as a double dissolution.

The key dates in the election timetable are available on the AEC website.

By-elections 

Whenever a vacancy occurs in the House of Representatives because of the death, 
resignation, absence without leave, expulsion, disqualification or ineligibility of a 
member, a writ may be issued for the election of a new member. A writ may also be 
issued when the Court of Disputed Returns declares an election void.

The guiding principle in fixing the date of a by-election has always been to hold the 
election as early as possible so that the electors are not left without representation 
any longer than is necessary.

1. The writ

 ■ Part VIII, ‘Enrolment’

 ■ Part XIII, ‘Writs for elections’

 ■ Part XIX, ‘The return of the writs’

The issue of a writ triggers the election process and provides the opportunity for you 
to nominate as a candidate. The writ is the legal document necessary for the official 
timetable and process for the election to begin.

Issue of the writ
The Constitution, s.12 and s.32
The Act, s.151 and s.152

The issuing of the writs triggers the election process. The writs are deemed to be 
issued at 6pm on the day they are issued.

The writs must be issued within 10 days from the expiry of the House of 
Representatives or from the proclamation of a dissolution of the House of 
Representatives. If the Senate is dissolved, the writs must be issued within 10 days 
of dissolution.

House of Representatives 
The Constitution, s.32 and s.33
The Act, s.154

The Governor-General issues the writs for a general election of members of the 
House of Representatives. They are addressed to the Electoral Commissioner, who 
advises each Divisional Returning Officer (DRO) of the dates specified in the writs 
and directs them to make election arrangements.

Candidates Handbook  Federal elections  |  By-elections  Page 9


--- Page 12 ---

Eight writs are issued for each general election of the House of Representatives: one 
in each state and one each for the Australian Capital Territory and Northern Territory.

Senate
The Constitution, s.12
The Act, s.151 and s.153

The writ for the election of senators for a state is issued by the governor of the state 
and is addressed to the Australian Electoral Officer (AEO) for that particular state. 
The writ for the election of senators for a territory is issued by the Governor-General 
and is addressed to the AEO for that particular territory.

Dates fixed in the writ
The Act, s.152 and s.154

The writ specifies the key dates of an election in accordance with the legislated 
election timetable. These dates specify the timing for the close of the rolls, the close 
of nominations, the election day and the return of the writ.

The AEC advertises these dates within major newspapers circulating in each state 
and territory and on the AEC website. An indicative election timetable is shown on 
page 13.

Close of rolls 
The Act, s.102 and s.155

The rolls close at 8pm on the seventh day after the date of the issue of the writ.

Close of nominations 
The Act, s.156

The date for the close of nominations is set out in the writ. It must be at least 
10 days, but not more than 27 days, after the date of issue of the writ. You can 
nominate as a candidate during AEC business hours any time after the writ is issued 
up to 12 noon on the day nominations close. The Act strictly prescribes where you 
must submit your nomination form and deposit. Nominations cannot be accepted 
under any circumstances if those requirements are not met. 

Candidates Handbook  Federal elections  |  By-elections  Page 10


--- Page 13 ---

Declaration of nominations 
The Act, s.175 and s.176 

Nominations are publicly declared 24 hours after they close. Your nomination form 
will be made available for public inspection at this time.

Election day 
The Act, s.157 and s.158 

Election day is set out in the writ. It must be between 23 and 31 days after the close 
of nominations. Election day must be a Saturday.

Return of writ and declaration of the poll
The Act, s.152, s.159, s.283 and s.284 

Each writ for an election must be returned on or before the date fixed for its return, 
which must be within 100 days of its issue.

In a House of Representatives election or by-election, the DRO of each division will, 
as soon as practicable after it has been determined that a candidate has been 
elected, publicly declare the name of the elected candidate. After all votes have 
been counted the DRO prepares a statement setting out the result of the election. 
This statement is sent to the Electoral Commissioner.

After receiving a statement of results from every DRO, the Electoral Commissioner 
endorses the name of each candidate elected for each electoral division in the 
state or territory on a certificate and attaches it to the relevant writ. The Electoral 
Commissioner then returns the writs to the Governor-General or to the Speaker in 
the case of a by-election.

In a Senate election the AEO, as soon as convenient after the election result has 
been determined, publicly declares the result of the election and the names of the 
candidates elected. The AEO then returns the writ to the governor of the state or, in 
the case of the territories, to the Governor-General.

Candidates Handbook  Federal elections  |  By-elections  Page 11

Meeting of parliament
The Constitution, s.5

The new parliament meets within 30 days of the day appointed for the return of the 
writs.

The table on page 13 provides an indication of the election period timetable from 
the time of the expiry or dissolution of the House of Representatives. The actual 
timetable will be published on the AEC website after the writs are issued for an 
election.

2. Nominations

 ■ Part XIII, ‘Writs for elections’

 ■ Part XIV, ‘The nominations’

The Constitution

s.43 and s.44

Candidates can nominate anytime from the issue of the writ until close of

 ■ information about who is qualified to nominate, 

 ■ important issues relating to the timing of nominations, and 

 ■ different rules for single and bulk nominations.

For your nomination to be accepted you must pay a nomination deposit in the 
approved format and properly complete and sign the nomination form.

You are encouraged to lodge your nomination as early as possible within the 
specified timeframe. 

Further information on nominations can be found on the AEC Website.

Candidate briefing sessions

Candidate briefing sessions are held by state and divisional offices before and after 
the close of nominations to provide candidates with information about the polling 
process and to outline their rights and responsibilities as a candidate in an election. 
Candidates may attend themselves or send a representative. At these sessions, 
information packs containing a variety of materials will be available.

For information on dates and time of briefing sessions:

 ■ candidates for the House of Representatives should contact the division for 

which they are nominating.

 ■ candidates for the Senate should contact the relevant AEC state office in the 

state or territory where they are nominating as a candidate.

Candidates Handbook  Federal elections  |  By-elections  Page 14


--- Page 17 ---

Who can nominate as a candidate?
The Act, s.163 and s.164, the Constitution s.43

The qualifications for nominating as a candidate for the House of Representatives 
or the Senate are the same. To nominate for election to either the House of 
Representatives or the Senate, you must be:

 ■ at least 18 years old,

 ■ an Australian citizen, and

 ■ either enrolled or eligible to be enrolled on the Commonwealth electoral roll.

A member of the House of Representatives or Senate cannot be chosen or sit as a 
member of the other House of Parliament.

You cannot nominate for the House of Representatives or Senate if you:

 ■ are currently a member of a state parliament or a territory legislative assembly 

and have not resigned before the hour of nomination (i.e. 12 noon on the 
day nominations close). As state and territory laws govern the manner of 
resignation, intending candidates should make sure their resignations are 
effective before the hour of nomination.

 ■ are disqualified by section 44 of the Constitution.

Disqualification under the Constitution

Section 44 of the Constitution disqualifies certain people from being elected to the 
Commonwealth Parliament. Section 44 of the Constitution is reproduced below.

44. Any person who –

(i) 

(ii) 

is under any acknowledgment of allegiance, obedience, or adherence to a 
foreign power, or is a subject or a citizen or entitled to the rights or privileges 
of a subject or a citizen of a foreign power; or

is attainted of treason, or has been convicted and is under sentence, or 
subject to be sentenced, for any offence punishable under the law of the 
Commonwealth or of a State by imprisonment for one year or longer; or

(iii)  is an undischarged bankrupt or insolvent; or

Candidates Handbook  Federal elections  |  By-elections  Page 15


--- Page 18 ---

(iv)  holds any office of profit under the Crown, or any pension payable during the 
pleasure of the Crown out of any of the revenues of the Commonwealth; or

(v)  has any direct or indirect pecuniary interest in any agreement with the Public 
Service of the Commonwealth otherwise than as a member and in common 
with the other members of an incorporated company consisting of more than 
twenty-five persons;  
shall be incapable of being chosen or of sitting as a senator or a member of 
the House of Representatives.

But subsection (iv) does not apply to the office of any of the Queen’s Ministers of 
State for the Commonwealth, or of any of the Queen’s Ministers for a State, or to the 
receipt of pay, half-pay, or a pension, by any person as an officer or member of the 
Queen’s navy or army, or to the receipt of pay as an officer or member of the naval 
or military forces of the Commonwealth by any person whose services are not wholly 
employed by the Commonwealth.

The Act, s.36

No candidate may be appointed as an electoral officer of any description, either 
as a permanent officer or as a polling official. If an electoral officer becomes a 
candidate, they must vacate the office.

For more information see the Electoral Backgrounder on Constitutional 
Disqualifications and Intending Candidates, which is available on the AEC 
website or from AEC national and state offices.

‘Office of profit’ disqualification

In its November 1992 decision in the case of Sykes v. Cleary, the High Court voided 
the election of Mr Phil Cleary as member of the House of Representatives for the 
Division of Wills. Mr Cleary was disqualified from being chosen as a member under 
section 44(iv) of the Constitution on the grounds that, as a Victorian state school 
teacher on leave without pay, he held an ‘office of profit’ under the Crown. This case 
has been approved in subsequent High Court applications.

If you are a Commonwealth, state or territory public servant and wish to nominate 
for election to the Commonwealth Parliament, you should resign before nomination 
in order to comply with the Constitution. Conditions of re-entry to the various public 
services by unsuccessful candidates are matters for the relevant public service 
authority.

Candidates Handbook  Federal elections  |  By-elections  Page 16


--- Page 19 ---

Commonwealth public servants who resign to contest an election and who are 
unsuccessful may apply for re-appointment or re-engagement under section 32 
of the Public Service Act 1999. A former officer or former temporary employee is 
required to be re-appointed or re-engaged subject to certain conditions.

Most states and territories have comparable statutory or administrative provisions. 
The position of local government employees is not clear and it might be that such 
persons are vulnerable to the office of profit disqualification. Section 327(3) of the 
Act provides some protection for local government employees who become, are, or 
have been candidates. If you are a local government employee you should check 
with the relevant authorities before resigning or nominating.

The Constitutional disqualification on the ground of ‘office of profit’ applies to 
permanent members of the Australian Defence Force (ADF). If you are a member 
of the ADF you should consult the relevant Defence authority on conditions of 
resignation and re-entry.

‘Foreign allegiance’ disqualification

In the Sykes v. Cleary decision the High Court also commented on the ‘foreign 
allegiance’ disqualification in section 44(i) of the Constitution. The majority view of 
the Court was that naturalised Australian citizens who also have foreign citizenship 
and are standing as candidates should take ‘reasonable steps to renounce foreign 
nationality’. The steps to take for renunciation may depend upon foreign law. If 
you have foreign citizenship you should check with the relevant embassy or high 
commission about the procedures for renouncing it.

In the case of Sue v. Hill in June 1999 the High Court decided that Ms Heather 
Hill was not duly elected as a senator for Queensland at the 1998 federal election 
because she was disqualified under section 44(i) of the Constitution. Ms Hill was a 
British subject and an Australian citizen at the time of her nomination. The United 
Kingdom is regarded as a ‘foreign power’ for the purposes of section 44(i).

You are required to sign a declaration on the nomination form that you are 
qualified under the Constitution and the laws of the Commonwealth to be 
elected to the Commonwealth Parliament.

If you have any doubts as to your qualifications under the Constitution, 
the AEC recommends you seek your own legal advice. The AEC does not 
provide legal advice to prospective candidates.

Candidates Handbook  Federal elections  |  By-elections  Page 17


--- Page 20 ---

When can I nominate? 

You cannot nominate as a candidate until the writ for the election has been issued. 
The writ is deemed to have been issued at 6pm on the day on which it is issued.  
The intention to hold an election is often announced some days before the writ is 
issued. If you are unsure, check with an AEC office or visit the AEC website.

The date fixed for the close of nominations will be between 10 days and 27 days 
after the issue of the writ and this date is specified in the writ. The AEC advertises 
the dates from the writ within major newspapers circulating in the relevant state or 
territory. Also, after the election is announced, an election timetable as outlined in 
the writ is published on the AEC website.

You can nominate as a candidate during AEC business hours any time after the writ 
is issued up to 12 noon on the day nominations close. Single nominations for the 
House of Representatives must be lodged with the relevant DRO by 12 noon on 
the day nominations close. Bulk nominations of candidates endorsed by a political 
party for the House of Representatives must be lodged with the relevant AEO not 
less than 48 hours before the close of nominations. All Senate nominations must 
be lodged with the relevant AEO before the close of nominations.

Nominations lodged with another officer or at another place cannot be 
accepted.

You are advised to lodge your nomination before the day nominations 
close. Late nominations cannot be accepted under any circumstances.

Nomination forms 

There are several different options when nominating for the House of 
Representatives or the Senate, each option using a different nomination form. 
You need to complete the nomination form for the relevant option, as well as 
an individual candidate details form (Form 59 or Form 60) for each candidate 
nominated.

Candidates Handbook  Federal elections  |  By-elections  Page 18


--- Page 21 ---

Note: for elections held on the same day, you can only nominate for one House 
of Representatives division, or for the Senate in only one state or territory. If you 
nominate more than once all your nominations will be invalid.

Blank nomination forms for the House of Representatives and the Senate are 
available from AEC offices or by phoning the AEC on 13 23 26. Once the writ for the 
election has been issued, the forms will also be available on the AEC website.

It is against the law to include false or misleading information in a nomination form. 
Giving false or misleading information is a serious offence. In addition, you must not 
omit any information if omitting that information would be misleading. The maximum 
penalty for this offence is imprisonment for 12 months.

All nomination forms are made public at declaration time (12 noon on the day after 
nominations close) and remain public documents at the office of the relevant AEO or 
DRO. All nomination forms are destroyed only after the next election. This information 
is also published on the AEC website. In certain cases, address and contact 
information may be removed from a candidate’s form before it is publicly released. 
It should be remembered that the media and the public use this publicly available 
contact information to reach candidates for information about their candidature.

Candidates Handbook  Federal elections  |  By-elections  Page 19

Nomination by a party 
The Act, s.4C, s.166 and s.169

If you are endorsed by a registered political party, the relevant nomination form 
should include verification of your endorsement by the registered officer of the party. 
The registered officer and the deputy registered officer of a registered political party 
have equal powers in relation to the nomination process.

If a registered officer nominates you, they may request on the relevant nomination 
form that the party’s registered name or abbreviation be printed on the ballot paper 
next to your name. If you are part of a Senate group, the registered officer may 
request to have the party name or abbreviation printed next to the above the line 
box.

Alternatively, the registered officer may provide these details in writing to the 
appropriate AEO or DRO before the close of nominations. 

A registered party may not nominate more than one candidate for the same  
House of Representatives division.

Nomination by eligible electors 

If you are not endorsed by a party you must be nominated by eligible electors; that 
is, people who are entitled to vote at the election for which you are standing.

House of Representatives nominations 

The electors who nominate a House of Representatives candidate must be 
enrolled for the division for which the candidate is standing. The names, 
addresses and signatures of the electors are recorded on Form 60c: Single 
nomination of unendorsed candidate by eligible electors. 

Note: It is advised to obtain the names of more than the required number 
of electors in case after the checking process, some are found not to be 
enrolled in that division. 

Candidates Handbook  Federal elections  |  By-elections  Page 22


--- Page 25 ---

Senate nominations

The electors who nominate a Senate candidate must be enrolled for 
the state or territory for which the candidate is standing. The names, 
addresses and signatures of the electors are recorded on Form 59e:  
Single nomination by eligible electors.

Note: It is advised to obtain the names of more than the required number 
of electors in case after the checking process, some are found not to be 
enrolled in that state or territory.

The Public Access Terminal at any AEC divisional office can be used to check names 
for enrolment details prior to submitting your nomination.

You should not leave lodging your nomination to the last minute as any defects in 
your nomination cannot be corrected after the nominations deadline.

Personal information 

When nominating for either the House of Representatives or the Senate, you must 
set out the following personal information on the relevant nomination form:

 ■ Form 60: Nomination of a Member of the House of Representatives, or 

 ■ Form 59: Nomination of a Senator. 

Your name

Your name must be specified on the form and must include either:

 ■ your surname or family name and one or more of the given names under which 

you are enrolled, or

 ■ if you are not enrolled, a surname or family name and one or more of the given 

names under which you are entitled to be enrolled.

A given name may be specified by either:

 ■ an initial standing for that name, or

 ■ a commonly accepted variation of that name (including an abbreviation or 

truncation of that name or an alternative form of that name).

The nomination must also include a statement of the form in which your given name 
is to be printed on the ballot paper.

Candidates Handbook  Federal elections  |  By-elections  Page 23


--- Page 26 ---

For example a person enrolled as Catherine Citizen must complete the 
nomination form in that name. However, she may request that ‘Cate’ 
Citizen be used on the ballot paper as that is a commonly accepted 
variation of her name.

Your place of residence 

If you are a ‘silent elector’, you are not required to set out your residential address 
on the nomination form, but you must supply the DRO or AEO (as appropriate) with 
an address. This address may be a postal address and it is not made public.

Your occupation details 

The Act requires these details to be provided.

Your contact details 

You must provide contact details on the nomination form, but you can ask that 
some or all of these details not be publicly released. Nomination forms will become 
public documents after the close of nominations. This information is also published 
on the AEC website. Contact details not for public release will be removed from 
any nomination form made available to the public. It should be remembered that 
the media and the public use this publicly available contact information to reach 
candidates for information about their candidature.

Declaration 

You must sign a declaration on the nomination form that you:

 ■ are an Australian citizen,

 ■ are at least 18 years of age,

 ■ are an elector or qualified to be an elector,

 ■ are qualified under the Constitution and other laws of the Commonwealth,

 ■ are not and do not intend to be a candidate in any other election on the same 

day, and

 ■ consent to act if elected.

Electoral officers are not generally empowered to question, challenge or provide 
advice on the declaration made by an intending candidate on the nomination form.

Candidates Handbook  Federal elections  |  By-elections  Page 24


--- Page 27 ---

House of Representatives nominations

A person can nominate for election to the House of Representatives as a candidate 
endorsed by a registered political party or as an unendorsed candidate.

The registered officer of a registered political party may make a bulk nomination of 
all the party’s endorsed House of Representatives candidates for a particular state 
or territory at one time.

A candidate may have the word ‘Independent’ printed beside their name when 
nominating as an independent candidate. 

If you are an incumbent member of the House of Representatives and you 
were elected as an unendorsed candidate at your previous election, and 
you are not endorsed by a registered political party, then Form 60c: Single 
nomination of unendorsed candidate need only be signed by one person 
(other than the candidate) entitled to vote at the election.

Bulk nominations

Each of the candidates included in a bulk nomination must complete a separate 
copy of Form 60: Nomination of a Member of the House of Representatives. 

Bulk nominations must be received by the AEO for the relevant state or 
territory not less than 48 hours before the close of nominations.

If a party chooses to lodge a bulk nomination, it must include all the House of 
Representatives candidates that the party is endorsing for the particular state  
or territory.

If a party lodges a bulk nomination and a single nomination for a candidate 
endorsed by the same party is also lodged, the bulk nomination of all that party’s 
candidates will be invalidated. This applies whether the candidate was included in 
the bulk nomination or not.

Candidates Handbook  Federal elections  |  By-elections  Page 25


--- Page 28 ---

If a candidate who was included in a bulk nomination withdraws or dies after 
the cut-off date for bulk nominations and before the close of nominations, the 
nomination of the other candidates in the bulk nomination is not affected. The 
registered officer may substitute a new candidate at any time before the close of 
nominations.

Senate nominations

A candidate nominating for election to the Senate may be endorsed by a registered 
political party or may nominate as an unendorsed candidate.

Unendorsed candidates may nominate individually or as part of a group with other 
unendorsed candidates.

Nominating as a Senate candidate

When nominating endorsed candidates the registered officer:

 ■ must nominate endorsed party candidates, or verify a candidate’s party 

endorsement,

 ■ must specify the ballot paper order of the candidates’ names in the group,

 ■ may request that the party name or abbreviation appear beside a candidate’s 

name on the ballot paper, and

 ■ may request that the registered party name or abbreviation be printed on the 
ballot paper beside the group voting square. Alternatively if the candidates 
are endorsed by more than one party, the registered officer may request that 
a composite name of the party names or abbreviations be printed beside the 
group voting square.

When nominating as an unendorsed group using Form 59c, the candidates may 
specify the ballot paper order of the candidates’ names in the group.

Each candidate in a group nomination must complete an individual copy of  
Form 59: Nomination of a Senator and Form 59e: Single nomination.

Grouped candidates not endorsed by a political party cannot have the word 
‘Independent’ printed next to their names or against their box above the line.

A candidate may have the word ‘Independent’ printed beside their name  
on the ballot paper when nominating as an ungrouped (single) and unendorsed 
candidate.

Candidates Handbook  Federal elections  |  By-elections  Page 26


--- Page 29 ---

The Act, s.211A

Incumbent independent senators who wish to remain ungrouped and intend 
to lodge individual voting tickets, must include with their nomination a written 
declaration to that effect.

If you are an incumbent senator and you were elected as an unendorsed 
candidate at your previous election, and you are not endorsed by a 
registered political party, then Form 59e: Single nomination need only be 
signed by one person (other than the candidate) entitled to vote at the 
election.

Group voting ticket (GVT)

Refer to Senate group voting tickets on page 38 of this handbook.

Nomination deposit

Each nomination for the House of Representatives and the Senate must be 
accompanied by a deposit paid by legal tender (cash) or a cheque drawn by a bank 
or other financial institution on itself. Cheques for nomination deposits should be 
made out to the Australian Electoral Commission. Money orders, electronic funds 
transfers, credit cards, personal cheques and other business cheques cannot be 
accepted.

A deposit is required for each House of Representatives candidate and  
for each Senate candidate.

For bulk nominations both the nomination form and the deposit must be received 
not less than 48 hours before the close of nominations.

For other nominations both the nomination form and deposit must be received 
before 12 noon on the day nominations close.

Candidates Handbook  Federal elections  |  By-elections  Page 27


--- Page 30 ---

Return of deposit 

The deposit for a House of Representatives candidate will be returned to the person 
who paid it or someone authorised by that person in writing if:

 ■ the candidate is elected, or

 ■ the unsuccessful candidate’s total number of first preference votes is at least 
four per cent of the total number of formal first preference votes cast for all 
candidates in that division.

The deposit for a Senate candidate will be returned to the person who paid it or 
someone authorised by that person in writing if:

 ■ the candidate is elected, or

 ■ in the case of an ungrouped candidate, the unsuccessful candidate’s total 

number of first preference votes is at least four per cent of the total number of 
formal first preference votes cast for all candidates in that state or territory, or

 ■ where the unsuccessful candidate’s name is included in a group, the sum of 

the first preference votes received by all the candidates in the group is at least 
four per cent of the total number of formal first preference votes in that state or 
territory.

All unsuccessful candidates not meeting these criteria forfeit their deposit.

Where to nominate 

Single nominations for a division for the House of Representatives must be made at 
the office of the DRO for that division.

Bulk nominations of all the candidates endorsed by a registered party for the House 
of Representatives in a particular state or territory must be lodged with the AEO for 
that state or territory.

Nominations for the Senate for a state or territory must be made at the office of the 
AEO for that state or territory.

It is your responsibility as a candidate to ensure that your nomination is completed 
and received by the AEO or DRO (as appropriate), together with the full nomination 
deposit, by the close of nominations.

Candidates Handbook  Federal elections  |  By-elections  Page 28


--- Page 31 ---

Lodgement with Australia Post is not the equivalent of receipt by the AEO or DRO. 
In addition, for the nomination to be valid it must include both the completed 
nomination form and the nomination deposit.

It is in your interest to lodge your nomination form as early as possible. 
Nominating on the last day may cause problems, particularly if there are 
deficiencies in your nomination that require time to resolve.

Faxed nominations 

You can lodge your nomination form by fax, but it is your responsibility to ensure 
this fax is received by the relevant AEO or DRO (as appropriate) before the close of 
nominations. For the nomination to be valid both the completed nomination form 
and the nomination deposit must be received by the deadline.

The possibility of transmission or print delays on receiving fax machines must be 
considered under such circumstances.

By faxing the form, you acknowledge the time of receipt is when the form enters the 
AEC’s fax machine memory. The AEC is not responsible for any deadlines missed or 
losses incurred.

Note: emailed nomination forms will not be accepted.

For a nomination to be valid both the nomination form and the nomination 
deposit must be in the hands of the AEO or DRO, as appropriate, by  
12 noon on the day of the close of nominations.

Appointment of agent forms 

If you intend to appoint an agent to act on your behalf with regards to election 
financial disclosure matters, you must lodge an Appointment of Candidate Agent 
form at the AEC’s National Office in Canberra before the close of nominations.  
The form and further information on appointing an agent, is available from either 
AEC offices or the AEC website.

Appointment forms and further information on appointing an agent are available 
in the Funding and Disclosure Guide for Candidates and Senate Groups on the 
AEC website. 

Candidates Handbook  Federal elections  |  By-elections  Page 29


--- Page 32 ---

Rejection of nomination 
The Act, s.172 

Electoral officers can reject a nomination if the provisions in the Act relating to  
any of the following have not been complied with:

 ■ the mode of nomination

 ■ the person to whom the nomination is made

 ■ the requisites for nomination

 ■ the form of consent to act.

A nomination will not be rejected simply because of a formal defect or error in the 
nomination if the officer to whom the nomination is addressed is satisfied there has 
been substantial compliance with the requirements of the Act.

Withdrawal of nomination 
The Act, s.177 

You may withdraw your consent to be nominated at any time up until the hour of 
nomination by lodging a withdrawal notice. A withdrawal notice can be obtained from 
any AEC office or by phoning the AEC on 13 23 26.

House of Representatives candidates must lodge their withdrawal notice with the 
DRO for the division for which they had nominated, even if their nomination was part 
of a bulk nomination. The registered officer may substitute a new candidate in a bulk 
nomination at any time before the close of nominations.

Senate candidates must lodge their withdrawal notice with the AEO for the state or 
territory for which they had nominated.

Once the withdrawal notice is in the hands of the relevant AEC officer the nomination 
is cancelled and arrangements are initiated to refund the deposit.

Uncontested elections 

In a House of Representatives election, if only one candidate is nominated, the DRO 
will declare that candidate duly elected at the declaration of nominations.

In a Senate election, if the number of candidates nominated is not greater than 
the number of candidates to be elected, the AEO will declare the candidates duly 
elected at the declaration of nominations.

Candidates Handbook  Federal elections  |  By-elections  Page 30


--- Page 33 ---

Death of a candidate 
The Act, s.156(2)

For either the House of Representatives or the Senate, if a nominated candidate 
dies before the close of nominations, the nomination period is extended by one day. 
If the candidate was part of a bulk nomination, the registered officer may substitute 
a new candidate before the close of nominations.

The Act, s.180 and s.181

In a House of Representatives election, if a candidate dies between the declaration 
of nominations and election day, the election in that division does not proceed.  
A new writ is issued for another election, but this supplementary election is held 
using the electoral roll prepared for the original election.

In a Senate election, if a candidate dies between the close of nominations and 
election day and the number of remaining candidates is not greater than the 
number of candidates to be elected, those candidates will be declared elected.  
If the number of candidates remaining is greater than the number of candidates to 
be elected, the election will proceed.

The Act, s.273(27)

A vote recorded on a Senate ballot paper for a deceased candidate will be counted 
to the candidate for whom the voter has recorded the next preference and the 
numbers indicating subsequent preferences are regarded as being altered 
accordingly.

Return of deposit on the death of a candidate 
The Act, s.178 

If a nominated candidate for either the House of Representatives or Senate dies 
before election day, the deposit lodged is returned to the person who paid it or a 
person authorised in writing by them. If the candidate paid the deposit it will be 
returned to their personal representative.

Candidates Handbook  Federal elections  |  By-elections  Page 31


--- Page 34 ---

Declaration of nominations 
The Act, s.176 

Nominations are declared and the draws for positions on the ballot papers are held 
24 hours after the close of nominations.

Candidates’ nomination forms will be publicly disclosed before the conduct of 
the draw. The media may inspect nominations and publish personal details of 
candidates. 

For a detailed list of dates and times for declaration of nominations and draw for 
ballot positions, contact your divisional office for the House of Representatives,  
state office for the Senate or visit the AEC website.

Provision of information on the certified lists of voters 
The Act, s.90B 

A candidate in a House of Representatives election is entitled to receive a copy of 
the certified list of voters for the division for which the candidate is seeking election. 
This copy is to be given by the AEC as soon as practicable after the close of the rolls 
and without charge.

Contact the AEC’s divisional office for the relevant House of Representatives division 
to arrange for the collection of a copy of the certified list of voters.

3. Ballot papers

 ■ Part XVI, ‘The polling’

The final form of the ballot paper for the election in which you are a candidate will 
be of particular interest to you. While the laws relating to ballot papers are set 
out in detail in the Act, there is scope for candidates to request certain options in 
relation to the way their affiliation with a registered political party, or status as an 
independent, appears on the ballot paper.

This section explains the law as it relates to ballot papers and the procedures that 
determine how candidates, or groups of candidates, are listed on the ballot paper.  
It also sets out the time frame in which requests can be lodged, such as a request 
for a preference order of candidates on a Senate ballot paper.

Ballot paper format

Ballot papers show the name of a candidate as specified on the nomination form 
and, if applicable, the name or abbreviation of the registered political party that 
endorsed the candidate.

If two or more candidates have similar names and this is considered likely to cause 
confusion, the AEC may add an additional description to distinguish them.

House of Representatives ballot papers are green. They have boxes with the 
names of every candidate and their party name or abbreviation or ‘Independent’ 
where applicable printed to the right of the boxes.

Voters must number every box by putting the number ‘1’ in the box next to the 
candidate who is their first choice, the number ‘2’ in the box next to their second 
choice, and so on until every box is consecutively numbered.

Candidates Handbook  Federal elections  |  By-elections  Page 33


--- Page 36 ---

The How to make your vote count fact sheet demonstrates how electors should 
complete both the House of Representatives and Senate ballot papers to ensure 
their vote counts. In a House of Representatives only election, voters who 
reside in states of Australia will receive a green ballot paper only. Voters in the 
Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory will receive both a House of 
Representatives ballot paper and a Senate ballot paper, which is white.

Candidates should carefully consider the information contained in this fact sheet 
when developing how-to-vote cards (see page 35).

Senate ballot papers are white. They have two parts: an upper section and a lower 
section, separated by a thick black line. A row of boxes above the line relate to 
parties, incumbent independents and groups. If an elector marks a ‘1’ in a single 
box above the line, then the elector’s preferences will be allocated in accordance 
with the group voting ticket of the relevant party, independent or group.

The lower section contains boxes with the names of every candidate and their 
parties (if applicable) or the word ‘Independent’ (for some ungrouped candidates) 
printed to the right of the boxes. If an elector chooses to vote below the line, that is, 
in the lower section, they must number every box by putting the number ‘1’ in the 
box next to the candidate who is their first choice, the number ‘2’ in the box next to 
their second choice, and so on until every box is numbered.

How to make your vote count

House of Representatives

On election day, you will receive two ballot papers: 
a green one for the House of Representatives and a 
white one for the Senate.

Green ballot paper

On the green ballot paper, you need to put a ‘1’ 
in the box beside the candidate who is your first

Political party names on ballot papers 

Only a political party registered with the AEC can have its registered party name or 
registered party abbreviation printed on the ballot papers next to the names of its 
candidates. Parties, however constituted, that are not registered with the AEC are 
not entitled to have a party name printed next to their candidates’ names on the 
ballot paper.

The request to have a registered party name or abbreviation printed on a ballot 
paper may be made on the nomination form.

Alternatively, the registered officer of that party may make the request in writing to 
the relevant AEO or DRO before the close of nominations.

Endorsed House of Representatives candidates 

An endorsed candidate of a registered political party may have either the registered 
name or the registered abbreviation of that political party printed next to their name 
on the ballot paper.

Only one candidate can be endorsed by a registered political party for any 
House of Representatives division. If a party attempts to endorse more 
than one candidate all nominations for that division will fail.

Endorsed Senate candidates

A group of endorsed Senate candidates of a registered political party who propose to 
register a group voting ticket may have either the registered name or the registered 
abbreviation of that party printed next to their group voting square on the upper 
section of the ballot paper, and next to each of their names on the lower section of 
the ballot paper.

A composite group of candidates endorsed by more than one registered political 
party that proposes to register a group voting ticket may have a composite party 
name printed next to their group voting square on the upper section of the Senate 
ballot paper. Each single endorsed candidate will, however, have their own 
registered party name or registered abbreviation printed next to their name on the 
lower section of the ballot paper.

Candidates Handbook  Federal elections  |  By-elections  Page 37


--- Page 40 ---

Independent candidates 

If you are not endorsed by a registered political party you may request on the 
nomination form that the word ‘Independent’ be printed on the ballot paper next to 
your name.

If you do not make this request you will have nothing printed next to your name.

Grouped Senate candidates may not use the word ‘Independent’ next to 
their name or next to the group voting square.

Senate group voting tickets

Boxes to vote above the line are provided to the following groups or 
candidates who submit a preference statement or group voting ticket to the 
AEC within 48 hours after the close of nominations:

 ■ endorsed candidates who requested that their names be grouped at 

the time of nomination

 ■ incumbent independent senators that have advised the AEC of an 

intention to lodge a voting ticket

 ■ unendorsed candidates that requested that their names be grouped 

at the time of nomination.

Notice of intention to lodge must be given to the relevant AEO before close of 
nominations. Within 48 hours after the close of nominations, a Senate group may 
lodge a written statement setting out a preference order of all candidates in the 
election with the AEO for the state or territory. This is referred to as a group voting 
ticket.

The preference ordering must be a fully formal vote meaning that all candidates 
must be numbered. In addition, the candidates in the group lodging the statement 
must be ordered ahead of any other candidate.

Candidates Handbook  Federal elections  |  By-elections  Page 38


--- Page 41 ---

The preference statement or group voting ticket must be signed by:

 ■ the registered officer of the party, where all the members of the group have 

been endorsed by the same registered political party, or

 ■ the registered officers of all relevant parties, where the members of the group 

have been endorsed by different registered political parties, or

 ■ the candidate whose name first appears in the group on the ballot paper, in a 

case not covered by either of the above, or

 ■ a person authorised by all the members of the group to sign on behalf of the 

group.

The preference ordering may be specified in the form of a how-to-vote card. 

A group may lodge up to three group voting tickets, provided that the preference 
order shown places the candidates in the group lodging the statement ahead of any 
other candidate, and gives the same order of preference for the members of the 
group on each ticket.

When a group lodges one or more group voting tickets, a square will be printed 
above the line on the Senate ballot paper. Voters wishing to vote according to 
the group voting ticket simply fill in that square with the number ‘1’ and their 
preferences will be allocated according to the group voting ticket during the scrutiny 
process.

Where two tickets are lodged, half of the votes are allocated to each of the 
preference orders.

Where three tickets are lodged, one-third of the votes are allocated to each of the 
preference orders.

Booklets setting out copies of all group voting tickets that have been lodged in a 
state or territory are available at every polling place on election day. Early voting 
centres and interstate voting centres will also have copies of group voting tickets for 
all states and territories and they will be published on the AEC website.

Candidates Handbook  Federal elections  |  By-elections  Page 39

Incumbent independent senator voting tickets

An incumbent independent senator may lodge a written statement setting out up 
to three preference orders of all candidates in the election. The statement must be 
signed by the candidate and lodged with the relevant AEO, and must show a first 
preference for the incumbent senator. The preference ordering may be specified in 
the form of a how-to-vote card.

Incumbent independent senators must signal their intention to lodge an 
individual voting ticket before the close of nominations.

Order of names on ballot papers 

A system called ‘double randomisation’ – two random draws – is used for 
determining the order of groups and ungrouped candidates on Senate ballot papers 
and the order of candidates on House of Representatives ballot papers.  
All candidates and members of the public are welcome to attend these draws.

House of Representatives ballot papers 

The DRO declares the House of Representatives nominations received for their 
division at 12 noon, 24 hours after the close of nominations. Following the 
declaration the DRO conducts two draws for ballot paper positions.

The first draw assigns a number to each candidate and the second draw determines 
the order in which candidates appear on the ballot paper.

Senate ballot papers

The AEO declares the nominations received for the Senate in their state or territory 
at 12 noon, 24 hours after the nominations close. After the declaration, the AEO 
conducts the draws for positions on the ballot paper.

In Senate elections, the names of candidates included in groups are placed on  
the ballot paper to the left and ahead of the names of candidates not included  
in groups.

Candidates Handbook  Federal elections  |  By-elections  Page 40


--- Page 43 ---

For the purposes of the Senate draw and ballot paper printing, individual incumbent 
senators who have given written notice of an intention to lodge a voting ticket are 
treated as a group.

The AEO determines the order of groups and ungrouped candidates on the ballot 
paper by conducting a public draw for positions. This draw is conducted in two parts, 
with each part consisting of two draws:

 ■ in the first part, the first draw allocates a number to each group and the second 

draw determines the order in which the groups appear on the  
ballot paper.

 ■ in the second part, the first draw allocates a number to each ungrouped 

candidate and the second draw determines the order in which ungrouped 
candidates appear on the ballot paper.

Ungrouped candidates do not lodge a group voting ticket and so do not have a box 
above the line on the Senate ballot paper.

 ■ Part XV, ‘Postal voting’

 ■ Part XVI, ‘The polling’

 ■ Part XVA, ‘Pre-poll voting’

 ■ Part XXI, ‘Electoral offences’

 ■ Schedule 2, ‘Grounds of application for postal or pre-poll vote’

How-to-vote cards 

Party workers may assist electors by handing them how-to-vote (HTV) cards and, 
if necessary, explaining the cards to them. Party workers are reminded it is an 
offence to print, publish or distribute misleading or deceptive statements relating 
to the actual marking of a ballot paper. When producing HTV material, parties and 
candidates need to be mindful of the colour and size of their material so as to avoid 
any confusion between the HTV material and ballot papers issued to electors by the 
AEC. HTV cards must carry:

 ■ the name and full street address of the authorising representative.

 ■ the political party of the candidate. If the candidate is not endorsed by a 

registered political party, the name of the candidate and the word ‘candidate’ 
needs to be included.

A person must not publish a HTV card during an election period unless the name 
of the registered political party or candidate on whose behalf the card has been 
published is clearly printed at either the bottom or top of each printed face of  
the card.

A HTV card is defined in subsection 4(1) of the Act. In short, it is any printed  
medium that lists the name of two or more candidates and directs or encourages 
electors to mark their preference for the candidates in a particular order. It does 
not include a card that only relates to first preference votes or only relates to last 
preference votes.

Candidates Handbook  Federal elections  |  By-elections  Page 42


--- Page 45 ---

There is a general prohibition on canvassing within six metres of an 
entrance to a polling place, which means that HTV cards or other non-AEC 
notices cannot be distributed or displayed within that distance. HTV cards 
must not be exhibited or left in a polling place.

Appendix 1 lists the offences under the Act.

HTV cards produced for electors by political parties and candidates need to have 
clear instructions and be well designed so they assist electors to cast a formal vote. 
Otherwise, HTV information may confuse some voters and cause them to cast an 
informal vote without meaning to do so.

HTV cards for electors serviced by mobile polling teams may be supplied by party 
workers to the team leader of a mobile polling team. It is not the responsibility of the 
team leader to arrange for this or to remind party workers to do so. Mobile polling 
teams will provide the electoral material to electors on request.

Electoral advertising 

The Electoral Backgrounder on Electoral Advertising provides a basic introduction 
to electoral advertising and is available from the AEC website. Its contents are a 
guide only. Individual matters are assessed on a case-by-case basis and ultimately 
it is for the courts to decide upon the interpretation of the law in any particular 
case. Accordingly, if you are in doubt about the interpretation of the law in particular 
circumstances, you should seek your own independent legal advice.

Candidates Handbook  Federal elections  |  By-elections  Page 43


--- Page 46 ---

The Electoral Backgrounder on Electoral Advertising discusses:

 ■ intent of the law

 ■ authorisation of electoral advertising

 ■ headings to electoral advertisements

 ■ electoral advertising on the Internet

 ■ misleading and deceptive electoral advertisements

 ■ second preference how-to-vote cards

 ■ truth in political advertising

 ■ defamation of candidates

 ■ electronic media blackout

 ■ political advertising bans

 ■ non-compliance, such as electoral advertising offences

 ■ complaints.

Candidates are encouraged to pay particular attention to the authorisation 
of electoral advertising.

5. Election funding and financial disclosure
 ■ Part XX, ‘Election funding and financial disclosure’

Some candidates will be eligible to receive payment of election funding following 
a federal election but all candidates are required to lodge a compulsory financial 
disclosure return. Candidates can appoint an agent to receive their election funding 
(if eligible) and complete the financial disclosure return on their behalf.

This section gives a brief overview of the role of candidate agents and Senate group 
agents, financial disclosure obligations and payment of election funding.

Further detailed information on election funding and candidate financial disclosure 
can be obtained from the AEC website.

Agents 

Appointing an agent

Agent appointment forms are available by phoning 13 23 26 or from the  
AEC website. 

A party agent is not automatically appointed as a candidate or Senate group agent 
unless individually appointed by each endorsed candidate of that party.

It is your responsibility to ensure that your agent appointment form is received by the 
AEC’s National Office in Canberra before the close of nominations. Completed forms 
can be faxed to 02 6293 7655, scanned and emailed to fad@aec.gov.au, or sent by 
post. Postal address details are available on the forms.

Agent appointment forms should only be sent to the AEC’s National Office, 
not sent to any other office.

Candidates Handbook  Federal elections  |  By-elections  Page 45


--- Page 48 ---

An agent cannot be appointed if their appointment form is received by the AEC’s 
National Office after the close of nominations. In this case, individual candidates will 
be responsible for completing their own financial disclosure return.

The appointment is valid for a single election only.

Candidate agents

Each candidate may appoint an agent whether or not they are endorsed by a party. 
Candidates who do not appoint an agent are deemed to be their own agent.

Senate group agent

Senate groups, the members of which have been endorsed by a single party, 
are not required to appoint an agent for the group or lodge a disclosure return. All 
receipts and expenditure of a Senate group should be included in the annual return 
of that party, however, individual members of such a group may appoint an agent.

An agent is not the agent of the individual members of the group unless separately 
appointed as such.

If no agent is appointed for a Senate group, or the agent appointment form is 
received by the AEC’s National Office in Canberra after the close of nominations, the 
first candidate listed in the Senate group is deemed to be the agent.

Senate groups endorsed by more than one party may appoint an agent for the 
group. If no appointment is made the person whose name appears first on the ballot 
paper is deemed to be the agent.

Unendorsed Senate groups can appoint an agent for the group. If no appointment 
is made the person whose name appears first on the ballot paper is deemed to be 
the agent for the group.

Eligibility of an agent 

To be eligible for appointment as an agent, the nominated person must:

 ■ be at least 18 years of age,

 ■ not have been convicted of an offence under the funding and disclosure 

provisions of the Act,

 ■ have signed a consent to the appointment, and

 ■ have signed a declaration of eligibility for appointment.

Candidates Handbook  Federal elections  |  By-elections  Page 46


--- Page 49 ---

A person may be appointed as the agent for multiple candidates, including a Senate 
group, but a separate form must be completed for each appointment.

Election funding 

Candidates who receive four per cent or more of the formal first preference votes 
in an election are entitled to receive election funding. For Senate groups, the group 
as a whole must receive at least four per cent of the formal first preference votes in 
their state or territory in order to be eligible for election funding.

The amount to be paid is calculated by multiplying the number of formal first 
preference votes received by the funding rate. The funding rate applicable to this 
section is available on the AEC website.

At least 95 per cent of election funding is paid in the fourth week after election day 
on the basis of votes counted as at the 20th day after election day. The balance is 
paid when the count is finalised and verified, and when the full entitlement is known.

In the case of independent candidates or Senate groups, payment is made to the 
agent of the candidate or group. If no agent is appointed, payment is made to the 
candidate or the member of the Senate group placed first in the group.

In the case of endorsed candidates and Senate groups, funding is paid to the party 
agent of the endorsing party or parties.

Detailed information about the payment arrangements for parties endorsing 
candidates or Senate groups can be obtained from the AEC website.

Financial disclosure returns 

Following an election, candidate and Senate group agents must lodge financial 
disclosure returns with the AEC. Further information, including a comprehensive 
funding and disclosure guides, is available on the AEC website.

If a candidate or Senate group does not appoint an agent or the appointment form is 
received by the AEC’s National Office in Canberra after the close of nominations:

 ■ the candidate is deemed to be their own agent.

 ■ the first person listed in the Senate group is deemed to be the group agent.

Candidates Handbook  Federal elections  |  By-elections  Page 47


--- Page 50 ---

Failure to lodge a disclosure return is an offence which may be referred to the 
Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions.

Election donations 

Election donations may be in cash (money, direct deposit or cheque), or ‘in-kind’ 
such as professional services or office equipment provided free of charge or at less 
than normal commercial value. Donations may be received directly by the candidate 
or by someone acting on behalf, or with the authority, of the candidate or Senate 
group.

In-kind donations must be disclosed at the normal commercial or sale value of the 
item or service.

People or organisations making donations to a candidate in excess of the applicable 
disclosure threshold are also required to lodge a financial disclosure return with 
the AEC.

If a person or organisation makes a donation to the campaign committee of an 
endorsed candidate, this is treated as though the donation is made to the relevant 
political party and is therefore required to be reported in the party’s annual 
disclosure returns rather than the candidate’s election return.

Electoral expenditure 

All electoral or campaign expenditure incurred in each of the following categories 
must be reported:

 ■ broadcasting advertisements (including production costs)

 ■ publishing advertisements (including production costs)

 ■ displaying advertisements at a theatre or other place of entertainment 

(including production costs)

 ■ costs of campaign material that was used or distributed where the name and 
address of the author, or the authorising person, is required (such as how-to-
vote cards, pamphlets or posters)

 ■ direct mailing

 ■ opinion polling and other research relating to the election.

Candidates Handbook  Federal elections  |  By-elections  Page 48


--- Page 51 ---

Certain other campaign expenditure (for example, hire of premises or equipment, 
freight, telephone and travel costs) does not have to be reported.

Candidates 

All candidates, including the individual members of a Senate group, have a financial 
disclosure obligation after the election.

All candidates must lodge a financial disclosure return even when no donations were 
received or expenditure incurred. In this case ‘nil’ returns must be lodged.

The financial disclosure returns of candidates must include the following:

 ■ the number of donors and total amount of all donations received

 ■ the names and details of people and organisations who made donations in 
excess of the disclosure threshold (this information is available on the AEC 
website)

 ■ all amounts spent on certain types of electoral expenditure.

The only exception is for electoral expenditure incurred by candidates who stand 
as part of a Senate group. These candidates do not separately disclose electoral 
expenditure as the expenditure of all members of the group is consolidated and 
reported as part of the group financial disclosure, or by the party if all members of 
the group are endorsed by the same party.

Senate groups

All Senate groups must lodge a disclosure return with the exception of Senate groups 
whose members are all endorsed by the same party. These groups report through 
their political party. Disclosure returns must be lodged even when no donations were 
received or expenditure incurred. In this case ‘nil’ returns must be lodged.

The financial disclosure returns of Senate groups must include:

 ■ the number of donors and total amount of all donations received

 ■ names and details of people and organisations who made donations in excess 

of the applicable disclosure threshold

 ■ all amounts spent on certain types of electoral expenditure.

Candidates Handbook  Federal elections  |  By-elections  Page 49


--- Page 52 ---

Where and when to lodge returns 

Returns can be prepared and lodged online via the eReturns portal. The eReturns 
portal can be accessed from  https://ereturns.aec.gov.au or via the AEC website. 
The easiest way to lodge a return accurately and on time is to use the eReturns 
portal, it is quick, secure, environmentally friendly and allows importing of files 
which eliminates transcription errors. To assist with completing a return online, a 
step-by-step guide is available on the AEC’s website.

If a candidate or agent is unable to lodge a return online via the eReturns portal 
the relevant forms may be downloaded from the AEC website. Alternatively, 
contact the Funding and Disclosure team by email at fad@aec.gov.au or phone on 
02 6271 4552 and forms can be emailed, faxed or posted to the agent or candidate.

Financial disclosure returns, including ‘nil’ returns, must be lodged with the AEC’s 
National Office in Canberra within 15 weeks after election day. The AEC has no 
discretion to extend this deadline.

Disclosure period 

The period covered by a return varies for election donations and electoral 
expenditure, for new and previous candidates, and for candidates and Senate 
groups. Details are on the financial disclosure return form.

Administration 

Candidate record keeping 

Candidates and Senate groups must give consideration to financial recording 
systems and procedures that are appropriate to their needs and circumstances and 
will enable the Candidate or Senate Group Return to be completed accurately.

All transactions should be individually recorded, supported by source documents 
and, where possible, reconciled to bank statements. 

Examples of source documents are:

 ■ receipts

 ■ tax invoices

 ■ loan documents

Candidates Handbook  Federal elections  |  By-elections  Page 50


--- Page 53 ---

■ wages records

 ■ bank deposit books and cheque butts

 ■ bank account statements

 ■ credit card statements.

Source documents should contain sufficient information required to complete the 
return, such as the:

 ■ date of the transaction

 ■ name of person and/or organisation from whom a gift/donation was received

 ■ name of person and/or organisation to whom a payment was made and what 

the payment was for

 ■ name and address of an organisation that has provided a loan to the candidate

 ■ total payment made or amount received

 ■ amount of goods and services tax (GST)

 ■ merchant fees.

Retention of records 

All relevant records, whether formal or informal, that support disclosures made in 
returns must be kept for a minimum of three years. Receipt books, bank records, 
receipt registers, source documents and working papers must be kept for this period.

Offences 

Section 315 of the Act contains penalty provisions for offences against the funding 
and disclosure provisions. These include

 ■ failure to lodge a disclosure return

 ■ late lodgement

 ■ incomplete and inaccurate returns 

 ■ failure to retain supporting records for three years. 

Public inspection 

Election financial disclosure returns are available for public inspection 24 weeks 
after election day on the AEC website. 

The Candidates Handbook, Scrutineers Handbook, Funding and Disclosure 
Guide for Candidates and Senate groups, and other electoral information is 
also available on the AEC website.

6. Scrutineers

 ■ Part XVI, ‘The polling’

 ■ Part XVIII, ‘The scrutiny’

As a candidate you have a range of clearly defined rights and responsibilities, but 
you are not permitted to participate in the administrative conduct of an election.

Because of this exclusion you have the right to appoint scrutineers to represent you 
at polling places and during the various stages of counting of ballot papers (the 
scrutiny).

The Scrutineers Handbook sets out how the law provides for the appointment of 
scrutineers, as well as the rights and responsibilities of scrutineers.

What is the role of scrutineers?

On behalf of candidates, scrutineers have the right to be present in order to check 
any possible irregularities when the ballot boxes are sealed, when they are opened, 
and when the votes are sorted and counted.

Scrutineers may observe:

 ■ the polling in a polling place

 ■ the scrutiny in a counting centre

 ■ the preliminary scrutiny of declaration envelopes

 ■ the further scrutiny of declaration votes

 ■ the fresh scrutiny of all votes.

Candidates Handbook  Federal elections  |  By-elections  Page 52


--- Page 55 ---

Appointment of scrutineers by candidates 

At early voting and during polling 
The Act s.200DA and s.217

You may appoint scrutineers to represent you at every polling place.

However, no more than one scrutineer per candidate is allowed in an early voting 
centre at the one time and no more than one scrutineer per candidate is allowed for 
each issuing point at a polling place on election day.

You appoint scrutineers by completing a scrutineer appointment form for each 
scrutineer. This can be obtained from any AEC divisional office or from the  
AEC website. 

You must give the name and residential address of the scrutineer and sign the form. 
A facsimile of your signature is acceptable.

You may fax the form to the DRO or the Officer in Charge of a polling place, if such 
facilities are available.

At the preliminary scrutiny of declaration votes

The DRO conducts the preliminary scrutiny of declaration vote envelopes. This 
process determines which declaration votes are admissible and can proceed 
to further scrutiny. The number of scrutineers permitted per candidate for the 
preliminary scrutiny is limited to the number of officers engaged in the scrutiny.

The preliminary scrutiny of early declaration vote envelopes can begin on the 
Monday before election day. This helps the DRO begin the further scrutiny of these 
types of declaration votes promptly after election day.

Early declaration vote envelopes are checked to ensure they have been signed by 
the voter and that the voter is correctly enrolled.

Any envelopes requiring further investigation will be put aside until after the close of 
polling.

The DRO will contact you before the preliminary scrutiny to advise you of its times, 
dates and locations.

The Scrutineers Handbook is available on the AEC website, from all AEC offices or by 
phoning 13 23 26.

Candidates Handbook  Federal elections  |  By-elections  Page 53


--- Page 56 ---

No declaration vote envelope can be opened or ballot papers scrutinised 
before the close of the poll.

At the scrutiny
The Act, s.264
You may also appoint scrutineers to represent you at the checking and counting 
of the ballot papers after the close of polling. The number of scrutineers who may 
represent you at each counting centre is limited to the number of officers engaged in 
the counting of ballot papers.

The appointment of a scrutineer must be made in writing and given or sent to 
the officer conducting the scrutiny at the counting centre. You must sign the 
appointment form (a facsimile of your signature is acceptable), which must give 
the name and address of the scrutineer. Once again, a fax is acceptable if these 
facilities are available.

You may use the same form to appoint scrutineers for both the polling and  
the scrutiny.

You may scrutineer on behalf of another candidate at a scrutiny as long as the 
ballot papers being scrutinised are not related to the election in which you are a 
candidate. For example, a House of Representatives candidate in Division A may be 
a scrutineer in Division B. You should check with the DRO or AEO (as appropriate) 
before making or accepting such an appointment to scrutineer.

At the further scrutiny of declaration votes

The DRO conducts the further scrutiny. At the further scrutiny, declaration vote 
envelopes which have passed the preliminary scrutiny are opened, and the ballot 
papers extracted and counted.

The DRO will contact you before the further scrutiny to advise you of its times, dates 
and locations.

Scrutineers have the same rights and responsibilities at a further scrutiny as they 
have at the scrutiny of ballot papers in a counting centre.

Candidates Handbook  Federal elections  |  By-elections  Page 54


--- Page 57 ---

Scrutineers Handbook

More detailed information concerning the rights, duties, powers and functions of 
scrutineers during polling and scrutiny is contained in the Scrutineers Handbook.

The Scrutineers Handbook also explains the different methods of voting, matters 
relating to the formality and informality of House of Representatives and Senate 
ballot papers, and the conduct of House of Representatives and Senate scrutinies.

Candidates Handbook  Federal elections  |  By-elections  Page 55


--- Page 58 ---

7. Counting the votes
 ■ Part XVIII, ‘The scrutiny’

An understanding of the AEC’s counting procedures will help you, as a candidate, 
know what to expect as the results of the election unfold. This chapter details how 
the scrutiny or count is approached for the House of Representatives and Senate.

On election night

The counting of ordinary votes begins in each polling place immediately after the 
poll closes at 6pm on election day. Ordinary votes are votes cast by electors either 
at a polling place within their division on election day, or as pre-poll ordinary votes at 
an early voting centre or divisional office in their division prior to election day. 

House of Representatives count on election night 

Ballot papers are initially sorted by the polling officials into first preference votes for 
each candidate and informal ballot papers. The results are then tabulated and the 
first preference vote figures for each candidate are telephoned to the  
relevant DRO.

Divisional staff then enter these figures for each polling place in their division into 
the national computerised Election Management System which, in turn, updates the 
Virtual Tally Room (VTR). The VTR can be accessed on the AEC website (see page 
57).

Indicative two-candidate-preferred (TCP) 

On the completion of the count of first preferences for the House of Representatives 
at each polling place, the Officer in Charge must, as directed by the relevant AEO 
(in accordance with s274(2A) of the Act), conduct an indicative distribution of 
preferences on a two-candidate-preferred (TCP) basis.

The TCP count shows where preferences have been distributed to the probable 
final two candidates in an election. It must be remembered that this count is only 

Candidates Handbook  Federal elections  |  By-elections  Page 56


--- Page 59 ---

an indicative result of the election in a division. It is possible that early, absent and 
mobile votes, counted after election day, could alter the outcome.

The ballot papers for the two nominated candidates are set aside and the ballot 
papers for the remaining candidates are distributed to one of the two nominated 
candidates according to who is more preferred or gets the ‘best preference’.

For example, if the two nominated candidates are Labor and Liberal then a ballot 
paper which has ‘1’ Democrats, ‘2’ Independent, ‘3’ Labor and then ‘4’ Liberal will 
be added to the first preference figures for the Labor candidate. Conversely, a ballot 
paper that showed ‘1’ Independent ‘2’ Liberal (etc) would be added to the first 
preference figures for the Liberal candidate.

Like the count of first preference votes, this result is telephoned through to the DRO, 
who enters it into the Election Inquiry System. This will update the VTR, which is 
available on the AEC website.

Senate count on election night

The counting of Senate ballot papers also begins on election night. The first 
preference votes on the Senate ballot papers – above the line and below the line are 
counted. A single figure for each group and each ungrouped candidate is reported.

Senate results cannot be calculated until the state or territory-wide total of votes 
used to determine the quota – the proportion of votes required by a candidate to 
be elected is known. It is only possible, therefore, to get a general impression of the 
Senate results on election night.

The Senate count on election night begins at the same time as the TCP count for the 
House of Representatives. Results from the Senate count are telephoned through 
to the DRO, and group totals and ungrouped results are entered into the Election 
Inquiry System in the same way as House of Representatives votes.

Virtual Tally Room 

The AEC hosts a website election results system known as the Virtual Tally Room 
(VTR), which provides election information and results in a user-friendly format.

The VTR allows people visiting the site on election night and the weeks following to 
access progressive House of Representatives results and figures from the Senate 
count for all states and territories, together with a comprehensive range of summary 

Candidates Handbook  Federal elections  |  By-elections  Page 57


--- Page 60 ---

and analysis screens. The VTR produces approximately 1 200 individual pages of 
results on election night and more than 20 000 pages in the post-election period. 
These results are updated regularly on election night and in the post-election period.

After election night

Fresh scrutiny or recheck 

The initial scrutiny conducted at the polling place on election night is routinely 
followed by a ‘fresh scrutiny’ or re-check of votes cast conducted by the DRO in the 
days following election day. The exact time will be advised by the DRO.

At this stage, some ballot papers earlier treated as informal may be admitted to the 
scrutiny by the DRO, and some ballot papers originally treated as formal may be 
reclassified as informal.

A full distribution of preferences is conducted in every House of Representatives 
division, even where a candidate already has an absolute majority of first preference 
votes. The result of this full distribution of preferences is used to calculate the 
two-candidate-preferred statistics.

Scrutineers who have been appointed by a candidate for the division may be present 
during the fresh scrutiny. The number of scrutineers present during the count is 
limited to one per candidate for each AEC staff member involved in the scrutiny. 

After election night the AEC conducts the Central Senate Scrutiny (CSS) process in 
each state and territory. The Senate scrutiny and the distribution of preferences are 
conducted using a computer application. This involves double data entry of all ballot 
papers that are marked below the line and have been dispatched to the CSS. Ballot 
papers marked above the line only are entered as a single total for each group. The 
computerised system calculates the quota, distributes preferences and determines 
the result of the Senate election.

This system provides full accountability and an audit trail, including reports for 
inspection by scrutineers. 

The relevant AEO notifies all Senate candidates by letter of the location and hours of 
operation of the CSS centre in that state or territory.

Candidates Handbook  Federal elections  |  By-elections  Page 58


--- Page 61 ---

Declaration votes

Declaration votes do not get counted on election night; instead, they are counted 
in the divisional office in the period following election night. The counting of these 
votes takes longer than the counting of ordinary votes.

In the days following election day, a ‘declaration vote exchange’ is carried out 
between the divisions within each state and territory, where declaration votes are 
physically passed on to the relevant division. Declaration votes received on behalf 
of divisions in another state or territory or overseas are sent to that state or territory 
and are then distributed to the relevant divisions. Once the declaration votes are 
received and processed in the home division, the counting of these votes can begin.

Postal Votes

For federal elections and by-elections, the legislation requires the AEC to wait for 
up to 13 days after election day for any postal votes to be received. These votes are 
included in the count if:

 ■ the vote has been cast before 6pm on election day

 ■ the vote is received by the DRO within 13 days of election day.

For this reason, the counting of postal votes is an ongoing process for up to 13 days 
after election day.

Candidates Handbook  Federal elections  |  By-elections  Page 59

8. Recounts and disputed returns

 ■ Part XVIII, ‘The scrutiny’

 ■ Part XXII, ‘Court of Disputed Returns’

You, as a candidate, can benefit from a good understanding of the circumstances 
and procedures leading to a recount of votes in an election, as well as the 
circumstances under which the High Court would sit as a Court of Disputed Returns.

As a candidate you can request a recount of ballot papers in an election, however, 
the electoral official is not automatically obliged to accept your request. The official 
also has the power to direct a recount at their discretion without waiting for  
a request.

Recounts
The Act, ss.278 and 279

A recount may be undertaken, approved or directed at any time before the result of 
an election is declared. It should not be confused with the routine re-check (fresh 
scrutiny) of the House of Representatives votes counted on election night.

In the absence of specifically alleged errors it is unlikely that a recount would 
be required at either a House of Representatives election or Senate election. 
However, in the case of a House of Representatives division, if the margin of votes 
at the completion of the distribution of preferences is less than 100, a recount is 
conducted as a matter of course.

Given the checks and balances in scrutiny systems, significant sorting errors are 
highly unlikely to go undetected.

Candidates Handbook  Federal elections  |  By-elections  Page 60

House of Representatives recount

If requesting a recount, House of Representatives candidates must write to the 
relevant DRO giving their reasons for the request.

DROs may initiate a recount, or be directed by the Electoral Commissioner at any 
time before the declaration of a result of a House of Representatives election to 
recount all or some of the ballot papers.

The DRO must notify each candidate of the time and place of any recount.

The DRO conducting a recount has the same powers as if the recount was 
the original scrutiny. A DRO may reverse any decision in the scrutiny to 
admit or reject a ballot paper.

During a recount the DRO may, and at the request of a scrutineer must, reserve any 
ballot paper for the decision of the AEO. The AEO must decide whether any ballot 
paper reserved for their decision is to be admitted or rejected. If a ballot paper is 
considered as being admitted by the AEO, the DRO will determine to whom the first 
preference has been allocated.

If an election result is challenged, the High Court of Australia, sitting as the  
Court of Disputed Returns, may consider any ballot paper reserved for the  
decision of the AEO, but may only order a further recount if it is satisfied that a 
recount is justified.

Evaluating a request for a House of Representatives recount 

The general guidelines observed in evaluating requests for a recount are  
as follows.

 ■ A recount may take place where there are valid and specific grounds for 

supposing that it could change the result of the election in the division or where 
there are specific grounds for determining the need for a recount of specific 
ballot papers (such as in response to specific allegations  
or incidents).

 ■ A request for a recount which does not plead any valid and specific grounds 

must be refused. A request for a recount needs to identify specific ballot papers 
and associated significant counting process errors or irregularities that could 
change the result of an election within a division.

Candidates Handbook  Federal elections  |  By-elections  Page 61


--- Page 64 ---

■ Wherever possible, the grounds pleaded by the candidate requesting the 

recount will be used to narrow down to as small a category as possible the 
ballot papers that need to be re-examined.

 ■ Where the margin of votes at the completion of the distribution of preferences 

for a House of Representative division is less than 100, a recount will be 
undertaken as a matter of course.

 ■ Only one recount of any set of ballot papers will occur.

 ■ Requests for recounts will only be considered, and actioned, in the period after 
the completion of all scrutinies and before the declaration of the poll in the 
division.

Senate recount

If requesting a recount, Senate candidates must write to the AEO for the state or 
territory giving their reasons for the request.

If the AEO for the state or territory refuses a request from a candidate to direct a 
recount of any Senate ballot papers, the candidate may appeal in writing to the 
Electoral Commissioner. The Electoral Commissioner is empowered to either direct 
or refuse a recount.

Evaluating a request for a Senate Recount

The guidelines for evaluating a request for a Senate Recount are detailed in the 
AEC’s Recount Policy for Senate Elections.

For more information on formality, see Ballot paper formality guidelines on 
the AEC website.

Court of Disputed Returns 
The Act, Part XXII 

Anyone contemplating a challenge to an election result should consult their own 
legal advisers. The validity of the election of any member of parliament may only be 
disputed by a petition to the Court of Disputed Returns within 40 days of the return 
of the writ. The Common Informers (Parliamentary Disqualifications) Act 1975 
provides penalties for ineligible members of parliament who sit as members or 
senators. Such an action has to be argued in the High Court under section 5 of  
that Act.

The Act, s.360(1) 

The Court of Disputed Returns sits as an open court. Its powers include  
the following:

i. 

ii. 

iii. 

to adjourn

to compel the attendance of witnesses and the production of documents

to grant to any party to a petition leave to inspect in the presence of a 
prescribed officer the rolls and other documents (except ballot papers) used 
at or in connection with any election and to take, in the presence of the 
prescribed officer, extracts from those rolls and documents

iv. 

to examine witnesses on oath

v. 

to declare that any person who was returned as elected was not  
duly elected

vi. 

to declare any candidate duly elected who was not returned as elected

vii.  to declare any election absolutely void

viii.  to dismiss or uphold the petition in whole or part

ix. 

to award costs

x. 

to punish any contempt of its authority by fine or imprisonment.

A petitioner cannot challenge, in the Court of Disputed Returns, the validity of a 
general election as a whole. The petitioner may only challenge the election in the 
division of the House of Representatives or, for the Senate, the State or Territory, for 
which he or she was enrolled on the date on which the election was held.

Candidates Handbook  Federal elections  |  By-elections  Page 63


--- Page 66 ---

What must a petition contain? 

Petitions must set out the facts relied on to invalidate the election and, if they allege 
illegal practices, must show how these could have affected the election result.

The Act, s.355 

A petition must: 

a)  set out the facts relied on to invalidate the election,

aa)  set out those facts with sufficient particularity to identify the specific matter 
or matters on which the petitioner relies as justifying the grant of relief the 
Court may at any time after the filing of the petition relieve the petitioner from 
complying with this,

b)  contain a prayer asking for the relief the petitioner claims to be entitled to,

c)  be signed by a candidate at the election in dispute or by a person who was 

qualified to vote at the election,

d)  be attested by two witnesses whose occupations and addresses are stated,

e)  be filed in the Registry of the High Court within 40 days after:

i. 

ii. 

the return of the writ,

 if the election day for the election in dispute is also the election day 
for another election or other elections–the return of the writs for the 
election in dispute and that other election or those other elections is 
returned last, or

iii. 

if the choice of a person to hold the place of a Senator under section 15 
of the Constitution is in dispute – the notification of that choice.

The Act, s.356 

When filing a petition, the petitioner must deposit security for costs.

Note: there may be other filing fees and charges under High Court rules.

The AEC is not able to assist petitioners in preparing petitions. This 
is because there would be a conflict of interest, as the AEC is often a 
respondent to any petition before the Court of Disputed Returns.

Candidates Handbook  Federal elections  |  By-elections  Page 64

Voiding an election for illegal practices 
The Act, s.362 

An election may be declared void if the court finds illegal practices, within the 
meaning of that term under the Act, took place.

Section 362 of the Act, which details when an election is declared void due to illegal 
practices, is reproduced below.

1. 

If the Court of Disputed Returns finds that a successful candidate has 
committed or has attempted to commit bribery or undue influence, the 
election of the candidate shall be declared void.

2.  No finding by the Court of Disputed Returns shall bar or prejudice any 

prosecution for any illegal practice.

3.  The Court of Disputed Returns shall not declare that any person returned as 

elected was not duly elected, or declare any election void:

a.  on the ground of any illegal practice committed by any person other than 
the candidate and without the knowledge or authority of the candidate, or

b.  on the ground of any illegal practice other than bribery or corruption or 

attempted bribery or corruption,

unless the Court is satisfied that the result of the election was 
likely to be affected, and that it is just that the candidate should 
be declared not to be duly elected or that the election should be 
declared void.

4.  The Court of Disputed Returns must not declare that any person returned 

as elected was not duly elected, or declare any election void, on the ground 
that someone has contravened the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 or the 
Radiocommunications Act 1992.

The Act, s.386 

Any candidate found guilty of bribery or undue influence or interference with political 
liberty may not be elected to or sit as a member of either House of Parliament for 
two years from the date of conviction or finding by the Court.

Election advertising offences
The Act, s.328, s.328A, s.329 and s.331

The Commonwealth Parliament has determined that the Act should not regulate the 
content of political messages contained in electoral advertising. The intent of the 
Act is:

 ■ to ensure electors are informed about the source of political advertising, and

 ■ to ensure that political advertising does not mislead or deceive electors about 

the way in which a vote must be cast.

The AEC therefore has no role or responsibility in deciding whether political 
messages published or broadcast in relation to a federal election are true or 
untrue. The AEC does have a role however, in doing its best to ensure that 
electoral advertisements are properly authorised, so that electors can know who is 
responsible for the statements contained in them.

Complaints must be made in writing, addressed to the Deputy Electoral 
Commissioner, and be accompanied by evidence of the material in question. This 
could be an original copy of a how-to-vote card, an electoral advertisement or other 
documents relevant to the allegation. Depending on the nature of the document in 
question, a scanned copy or an emailed photograph may be acceptable.

This provides the context for preliminary assessment of the matter and also enables 
relevant evidence to be tendered in court if proceedings are undertaken at a later 
date. The complainant should also provide as much additional information as 
possible to enable assessment of the alleged breach. The AEC will immediately 
acknowledge receipt of the complaint.

If an original copy cannot be obtained, a copy of the entire document may be 
forwarded to the AEC. Similarly, for a complaint about electoral advertisements on 
the Internet, the complaint should, if possible, be accompanied by a print copy of 
the webpage, showing the advertisement, from which the AEC can make a formal 
assessment of its compliance with the law.

In the absence of a printed copy of the advertisement as it appeared on the Internet 
being provided with the complaint, the AEC will require enough information about 
the Internet site in order to locate the advertisement and make an assessment 
regarding compliance with the Act.

Candidates Handbook  Federal elections  |  By-elections  Page 73


--- Page 76 ---

For more detailed information on the regulation of electoral 
advertisements, you should refer to the Electoral Backgrounder on 
Electoral Advertising, which is available on the AEC website or from AEC 
national and state offices.

Photographers and media 

Photographers and members of the media or their equipment must not hinder, 
inconvenience or delay any polling staff or voters. No photographs may be taken of a 
person recording a vote that would in any way identify how the person has voted.

Anyone arranging for photographers or media to visit polling places should contact 
the DRO in sufficient time to enable arrangements to be made with the officer-in-
charge at the relevant polling place.

Members of the media or photographers must have the permission of the DRO 
before visiting a polling place, and they must have the permission of the relevant 
DRO and the institution concerned before visiting any place where mobile polling is 
being conducted.

Further information, including guidelines on media coverage in polling 
places, is available on the AEC website or from AEC national and state 
offices.

Appendix 2: Additional information 
available to candidates 

The AEC produces a range of publications for candidates in addition to the 
Candidates Handbook. These include:

 ■ Scrutineers Handbook: information for scrutineers in the election

 ■ Electoral Pocketbook: a quick reference guide to the last federal election

 ■ Nomination Guide for Candidates: a quick reference guide for prospective 

candidates

 ■ Ballot paper formality guidelines: information on the formality and informality of 

ballot papers

 ■ Electoral Backgrounders: backgrounders discuss particular issues in the 

electoral process

 ■ Funding and Disclosure Guides: separate guides for candidates, political parties 

and donors.

Other information materials will be available during the election campaign. A copy 
of the Scrutineers Handbook is given to each candidate when they nominate at a 
divisional office.

General information on a range of topics is available from all AEC offices, by phoning 
13 23 26 or by visiting the AEC website.

Candidate information sessions

To assist political parties and individuals who are interested in nominating as 
candidates for the federal election, information sessions are conducted in each 
state and territory. These sessions provide an overview of the electoral process, 
including information on the nomination process and the rights and responsibilities 
of candidates.

To find out more about the candidate information sessions, contact the AEC on  
13 23 26 or see the AEC website.

Candidates Handbook  Federal elections  |  By-elections  Page 75

Official material available to candidates

House of Representatives candidates are entitled to receive a copy of the certified 
list of voters for the division for which they are seeking election, as soon as they are 
produced after the close of the rolls for the election.

Senate candidates are not entitled to copies of the certified list. Note: the certified 
list of voters is an official AEC publication and must be handled and disposed of in 
accordance with the Act. You must dispose of the document as per the undertaking 
you made on its receipt.

The Candidates Handbook, Scrutineers Handbook and other electoral 
information are also available on the AEC website.

of Disputed Returns. The court has wide powers to resolve  
the matter.

A declaration vote is recorded by a voter whose entitlement 
to vote cannot be confirmed at the place of voting. The voter 
makes a signed declaration on an envelope and then puts their 
completed ballot paper inside. These votes are counted after 
election day if the voter’s entitlement to vote is verified using the

Divisions (electorates)

Divisional Returning 
Officer (DRO)

Early vote

For representation in the House of Representatives, Australia is 
divided into electoral divisions. The number of these divisions is 
determined by population. To ensure equal representation, the 
boundaries of these divisions have to be redrawn or redistributed 
periodically. (For representation in the Senate, each state and 
territory is one electorate. All states are multi-member electorates 
and have the same number of Senators. Territory representation 
is determined by the federal parliament).

The AEC officer responsible for conducting the election in each 
division. The DROs are the returning officers for the House of 
Representatives in their divisions and are also responsible for 
electoral administration within that division, in particular, the 
maintenance of the electoral roll, providing information sessions 
to schools and community groups and preparations for the next 
election.
