Analysis of Indigenous Enrolment 

Population estimates 

Table 1 represents the ABS estimated resident Indigenous population 18 years and over by state 
as at 2016 and projected to 30 June 2019. 

The projected population for Indigenous Australians has been recently updated and adjusted by 
the ABS. Table 2 provides the AEC’s estimated Indigenous voting age population as at  
30 June 2018, before the more recent ABS Indigenous populations adjustments for 2018.

Indigenous enrolment rate estimates 

As Australia’s federal electoral roll does not have a personal Indigenous identifier, estimating the 
enrolment rates for Indigenous persons is problematic, however, having this key franchise KPI for 
the Indigenous population is important for Closing the Gap purposes and the AECs focus on how 
the franchise could be better delivered. 

In 2014 the AEC’s Research Section commenced indirect estimation of these figures, using a 
regression model of the relationship between the Indigenous population and each of the three 
franchise KPIs at a small area level, such as polling place catchment or the ABS’ SA2 geography.

While the models did not fit the data particularly well, the resulting Indigenous enrolment rates 
were statistically based on real data, rather than anecdote. Yet the resulting enrolment and turnout 
rates in particular were alarmingly low, and hopefully represented a worst case picture. 

Current method 

The Centrelink client file with Indigenous indicator available to the AEC annually since 2017 has 
presented an excellent opportunity, via matching to the Roll and mark-off data, to improve 
estimation of Indigenous franchise KPIs.  

While the results are subject to a number of non-trivial assumptions, the more direct estimation 
methods lead to a higher likelihood of robust results. The figures should nevertheless still be 
regarded as indicative only. 

As part of the Annual Roll Integrity Review (ARIR), the person-level matching between the Roll and 
Centrelink now includes Centrelink’s Indigenous indicator. However, as Centrelink customers 
represent only around half of the Roll, the matching (even if perfect) would be far from assigning all 
enrolments an Indigenous flag. Nevertheless, for the first time the AEC has a very large number of 
enrolled persons, over 6 million, matched to Centrelink records with an explicit Indigenous status. 

The enrolment rate, even for all persons regardless of indigeneity, is difficult to calculate reliably 
due to conceptual, collection and methodological differences between the Roll (numerator) and the 
ABS-based enrolment-eligible population (denominator, “EEP”). In the case of the Indigenous 
population these problems are magnified by having no Indigenous identifier on the Roll and less 
reliable estimates of Indigenous EEP.  

However, matching the Roll to Centrelink data allows a more direct method of estimating the 
Indigenous enrolment rate. Results for 30 June 2018 are provided in Table 2.

It is still subject to quite courageous assumptions, but as fewer are required it likely represents an 
improved approach. In summary: 

  For all Centrelink customers with an identified Indigenous or non-Indigenous status, 

calculate the proportion on the Roll. This is the raw enrolment rate of Centrelink clients. 
  Calculate the ratio of the actual AEC enrolment rate versus the Centrelink-based rate, for 
the same point in time. This is the overall factor to adjust any Centrelink-based rates to 
align with AEC enrolment rates. 

  Apply the adjustment factor to raw Centrelink-based enrolment rates by Indigenous status 

to give Indigenous and non-Indigenous enrolment rates.

  This process can be done at the State level, though results will have lower reliability. 

It should be noted that while this method avoids indirectly modelling Indigenous enrolment rates via 
geographic association, it does assume that any bias in Centrelink clients being enrolled is equal 
for Indigenous and non-Indigenous, and that there are no substantive Indigenous-status biases 
inherent in the Roll-to-Centrelink person matching. 

Centrelink data 

The number of Indigenous Australians that are identified both on the Centrelink file sent to the AEC 
in July 2018 and the electoral Roll does not represent all Indigenous enrolments. It is limited to 
those Indigenous Australians who both receive a Centrelink benefit and who have self-identified as 
Indigenous to Centrelink. 

After considerable data cleansing and analysis the AEC identified 72,451 potentially unenrolled 
Indigenous Australians. This represents around 61 per cent of the 118,581 Indigenous Australians 
the AEC estimate were not enrolled as at 30 June 2018 (see Table 2 above). 

The enrolment stimulation event conducted in February/March 2019 using 2018 Centrelink data 
resulted in the enrolment of 2,646 people who indicated they were Indigenous. This reduced the 
estimated number of unenrolled Indigenous Australians identified in the Centrelink dataset to 
69,143. Table 3 sets out the distribution of this cohort across states and Table 4 provides the data 
for electoral divisions. 

It is important to note that the potential unenrolled under 65 Indigenous Australians as at the 2019 
close of rolls represents those people that are on the Centrelink file sent to the AEC in July 2018 
and who were included in the February 2019 enrolment stimulation event but had not enrolled as at 
the 2019 close of rolls (18 April 2019). 

Analysis of the Centrelink potentially unenrolled Indigenous Australians 65 years and older 
identified significant matching error, due to the quality of data input and the nature of the residential 
status of this cohort. Work will be undertaken on the 2019 dataset to better understand this 
phenomenon to facilitate better targeting of potentially unenrolled indigenous Australians in the 
future.
