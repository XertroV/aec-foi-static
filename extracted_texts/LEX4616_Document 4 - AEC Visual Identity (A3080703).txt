The AEC corporate brand

The corporate brand represents the Australian Electoral 
Commission (AEC), what it does, its values and reputation. The 
brand is created by both tangible and intangible elements.

It is designed to present a consistent approach and style, so all 
AEC communication is instantly recognisable.

The elements that make a product distinctly AEC include:

•  The AEC logo (page 9)

• 

 The AEC purple (page 14)

•  The AEC voice (page 4).

• 

 Clear and strong typography (page 15)

•  Use of the graphic devices (page 5)

These elements should be a strong feature and prominent across 
both digital and printed products.

When producing material for the AEC, always consider its purpose, 
audience, distribution methods and how your product fits in with 
the AEC values. Designs should be uncluttered and clean, with 
minimal decorative elements.

All AEC communication should sit comfortably within the suite of 
AEC products. For more information on the AEC brand contact the  
AEC Communications Team.

How we sound

Voice

Tone

The AEC voice represents our personality and how we are 
perceived by our audience. It’s important that our voice is used 
consistently when communicating to all our audiences.

The AEC voice is:

•  Active (clear and direct)

•  Accurate (using facts and information that can be supported 

with evidence)

•  Accessible and inclusive 

•  Objective and impartial.

While our voice dictates what we say, our tone influences how we say it, 
and this can vary depending on the audience. 

For all audiences:

•  use straight-forward, familiar language

•  speak in a respectful and inclusive manner

•  use short, concise sentences where possible.

Decide whether your audience is internal/external, formal/informal to 
determine if certain abbreviations, acronyms and jargon are appropriate.

When communicating with an external audience:

•  Refer to the AEC in the third-person (Eg. ‘the AEC will deliver on its 

priorities’ instead of ‘we will deliver on our priorities’)

•  Limit clichés, jargon and technical terms.

For internal audiences:

•  Use of ‘I, we, us’ is encouraged in informal staff communication when it 

refers to the organisation as a whole.

For details and more information refer to the AEC writing style page 
on the intranet.

Start from the assumption that the voter has 
intended to vote formally.

Establish the intention of the voter and give effect 
to this intention.

Err in favour of formality where the voter has tried 
to submit a formal vote.

Are you entitled
to vote early?

Here is where you can vote from 8am–6pm

You can vote early if on election 
day you will be unable to attend 
a polling place because you:

  are outside the electorate where you are 

enrolled to vote 

  are more than 8km from a polling place 
  are travelling 
  can’t leave your workplace to vote 
  are seriously ill, infi rm or due to give birth shortly 

(or if you are caring for someone who is) 

  are a patient in hospital and can’t vote at the 

hospital 

  have religious beliefs that prevent you from 

attending a polling place 

  are in prison serving a sentence of less than three 

years or otherwise detained 

  are a silent elector 
  have a reasonable fear for your safety.

All eligible Australian citizens aged 18 years and older are required by law to enrol 
and vote. This fact sheet is not a legal document but a guide only to assist you to 
assess your entitlement to vote early under the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 
(Electoral Act). If you wish to see full details of the legal requirements as set out 
in the Electoral Act, please see the poster displayed at this polling place or ask a 
polling offi cial for a copy (EF050).

The Senate 
count process

Any surplus votes from elected 
candidates (votes in excess of the 
quota), are transferred to the continuing 
candidates who are the next choice of 
voters on those ballot papers. Because 
it is not possible to determine which 
votes actually elected the candidate and 
which votes are surplus, all the elected 
candidate’s ballot papers are transferred 
at a reduced rate. When a candidate is 
excluded, their votes are distributed at 
the transfer value at which they were 
received, in the order of highest to 
lowest transfer value.

Note: the example is for educational 
purposes only.

Counting Senate votes starts after 6pm 
when polling places close to the public. 
Counting of fi rst preferences begins but 
due to the high number of votes the full 
count cannot be completed until several 
weeks after the election. Senate ballot 
papers are scanned and checked for 
formality – the fi nal number of formal 
votes is needed to determine the quota.

To be elected, a candidate needs to 
win a quota — a set proportion of the 
electorate’s votes. This is known as 
proportional representation. The quota 
is worked out by dividing the total 
number of formal votes by one more 
than the number of vacancies to be 
fi lled and then adding one to the result. 

In this half senate election example 
(six vacancies), the quota is 69,993 
(formal ballot papers) divided by 
(6+1) + 1 = 10,000.

Colour palette

Primary colour palette

Purple is the AEC’s primary colour. It is politically neutral and has 
strong public association with the organisation. 

The purple should be dominant, and can be supported by blue  
and grey.

Please ensure that all applications of the AEC colour palette are 
accessible and comply with the WCAG 2.0 Accessibility Guidelines.

Secondary colour palette

A secondary colour palette exists to support the primary palette, 
however, its use is limited and should never over-power the AEC 
primary colour palette or brand elements.

The secondary colour palette should only be used:

• 

in infographics, to assist with clear messaging

• 

to add interest to campaign titles in pre-approved campaign 
materials (see page 22)

•  minimally in website applications, for easy navigation.

Formality
Principles

Australian Electoral Commission staff will apply the following 
principles to ballot papers when assessing formality:

Start from the assumption that the voter has 
intended to vote formally.

Establish the intention of the voter and give effect 
to this intention.

Err in favour of formality where the voter has tried 
to submit a formal vote.

Only consider what is written on the ballot paper.

Read the ballot paper as a whole.

Photography

AEC photography should reflect AEC business and the diversity of 
our community and staff. People should look real, comfortable and 
engaged – not staged. 

Images should be full colour, complement the AEC colour palette, 
and relevant to the content they are representing. 

Please ensure photos reflect correct electoral procedures and 
current COVID-19 guidelines. 

Do not use images:

• 

from a stock library

•  of low resolution or poor quality

•  where obvious digital manipulation has been applied 

•  without a signed Consent to use image/sound form.

A photo library of professional AEC photos is available. Please 
contact the AEC Production and Design Communications 
Team for more information.

Videography

The AEC has a dedicated YouTube channel, and regularly shares 
video content via social media channels. 

All video content should apply the AEC brand consistently, reflect 
AEC business, and the diversity of our community and staff. Content 
should be professionally shot by an experienced video production 
crew where possible. 

Graphic elements and animation sequence templates have been 
developed for use in AEC videos, including:

• 

intro screen (recommended for videos over 1min)

•  end screen (mandatory for all videos)

• 

lower third nameplates

• 

thumbnail templates

Illustrations 

A suite of custom created, stylised isometric illustrations have 
been developed for the creation of complex infographics and 
storytelling. These are available individually or in themed clusters 
from the AEC Production and Design Communications 
Team. Ensure illustrations are meaningful and fit for purpose.

Icons

AEC icons are simple, stylised and based on the FontAwesome 
icon toolkit. 

They can be:

• 

functional/interactive (to represent buttons/links)

•  explanatory (to replace a large amount of text)

•  navigational (to direct the audience through the content).

Ensure all icons use the AEC brand colour palette, are relevant 
to the content, and quickly communicate the core message in a 
recognisable way. 

Avoid using icons purely as a decorative element. Their purpose 
should always be to strenghten and reinforce the message.

Websites and 
social channels

All AEC websites, apps and social media content must use the 
AEC visual identity guidelines, to ensure a consistent look and feel 
across all AEC products.

Assets must be designed with accessibility, functionality and 
usability in mind.

Please consult with the AEC Web Team or AEC Production 
and Design Communications Team for any online or digital 
design requirements.

Social tiles

The AEC has an active presence across a range of social media 
channels managed by the AEC Media Team.

AEC social media graphics should be succinct, uncluttered  
and engaging. Please ensure the AEC brand colours and fonts 
are applied consistently to all social media tiles. A suite of branded 
elements and templates are available for the creation of social 
media tiles.

AEC Brand Guidelines

Branding exceptions

It’s important that the AEC presents itself as a unified 
organisation, with a cohesive voice and visual identity.

All communication materials from state offices, divisions and 
business areas within the organisation should be aligned with 
the AEC corporate brand. 

There are some instances that allow for flexibility and diversion 
from the brand. These are:

•  approved internal campaigns (see criteria on page 22)

•  approved AEC programs (see page 24).

Any diversion from these guidelines must meet the set criteria 
outlined in the following pages, and must be approved by the 
AEC Communications team.

AEC internal campaigns

Communication materials that are aimed at an internal audience, 
and appear within the confines of AEC buildings and the intranet, 
may apply the AEC brand with flexibility or develop a campaign-
specific look & feel. 

An internal campaign approved for exemption from the corporate 
brand must meet the following criteria. 

The campaign must:

•  have an approved communications plan

•  be aimed at all AEC staff

•  be aligned with the AEC’s Corporate Plan priorities

•  be developed internally in consultation with the  

AEC Production and Design Communications Team.

Campaigns
AEC election campaigns

Election campaigns play a key role in communicating election 
information to all eligible voters in the lead up to and during 
the election period. They are critical to facilitating successful 
participation in an election.

An election campaign brand may be independent of the AEC 
corporate brand, provided it’s clear it comes from the AEC, and 
mandatory elements are applied consistently in the AEC corporate 
brand guidelines.

AEC Election campaign materials should include:

•  AEC logo & modified version of the footer

•  AEC colour palette and primary font (preferred).

AEC programs

Some programs within the AEC have been identified as unique 
from a communications perspective, with regards to purpose, 
content and key audiences. They are the: 

•  Education program

• 

Indigenous program (IEPP), and

• 

Indigo Program.

These programs can have their own distinct visual identity, 
provided the ownership and relationship of the program to the 
AEC is always clear.

All program materials should complement the AEC’s corporate 
brand, and include the AEC logo, AEC colour palette (where 
possible) and body text font.

Education

An informal and playful visual identity has been developed for the 
AEC Education program, specifically to appeal to the school sector. 

This helps teachers and students recognise content designed 
specifically for education purposes, and allows for fun, creative 
options when visually presenting complex information.

The Education program brand includes the addition of a fun headline 
font – Franklin Gothic Hand – to be used on top level headings, in 
conjunction with the standard AEC body font (Helvetica Neue).

All education materials must include the:

•  AEC logo 

•  AEC body text font and colour palette.

The Education visual identity must only be used in consultation with 
the AEC Production and Design Communications Team.

Indigenous Electoral Participation 
Program (IEPP)

The IEPP leads AEC engagement with Aboriginal and Torres 
Strait Islander people. Its visual identity has been developed 
specifically to appeal to this audience and ensure we inform and 
engage Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in culturally 
appropriate ways.

Key elements of this brand are the stylised custom created 
Australia graphic and the colour palette derived from it. The 
graphic may be deconstructed to provide a range of design 
variations.

Three original artworks designed by Indigenous artist Marcus Lee 
are also available to use as supporting graphics if required.

All IEPP materials should include the AEC logo and footer bar 
(where appropriate).

The IEPP visual identity must only be used in consultation  
with the IEPP National Communications Officer and the  
AEC Production and Design Communications Team.

AEC programs
Indigo

Indigo is the AEC’s transformation program. It is a long term, three-
phased approach to improving the organisation’s core capabilities 
and transforming how we provide electoral services.

The Indigo visual identity has been developed to complement the 
AEC corporate brand, with the addition of:

•  a program logo

•  a circular graphic element

•  a new colour - Pantone Violet.

The Indigo logo should always be used with the AEC logo, either 
in a:

• 

 footer lockup  

or

•  separately on covers, posters  and cover pages where “Indigo” 

forms part of the main heading (as shown on right).

A suite of Indigo branded templates and design resources have 
been created to ensure the brand is applied consistently and in line 
with the program’s requirements.

Contact the AEC Production and Design Communications 
Team for further information or the Indigo team for templates.
