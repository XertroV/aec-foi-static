Hi Brian 

Below is the current summary of the email attack targeting state indigenous group mailboxes inboxes (account 
harvesting attempt). 

Some additional points to note: 

  This email campaign is very targeted 

  Staff in the network managing the mailboxes have been contacted 
  The emails are being removed from the mailboxes to avoid any future issues (completed 09:50) 
 

 

I’ve already given Julie a quick heads up given the thematic of the campaign and expect this will want a broader 
Integrity lens given the very specific targeting. 

 along with any other relevant updates as more information 

becomes available. 

Regards
