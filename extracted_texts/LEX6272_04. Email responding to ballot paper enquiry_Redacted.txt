Good afternoon, 
The voting packs for the PFA election were sent to members on 6 June 2024 via Australia
Post.
The address that these packs were sent to was provided by the organisation. If you did not
receive the ballot papers you may want to check with the PFA SA whether they have your
current correct address details.
The election notice also provided the AEC phone number so that members could request a
replacement voter pack if they had not received the first pack that was sent out on 6 June
2024.
Please do not hesitate to contact if you have further enquiry.
Regards

 |Senior Project Officer
