FAD
Womenâ€™s Party
Tuesday, 29 January 2019 1:20:22 AM

Dear Madam and Sirs,

I'd like to formally oppose this party being registered. The Women's Party exists in many countries as a Radical
Feminist Party. This is being registered as a non-feminist party which will cause confusion and garner false
votes.

Kind Regards
