Risks/Issues 

6.  It should be noted that, as a key channel to reach young people and for media budgeting 

purposes, Tik Tok advertisements are currently included in media plans. Communications Section 
is aware of recent media coverage around brand safety concerns with government use of this 
platform in Australia and overseas. Communications Section will continue to seek advice on Tik 
Tok’s inclusion from the DDU, UM and the Department of Finance to ensure this channel remains 
appropriate before formalising media bookings. This approach will also be taken to considering Tik 
Tok for any paid media partnerships, with reputation management a key selection criteria.
