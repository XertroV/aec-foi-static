Dear 
We understand you are now our appropriate contact at Twitter Australia. We thought it would be
good to reach out to you and confirm your contact details and our work together.
We note that Twitter is undergoing significant changes at present, but we welcome the opportunity to
confirm our continued referral processes in the support of maintaining accurate electoral information
and authorisations consistent with Australian law. For some background, you will see attached
referral documentation we used together in the context of the recent 2022 federal election.
We propose having a more detailed catch up in the new year with relevant colleagues here in the AEC
and from your team. In the meantime, please do not hesitate to contact us if you have any questions
regarding the Australian Electoral Commission, Australian federal elections more broadly and the
proposed referendum.
We look forward to working with you.
Regards

 | Assistant Director

Defending Democracy Unit | Electoral Integrity and Communications Branch
Australian Electoral Commission
