FOR ACTION: IDC Agenda_8/12  [SEC=OFFICIAL:Sensitive]
KG TPs - NIAA - Phishing attempt against the AEC.docx

As requested by Dr Gleeson / Mr Lynch late last year (see below thread), please see attached talking points on the 
spear phishing attempt against the AEC in November 2022, reported to the EIAT and queried by the NIAA.  

For quick reference, the NIAA has asked for: 

- 

Clarity re the purpose of the attack, trends, and what the overall risks are. Also would be good to understand 
what the EIAT is and whether a referendum specific one is needed. 

We have also provided context regarding the EIAT and its potential role for the proposed referendum, including that 
the Board intends to brief the NIAA / Referendum IDC. 

For your review and clearance to Michael please. 

Kind regards

Hi Kath!  

OFFICIAL: Sensitive 

Apologies about the mix up and I didn’t mean to put AEC on the spot. 

We received the below notification from the Electoral Integrity Assurance Taskforce (EIAT) about a phishing attempt 
on the AEC. 

I think it would be good to get clarity re the purpose of the attack, trends, and what the overall risks are. Also would 
be good to understand what the EIAT is and whether a referendum specific one is needed. 

At the last IDC it was decided to have a 1 hour session in January to cover it all off. Is that okay?

Subject: For awareness: AEC spear phishing campaign [SEC=OFFICIAL:Sensitive] 

CAUTION: This email originated from outside of the organisation. Do not follow guidance, click links, or open 
attachments unless you recognise the sender and know the content is safe. 

Good afternoon EIAT members 

For your information and awareness, we would like to bring to your attention a recent ‘spear phishing’ email 
campaign at the AEC.  The detail of these emails is below.   

AEC systems were not compromised in any way. We believe this is worthwhile sharing with the EIAT on the basis 
that despite being contained by the AEC, the campaign appears targeted and somewhat sophisticated.  It is possible 
it relates to the proposed referendum given the targeting of AEC’s Indigenous Electoral Participation Program 
mailboxes.  

It is a reminder that the cyber threat environment for the proposed referendum is unlikely to be lower than for a 
federal election. 

Email details 
On 14 November 2022, at 22:52, a series of emails were sent to the AEC’s eight IEPP mailboxes, from the falsified 
email address support[@]aec.gov.au, with the subject ‘[email address] have 12 Pending incoming emails’. The list of 
recipients is as follows: 

• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 

indigenous@aec.gov.au 
indigenous-sa@aec.gov.au
