Tom

Ahead of tomorrow morning’s interview I thought it wise to give you a reminder of
Credlin’s last prominent communication on electoral matters -
see https://www.skynews.com.au/australia-news/its-farcical-australias-voting-system-
doesnt-safeguard-against-multiple-voting/video/fe27a74c6fad37c4ae506b46b2af744a.

This was endorsing McGrath’s JSCEM recs with a heavy focus on multiple voting and
enrolment / voting ID. She also wrote an opinion piece in support of her on-air spiel -
see https://thewest.com.au/opinion/peta-credlin-fears-of-ballot-rigging-at-australian-
elections-ng-17a031b6f2ef5f10c794b07107b571d9.

Also, here is a preview piece for the doco she is putting together (the purpose of the doco
stated as being an opportunity to get behind the scenes of a campaign).
See https://www.google.com.au/amp/s/amp.theaustralian.com.au/business/peta-credlin-
documentary-to-unveil-secrets-behind-election-campaigns/news-
story/82c72472c74d0a8972597b342b70bcac

While she may stick tight to the purpose of the doco (for us, what it takes to deliver the
election) I wouldn’t be surprised if she asks pointed questions about integrity matters,
particularly multiple voting. 

The interview is at 9:30 in the command centre. I’ll be around beforehand organising their
camera people but can get 

 to babysit if you want to have a chat…

Cheers
Evan
