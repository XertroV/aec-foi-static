National Induction Program  
Roles and Responsibilities 

Participant 

Completion of the National Induction Program is a requirement as part of the Participant’s 
introduction to the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) and Australian Public Service (APS) and 
must be prioritised. 

Participants are ongoing or non-ongoing staff that are new to the agency, or who gain promotion at 
an identified level. 

The National Induction Program is designed for APS2 – SES level staff only, APS1 and staff 
identified to fill key election specific roles are outside scope for this program. 

Line Manager 

The Line Manager will be the responsible officer that conducts the National Induction Program 
locally. The Line Manager will either action or delegate induction activities, and provide feedback on 
performance that is in line with the Australian Electoral Commission’s (AEC’s) Performance 
Management Program and Probation Policy.  

In some instances the Line Manager may not be located in the same office as the Participant  
e.g. Participant is an APS6 in a stand-alone office and their Line Manager is an Operations Manager 
in the State Office. The Line Manager will: 

■  provide one on one training and support for the Participant on AEC specific information 

■  use and refer the Participant to approved AEC policies and procedures only 

■  ensure they are familiar with all training content prior to actioning each module 

■  be available to the Participant, responding to questions as needed, ensuring the Participant 

feels comfortable to seek support 

■ 

■ 

follow all instructions contained in the National Induction Program modules, including guides 
and resources, ensuring a nationally consistent program is delivered 

incorporate ‘why, how and when’ questions into one on one training to encourage the 
Participant to think about how activities are linked to their role or work area/branch 

■  delegate induction activities if required, unless indicated in the program as Line Manager 

specific e.g. Individual Performance Plans (IPPs) 

■  meet with the Participant at all assigned ‘Check-in Points’ throughout the induction and 

discuss role, performance and fit 

■  meet with the Participant within the first four weeks of employment to discuss and set up an 

IPP 

■ 

follow all guidance in relation to providing the Participant with feedback on their progress and 
other information that will support their development

■  ensure they maintain Participant records in ObjectiveIM, in accordance with local ObjectiveIM 
conventions, and provide examples to the Participant at all Check-in Points, probationary 
period discussions and/or IPP discussions

the feedback

throughout the induction period and beyond

■ 

refrain from voicing personal opinion on AEC policies, procedures and/or stakeholders during 
delivery 

■  monitor the Participant’s progress, and ensure that all modules and associated activities are 

marked as completed during the timeframes provided. 

Line Managers must complete all Manager Guides in alignment with the relevant module checklists 
to ensure all key information is discussed. Line Managers are reminded that they must give the 
National Induction Program and its resources ample attention to ensure that staff are set up for 
success in the AEC. 

Local Induction Adviser 

The Local Induction Adviser will be a locally based officer identified by the Line Manager and will be 
responsible for supporting the Participant in their first five months with the Australian Electoral 
Commission (AEC). 

The Local Induction Adviser must have the skills and knowledge to support the Participant throughout 
the National Induction Program, and is a voluntary role. Where the Local Induction Adviser believes 
that they do not have the appropriate skills and knowledge to undertake this task, they must discuss 
this with their Line Manager immediately. 

The identified Local Induction Adviser will assist the Participant in developing a positive workplace 
culture by ensuring they feel welcomed, helping them settle in and acting as the Participant’s primary 
contact on general enquiries and day to day operational issues. The Local Induction Adviser will: 

■  provide one on one training and support for the Participant on role specific activities that are in 

line with AEC procedures and legislation 

■ 

■ 

incorporate ‘why, how and when’ questions into one on one training to encourage the 
Participant to think about how activities are linked to their role or work area/branch 

follow all instructions contained in the National Induction Program modules, including guides 
and resources, ensuring a nationally consistent program is delivered 

■  use and refer the Participant to approved AEC policies and procedures only 

■  answer role specific and general enquiries questions only, escalating all other questions to 
their Line Manager, or directing the Participant to seek a response from their Line Manager 

■  be available to the Participant, responding to role specific questions as needed, ensuring the 

Participant feels comfortable to seek support

■  conduct themselves in a professional manner, supporting the AEC’s values and commitments 

throughout the induction period and beyond

refrain from voicing personal opinion or engaging in office politics with the Participant

actions that may impact the Participant’s ability to complete activities against the timeline i.e. 
sickness/absenteeism

provide evidence and/or examples to support the feedback

has or is about to be undertaken, and explain correct course of action/process 

■  provide feedback on the National Induction Program to their Line Manager and the National 

Training and Education Unit (NTEU) upon completion of each module. 

When selecting a Local Induction Adviser, the Line Manager should look for staff that have: 

■  good communication skills including the ability to listen 

■  good time management and self-management skills so that they can be available to the 

Participant 

■  a demonstrated ability to comply with the AEC’s policies and procedures, including the 

experience to be able to provide the right level of support 

■  a demonstrated history of strong performance 

■  an honest and considerate approach when it comes to providing feedback. 

The Local Induction Adviser is not responsible for any performance management, this will be the 
responsibility of the Line Manager only. Queries regarding performance, disciplinary action, or policy 
matters must be directed to the Line Manager. 

Executive Level Officer 

The Line Manager’s assigned Executive Level Officer must be engaged to ensure that expectations 
of the National Induction Program and the Participant are being met, that mandatory training is being 
completed and that the Participant is fit for the AEC prior to the probation period end date. 

The Executive Level Officer will not participate in the learning and development of the Participant 
(unless the Participant is their direct report) but will be available to the Line Manager as needed. 

The Executive Level Officer may meet with the Participant on their first day, either face to face or via 
skype, to discuss values and expectations of the agency and their state/branch. Meetings will be 
dependent on the Executive Level Officer’s time, other scheduled meetings and Participant role.
