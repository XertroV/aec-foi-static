Hi 

I hope you’ve been well. I’m looking to follow up regarding the below meeting to discuss TikTok’s on-platform 
referendum guide. I’m sorry but it’s becoming slightly more challenging for us to hold the meeting on Monday 19 
June. Happy to discuss suitable other times with you, but I’ve tentatively flagged Wednesday 28 June at 11:15am as 
a possible alternative. I appreciate the work on your end to organise the meeting, if you can let me know if this time 
suits that would be much appreciated.  

Additionally, regarding TSET, can you confirm if the new system is replacing the Law Enforcement Request Form?  

Many thanks for you help. 
Kind regards,

Hi 

Thanks for your email. I’ve spoken with the AEC’s Media and Digital Engagement team, and we’re wondering if 
Monday 19 June at 10:00am would be a suitable time to meet and discuss TikTok’s on-platform referendum guide?  

Additionally, as you may be aware, the Speaker of the House of Representatives recently announced that a by-
election, for the federal electoral division of Fadden, has been called with voting day to be held on Saturday 15 July 
2023. The Electoral Integrity Assurance Taskforce will again provide assurance to the Australian Electoral 
Commissioner, and the Australian public, on the integrity of this electoral event. Hoping you can confirm that 
TikTok’s Safety Enforcement Tool (TSET) is the best pathway should we need to refer content and that 
eiat@aec.gov.au, socialmedia@aec.gov.au and authorisationsection@aec.gov.au have been whitelisted to access 
the tool?

When we last spoke on the phone, you offered to facilitate a short meeting between the AEC and your Trust and 
Safety team for a brief tutorial on how to use TSET. We’d be interested in taking you up on this offer and wondering 
if Thursday 15 June at 11am would work for your team?  

Happy to discuss these meetings further.  

Kind regards,

Hi 

Hoping you’re well and thank you for acknowledging receipt of our Regulatory Law teams letter 
week.

Recently, we received confirmation that you’ve transitioned to TikTok's Safety Enforcement Tool (TSET). I’m looking 
to confirm if socialmedia@aec.gov.au, authorisations@aec.gov.au, and eiat@aec.gov.au are the AEC emails with 
access the tool?  

Happy to discuss if you have any questions or concerns.

Thanks and kind regards,
