 query [SEC=OFFICIAL]

Hi all – draft response for consideration below.

SUGGESTED MEDIA RESPONSE

The AEC hasn’t run a trial referendum campaign using Tik Tok, nor is there any plan to do so.

As with all national electoral events, the AEC will run a multi-channel advertising campaign to
help people fulfil their right and responsibility to vote at the referendum.

We’re still in planning stage and working with Universal McCann on the channel mix.
