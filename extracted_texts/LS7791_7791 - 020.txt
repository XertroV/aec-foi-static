Registration of The Women"s Party
Sunday, 27 January 2019 12:13:08 PM

Please help stop a TIM registering 'The Women's Party' by sending an email.

fad@aec.gov.au

I'd like to formally oppose this party being registered. The Women's Party exists in many
countries as a Radical Feminist Party. This is being registered as a non-feminist party. The
registration is an act of sabotage of grassroots feminist work and it prevents the formation
of a strong Women's Party operating in Australia.

This is a political sabotage and I ask you to reject it.

Kind Regards
