Analysis of Indigenous Enrolment 

Population Estimates 

The ABS data provided at table 1 represents the ABS estimated resident Indigenous population 1=8 
years and over by state as at 2016 and projected to 30 June 2019. 

This data has not been adjusted by the ABS to calculate estimated Indigenous enrolment eligible 
population, however, table 2 provides the AEC’s estimated Indigenous voting age population as at 30 
June 2018.

As Australia’s federal electoral roll does not have a personal Indigenous identifier, estimating the 
enrolment rates for Indigenous persons is problematic, however, having this key franchise KPI for 
the Indigenous population is important for Closing the Gap purposes and the AECs focus on how the 
franchise could be better delivered. 

In 2014 the AEC’s Research Section commenced indirect estimation of these figures, using a 
regression model of the relationship between the Indigenous population and each of the three 
franchise KPIs at a small area level, such as polling place catchment or the ABS’ SA2 geography. 

While the models did not fit the data particularly well, the resulting Indigenous enrolment rates 
were statistically based on real data, rather than anecdote. Yet the resulting enrolment and turnout 
rates in particular were alarmingly low, and hopefully represented a worst case picture. 

As part of the Annual Roll Integrity Review (ARIR), the person-level matching between the Roll and 
Centrelink now includes Centrelink’s Indigenous indicator. However, as Centrelink customers 
represent only around half of the Roll, the matching (even if perfect) would be far from assigning all 
enrolments an Indigenous flag. Nevertheless, for the first time the AEC has a very large number of 
enrolled persons, over 6 million, with an explicit Indigenous status. 

The enrolment rate, even for all persons regardless of indigeneity, is difficult to calculate reliably due 
to conceptual, collection and methodological differences between the Roll (numerator) and the ABS-
based enrolment-eligible population (denominator, “EEP”). In the case of the Indigenous population

--- Page 3 ---

these problems are magnified by having no Indigenous identifier on the Roll and less reliable 
estimates of Indigenous EEP.  

However, matching the Roll to Centrelink data allows a more direct method of estimating the 
Indigenous enrolment rate. 

It is still subject to quite courageous assumptions, but as fewer are required it likely represents an 
improved approach. In summary: 

  For all Centrelink customers with an identified Indigenous or non-Indigenous status, 

calculate the proportion on the Roll. This is the raw enrolment rate of Centrelink clients. 
  Calculate the ratio of the actual AEC enrolment rate versus the Centrelink-based rate, for the 
same point in time. This is the overall factor to adjust any Centrelink-based rates to align 
with AEC enrolment rates. 

  Apply the adjustment factor to raw Centrelink-based enrolment rates by Indigenous status 

to give Indigenous and non-Indigenous enrolment rates. 

  This process can be done at the State level, though results will have lower reliability. 

It should be noted that while this method avoids indirectly modelling Indigenous enrolment rates via 
geographic association, it does assume that any bias in Centrelink clients being enrolled is equal for 
Indigenous and non-Indigenous, and that there are no substantive Indigenous-status biases inherent 
in the Roll-to-Centrelink person matching. 

The Centrelink client file with Indigenous indicator newly available to the AEC has presented an 
excellent opportunity, via matching to the Roll and mark-off data, to improve estimation of 
Indigenous franchise KPIs.  

While the results are subject to a number of non-trivial assumptions, the more direct estimation 
methods lead to a higher likelihood of robust results. The figures should nevertheless still be 
regarded as indicative only.

Centrelink Data 
The number of Indigenous Australians that are identified both on the Centrelink file sent to the AEC 
in July 2018 and the electoral Roll does not represent all Indigenous enrolments. It is limited to those 
Indigenous Australians who both receive a Centrelink benefit and who have self-identified as 
Indigenous to Centrelink. 

After considerable data cleansing and analysis the AEC identified 72,451 potentially unenrolled 
Indigenous Australians. This represents around 61 per cent of the 118,581 Indigenous Australians 
the AEC estimate were unenrolled as at 30 June 2018 (see table 2 above).  

The enrolment stimulation event conducted in February/March 2019 resulted in the enrolment of 
2,646 Indigenous Australians, reducing the estimated number of unenrolled Indigenous Australians 
identified in the Centrelink dataset to 69,143. Table 3 sets out the distribution of this cohort across 
electoral divisions.  

It is important to note that the potential unenrolled under 65 Indigenous Australians as at the 2019 
close of rolls represents those people that are on the Centrelink file sent to the AEC in July 2018 and 
who were included in the February 2019 enrolment stimulation event but had not enrolled as at the 
2019 close of rolls (18 April 2019).  

Analysis of the Centrelink potentially unenrolled Indigenous Australians 65 years and older identified 
significant matching error, due to the quality of data input and the nature of the residential status of 
this cohort. Work will be undertaken on the 2018-19 dataset to better understand this phenomenon 
to facilitate better targeting of potentially unenrolled indigenous Australians in the future.
