RE: AEC Engagement for the next Federal Election [SEC=OFFICIAL]

I’m Anna, I work with Julie and she has asked me to come back to you on this one. Current availability in the 
proposed weeks is: 

•  Thursday 24 June – available from 1-2pm 
•  Friday 25 June – available from 1-2pm 
•  Thursday 1 July – available from 11am-12pm 

These are particularly busy calendars (as I am sure yours are too), so hopeful that we can finalise a date as soon as 
possible. 

Thank you! 

Kind regards,

Hi Jule, 

Good to chat on the phone yesterday.  I caught up with our Government Affairs and 
Public Policy team and they are happy to meet over the coming weeks.  I'll also 
bring our marketing and Comms / PR teams too.  Can you let me know some times 
that work for you w/c 21st and 28th June.

Good Afternoon 

,  

I am writing to follow up on the below meeting invitation on behalf of the AEC and Electoral Integrity 
Assurance Taskforce.  

It would be fantastic if we could put some time in the diary in the next month to formally begin our 
collaboration in advance of the next federal election.  

Kind regards,  

Julie
