Objection to The Women"s Party being registeted.
Sunday, 27 January 2019 9:16:12 AM

I would formally like to stop this party being registered.The Women's Party exists in many
countries as a Radical Feminist Party.This is being registered as a non-feminist party
which will cause confusion and garner false votes .Kind regards,
