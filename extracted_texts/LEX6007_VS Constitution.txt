Victorian  Socialist  elected  MPs  shall  be  required  to  gain  the  consent  of  the

Due to the particular public role that candidates and elected MPs occupy, they will

Having properly determined to dissolve the Party, the Executive Committee must 
take immediate steps to distribute all assets of the Party in a fair and reasonable 
manner. All such assets are to be allocated to any organisation having aims and 
objectives consistent with those of the Victorian Socialists.  

The  Party  is  not  considered  to  be  dissolved  until  such  time  as  all  assets  are 
distributed in accordance with this Constitution.
