RE: RE: RE: [External] Update regarding election content and postal rules [SEC=OFFICIAL]

Thanks 

 and no problem.  

Can you please confirm who/how many people to expect so we can prepare an appropriate room? 

I have considered what else we could cover in the meeting and would offer up the following as a rough agenda:  

- 

- 
- 
- 

FE22 Feedback, as mentioned great event for our engagement however AEC also interested in any anecdotal 
information relating to your general election observations, and for example common or emerging electoral 
themes that were raised with yourselves? Any feedback on ability to apply electoral legislation? Etc.  
Potential preventative measures and collaborative actions to consider ahead of future events  
Policy questions ahead of potential future referendum  
ECANZ working arrangements, feedback on current version to feed into upcoming reviews.  

Happy to chat ahead of Friday and keep things relatively informal if that works for yourselves?  

Re. Victoria State election: I will double check the contact I have in mind is still best placed and let you know in the 
coming days.  

Kind regards

Certainly happy to do a post-election debrief though I do want to note it was actually fairly uneventful for our 
platform (a good thing) so we might not have an overwhelming amount of things to speak to from our end. 

On state elections - we have a good existing relationship with the electoral authority in NSW but would certainly 
appreciate an introduction to the Victorian Government. 

Thanks!

Thanks 

We can get some time at 1.30pm with the team. We have a large room here at AEC, so please fwd invite as 
necessary.  

Looking at a basic agenda - Would be great to use our time for a post-election debrief. Happy to touch on the 
Statement of intent in a review sense, however I note the broader state and territory electoral commissioners are 
meeting mid-July so I will have a lot more after this on the way forward.  

What in particular are you looking for in terms of upcoming state/territory elections? Happy to put you in touch with 
the relevant teams at the other commissions? 

Cheers

Hi 

Hope you have been well and had a chance to rest since the election. 

The TikTok Public Policy team will be in Canberra 1 July, and I was wondering whether it would be an opportune 
time for us to have a post-election catch up and potentially discuss the Statement of Intent and upcoming state 
elections.  

As you are aware we have been working closely with 
with everyone together but I thought I would reach out to you first. 

team and the EIIF as well, so we'd be happy to meet 

Let me know your thoughts! 

Kind regards
