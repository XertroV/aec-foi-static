Finance and Public Administration Committee from 11:15am-2:00pm. Follow on ParlWatch. Yesterday, Shadow Attorney-General Mark Dreyfus (Isaacs, Vic, ALP) spoke on political donations, referencing donations by Canstruct executives to the Liberal National Party. The final report of JSCEM’s review of the FAD Reform Act was also presented. The report makes no recommendations, observing that the legislation is working effectively. JSCEM Member James Stevens (Sturt SA, LP) said: “It is clear from the evidence provided to this inquiry that, after an initial transition period, the act in its current form is working appropriately and not hindering the current activities of charitable based organisations. It is very positive that many members of the sector report that their organisations have gained familiarity with the definitions and find them workable. The committee notes there are a variety of conflicting views about possible amendments, but this reflects diverse interest from observers of the political system and is not suggestive of fundamental structural problems.” – StevensHouse of RepresentativesChamber documents:        Votes and Proceedings – Thursday 27 May 2021        Hansard – Thursday 27 May 2021SenateEstimates:Consolidated programAEC appearance: Webcast (from 16:03) | Hansard (Not yet published)JSCEMCurrent inquiries:        Future conduct of elections operating during times of emergency situations Completed inquiries:        Review of the FAD Reform Act – Final report  Jake Farquharson and Bronwen WilliamsonParliamentary Engagement and Party Registration Section | Disclosure, Assurance and Engagement BranchAustralian Electoral CommissionT: (02) 6271 4582 X: 21410 (Jake, A/g Parliamentary Advisor)T: (02) 6271 4705 X: 25007 (Bronwen, A/g Parliamentary Support)
