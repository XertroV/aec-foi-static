Enquiry details

I'm suggesting that the application to register  The Women's Party" (in the 
name of Divvi de Vendre (who is a man btw)) should be looked at carefully 
regarding his intent. I suggest it is for the purpose of misleading less-
politically savvy females into voting for what they may think is a feminist-
based party (which it most certainly  sn't) and for disseminating anti-woman 
propaganda.
