Dear 

I draw to your attention the website www.votetonyout.com which is selling a range of merchandise in the context of 
the forthcoming federal election. 

In particular, the merchandise features messages calling for voters to vote out the Liberal candidate for Warringah, 
Tony Abbott, and alternatively supporting the independent candidate, Zali Steggall. 

I note that neither the website, nor the merchandise being sold through the website (that requires authorisation), 
contains the required particulars in accordance with Part XXA of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 (‘the Act’).   

According to a search of ASIC records of the ABN listed on the website 
OUT was registered on 5/04/2019 to a 

 of 

 the business VOTE TONY 

. 

I would ask that the AEC investigates this breach of the Act and take appropriate action if warranted.
