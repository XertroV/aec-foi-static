Hi 

Thursday, 16 February 2023 9:30 AM

AEC/EIAT contact details [SEC=OFFICIAL]

Wonderful to meet you yesterday and very much looking forward to collaborating in the lead up to the referendum.  
Shortly I’ll be sending through a follow up email to the Google team confirming a few action items from yesterday’s 
meeting – apologies for the slight delay on this!  

Thanks for your offer to share your phone number, unfortunately I’m having a little trouble locating it so I’d be 
grateful if you could share it with me again? As I’ll be your main point of contact for the AEC, I also wanted to pass 
on mine, 
, please feel free to call or email with any questions or concerns, always very happy to help 
and get you the best information possible.  
For emails that are of significance or urgent, I’d recommend either sending them to or CCing in EIAT@aec.gov.au so 
others in the Defending Democracy Unit (DDU) can assist if I’m unavailable.  

Looking forward to speaking with you more over the coming months.  

Kind regards,
