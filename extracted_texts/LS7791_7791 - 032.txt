Objection to the Women’s Party
Sunday, 10 February 2019 4:32:28 PM

I am lodging an objection to the naming of the Women’s Party under
Section 129 of the Australian Electoral Act.
My objections are as follows:

I object to the name Women’s Party on the grounds that it is based on
notions of gender rather than that of biological sex and therefore
excludes women born women.
The term Women’s Party cannot be inclusive of all women when the
registered officer of the party is Divvi De Vendre, a transgender born
male.
