Hi 

Hope you're having a good week.  

I can confirm the alias is correct and is up and running to support the by election.

The answer in all likelihood is yes, but let me confirm with my colleagues and get back to you.

Not a problem 
While I have you, as you may be aware, the Speaker of the House of Representatives recently announced that a by-
election for the federal electoral division of Fadden will be held on 15 July 2023. 
Voting day will take place on Saturday 15 July 2023.

Further to our discussion earlier this year on the referendum and the visit by the EIAT delegation to Redmon in a 
couple of weeks’ time, I hoped the AEC could assist with providing some information to assist in Microsoft’s efforts 
to combat dis- and misinformation on our services. 
In particular, we hoped to have a list of common misinformation narratives the AEC is observing. This will enable us 
to put appropriate measures in place to support the integrity of the information ecosystem. 
I understand AEC plans to have a misinformation register, as during the federal election, but in the meantime, I 
would welcome your advice on current trends, as well as your thoughts on how we can access and update this 
information as the campaign progresses throughout the year. 
Please feel free to give me a call if easier to discussion. 
With many thanks
