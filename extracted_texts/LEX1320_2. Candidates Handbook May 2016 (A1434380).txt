About this handbook

Are you thinking of standing or assisting someone to stand for election to the Commonwealth 
Parliament in either a federal election or a by-election? If so, you will need a clear understanding of 
the legislative requirements you must meet, and of your role and responsibilities under the law.

Remember, you and your supporters can play a significant role in helping to ensure, as far as 
possible, that every vote cast in an election counts.

The Candidates Handbook

This handbook is published by the Australian 
Electoral Commission (AEC), the Commonwealth 
agency which maintains the electoral roll and 
conducts federal elections, by-elections and 
referendums. The handbook covers the stages 
for the electoral process relevant to candidates.

Each chapter in the handbook lists the relevant 
parts of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 
(the Act), detailing how the electoral law applies 
to candidates and those assisting them.

The AEC suggests that you consult the 
Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act 
(the Constitution), the Act and other legislation, 
including the Referendum (Machinery Provisions) 
Act 1984 referred to for the exact provisions.

Candidates must satisfy themselves about their 
own legal position and, if necessary, refer to the 
exact provisions of the Constitution and the Act, 
and consult their own lawyers.

You can access this handbook, the Constitution 
and the Act via the AEC website.

Offences relating to the election, whether they 
occur before or during the election, are listed in 
Appendix 1. Some electoral offences apply at all 
times, while others apply to specific periods.

The AEC can assist you by providing information 
of a general nature about the nomination 
process and campaign activity. However, we 
cannot provide you with formal or informal 
legal advice.

Abbreviations and acronyms have been kept to a 
minimum. However, seven are used throughout 
this handbook:

 ■ AEC – Australian Electoral Commission

 ■ AEO – Australian Electoral Officer

 ■ ARO – Assistant Returning Officer

 ■ DRO – Divisional Returning Officer

 ■ the Act – Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918

 ■ HoR – House of Representatives

 ■ CSS – the Central Senate Scrutiny

The words ‘voter’ and ‘elector’ are used 
interchangeably.

At the end of this handbook you will find a 
glossary which explains terms that may be 
unfamiliar to you.

How this handbook can help you

The handbook explains the steps you will need 
to take to qualify as a candidate and to comply 
with the law before, during and after an election.

At the end of this introductory section you will 
find a checklist that takes you through important 
details you will need to know and the activities 
you will need to undertake as a candidate, and 
indicates where in the handbook you can find 
more information.

Again, the handbook is intended to assist 
candidates standing for election by explaining 
relevant processes and procedures. It is not, 
however, a substitute for the law.

You need to be aware that many of the 
documents you submit in relation to your 
candidacy will be made available for public 
inspection. These include your nomination form 
and your financial disclosure return. Exceptions 
may apply in certain circumstances.

AEC website

Because information can change during the life 
of a publication, the AEC website is the best 
source of up-to-date information.

What’s new at this election?

Changes to Senate voting that will 
apply at this election 

The Parliament has recently passed legislative 
changes to the voting method for electing 
Senators. 

The changes impact on how voters complete 
their Senate ballot paper and how the Senate 
ballot papers are counted.

These changes are explained in detail below in 
the section on Ballot Papers.

Counting of Senate votes

The counting of Senate votes will also be 
different.

As a result of the recent changes passed by the 
Parliament, the scrutiny of Senate votes will be 
carried out by the AEO at the CSS centre in each 
State or Territory.

On polling night, at each polling place, the 
ARO is required to count the total number of 
Senate ballot papers and the number of first 
preferences above the line (ATL). It is AEC policy 
for the ARO to also count the number of first 
preferences below the line (BTL) for each group 
and ungrouped candidate and to also count the 
obviously informal ballot papers. 

After polling day, the DRO repeats the count 
process undertaken by the ARO before 
forwarding the ballot papers to the CSS.

This means that while ballot papers where a 
first preference cannot be determined will be 
separated from those where it can, it is only 
the AEO who determines formality. The AEO 
will be assisted in determining formality by a 
computerised scrutiny process.

Scrutineers have the opportunity to object to the 
formality of a Senate ballot paper at the CSS.

Political party logos

HoR and Senate ballot papers will look different 
at this election. Political parties that have 
registered a logo with the AEC before the issue 
of writs for the election can request to have their 
party logo printed on the ballot papers. The 
inclusion of a party logo is intended to reduce 
the confusion that may arise where political 
parties have similar names.

Handling of declaration votes

A further change arising from the recent Senate 
reforms relates to the handling of declaration 
votes.

Declaration vote ballot boxes will no longer be 
opened at polling locations. Instead they will 
remain sealed and transported to a divisional 
outpost where they will be stored securely until 
they can then be opened, fully reconciled and 
the declaration vote envelopes within forwarded 
to the relevant DRO for processing.

Candidates Handbook 2016

Usually the House of Representatives and the 
half Senate elections are held at the same time. 
However, the Governor-General may dissolve 
both Houses simultaneously upon certain 
conditions having been met under section 57 of 
the Constitution, resulting in a general election 
for the House of Representatives and all of the 
Senate. This is known as a double dissolution.

The key dates in the election timetable are 
available on the AEC website.

By-elections

Whenever a vacancy occurs in the House 
of Representatives because of the death, 
resignation, absence without leave, expulsion, 
disqualification or ineligibility of a member, a writ 
may be issued for the election of a new member. 
A writ may also be issued when the Court of 
Disputed Returns declares an election void.

The guiding principle in fixing the date of a by-
election has always been to hold the election 
as early as possible so that the electors are not 
left without representation any longer than is 
necessary.

Feedback welcome

The AEC welcomes your views on the usefulness 
of the Candidates Handbook and any specific 
information provided in these pages. We invite 
you to send your feedback via the AEC website.

The AEC also publishes Electoral Backgrounders 
on specific aspects of electoral law. Copies of 
these AEC publications can be accessed by 
visiting the AEC website or by phoning 13 23 26.

Timing of the election

Federal elections

The constitutional and legislative frameworks that 
govern Australian federal elections determine 
both the election timetable and electoral 
processes.

Both Houses of Parliament have separate 
provisions reflecting their different constitutional 
roles. A House of Representatives term expires 
three years from its first official meeting, but can 
be dissolved earlier. Once the term expires or is 
dissolved, the Governor-General will issue the 
writs for an election.

The Senate is a continuing body with senators 
for each state elected for a six-year term. A 
rotation system ensures that half the Senate 
is retired or up for election every three years. 
Two senators represent the Australian Capital 
Territory and two senators represent the 
Northern Territory. These senators are elected 
concurrently with the members of the House of 
Representatives. The duration of their term of 
office also coincides with the members of the 
House of Representatives.

The writ

The Act

Part VIII, ‘Enrolment’

Part XIII, ‘Writs for elections’

Part XIX, ‘The return of the writs’

The issue of a writ triggers the election process and provides the opportunity for you to nominate as 
a candidate. The writ is the legal document necessary for the official timetable and process for the 
election to begin.

Issue of the writ

The Constitution, s.12 and s.32 
The Act, s.151 and s.152

Senate

The Constitution, s.12 
The Act, s.151 and s.153

The issuing of the writs triggers the election 
process. The writs are deemed to be issued at 
6pm on the day they are issued.

The writs must be issued within 10 days from the 
expiry of the House of Representatives or from 
the proclamation of a dissolution of the House 
of Representatives. If the Senate is dissolved, 
the writs must be issued within 10 days of 
dissolution.

House of Representatives

The Constitution, s.32 and s.33 
The Act, s.154

The Governor-General issues the writs for a 
general election of members of the House of 
Representatives. They are addressed to the 
Electoral Commissioner, who advises each 
Divisional Returning Officer (DRO) of the dates 
specified in the writs and directs them to make 
election arrangements.

Eight writs are issued for each general election of 
the House of Representatives: one in each state 
and one each for the Australian Capital Territory 
and Northern Territory.

The writ for the election of senators for a state 
is issued by the governor of the state and is 
addressed to the Australian Electoral Officer 
(AEO) for that particular state. The writ for the 
election of senators for a territory is issued by the 
Governor-General and is addressed to the AEO 
for that particular territory.

Dates fixed in the writ

The Act, s.152 and s.154

The writ specifies the key dates of an election 
in accordance with the legislated election 
timetable. These dates specify the timing for the 
close of the rolls, the close of nominations, the 
election day and the return of the writ.

The AEC advertises these dates within major 
newspapers circulating in each state and territory 
and on the AEC website. An indicative election 
timetable is shown on page 11.

Close of rolls

The Act, s.102 and s.155

The rolls close at 8pm on the seventh day after 
the date of the issue of the writ.

Candidates Handbook 2016 

9


--- Page 10 ---

Close of nominations

The Act, s.156

The date for the close of nominations is set out in 
the writ. It must be at least 10 days, but not more 
than 27 days, after the date of issue of the writ. 
You can nominate as a candidate during AEC 
business hours any time after the writ is issued 
up to 12 noon on the day nominations close. The 
Act strictly prescribes where you must submit 
your nomination form and deposit. Nominations 
cannot be accepted under any circumstances if 
those requirements are not met.

Declaration of nominations

The Act, s.175 and s.176

Nominations are publicly declared 24 hours after 
they close. Your nomination form will be made 
available for public inspection at this time.

Election day

The Act, s.157 and s.158

Election day is set out in the writ. It must be 
between 23 and 31 days after the close of 
nominations. Election day must be a Saturday.

Return of writ  
and declaration of the poll

The Act, s.152, s.159, s.283 and s.284

Each writ for an election must be returned on or 
before the date fixed for its return, which must be 
within 100 days of its issue.

In a House of Representatives election or by-
election, the DRO of each division will, as soon 
as practicable after it has been determined 
that a candidate has been elected, publicly 
declare the name of the elected candidate. 
After all votes have been counted the DRO 
prepares a statement setting out the result of the 
election. This statement is sent to the Electoral 
Commissioner.

After receiving a statement of results from every 
DRO, the Electoral Commissioner endorses 
the name of each candidate elected for each 
electoral division in the state or territory on a 
certificate and attaches it to the relevant writ. 
The Electoral Commissioner then returns the 
writs to the Governor-General or to the Speaker 
in the case of a by-election.

In a Senate election the AEO, as soon as 
convenient after the election result has been 
determined, publicly declares the result of 
the election and the names of the candidates 
elected. The AEO then returns the writ to the 
governor of the state or, in the case of the 
territories, to the Governor-General.

Meeting of parliament

The Constitution, s.5

The new parliament meets within 30 days of the 
day appointed for the return of the writs.

The table below provides an indication of 
the election period timetable from the time 
of the expiry or dissolution of the House of 
Representatives. The actual timetable will be 
published on the AEC website after the writs are 
issued for an election.

Part XIV, ‘The nominations’

The Constitution

s.43 and s.44

Candidates can nominate anytime from the issue

explains the nomination process, including:

Who can nominate as a 
candidate?

The Act, s.163 and s.164, the Constitution s.43

The qualifications for nominating as a candidate 
for the House of Representatives or the Senate 
are the same. To nominate for election to either 
the House of Representatives or the Senate, you 
must be:

 ■ at least 18 years old,

 ■ an Australian citizen, and

 ■ either enrolled or eligible to be enrolled on the 

Commonwealth electoral roll.

A member of the House of Representatives or 
Senate cannot be chosen or sit as a member of 
the other House of Parliament.

You cannot nominate for the House of 
Representatives or Senate if you:

 ■ are currently a member of a state parliament 

or a territory legislative assembly and have not 
resigned before the hour of nomination (i.e. 
12 noon on the day nominations close). As 
state and territory laws govern the manner of 
resignation, intending candidates should make 
sure their resignations are effective before the 
hour of nomination.

 ■ are disqualified by section 44 of the 

Constitution.

 ■ information about who is qualified to 

nominate,

 ■ important issues relating to the timing of 

nominations, and

 ■ different rules for single and bulk nominations.

For your nomination to be accepted you must 
pay a nomination deposit in the approved format 
and properly complete and sign the nomination 
form.

You are encouraged to lodge your nomination as 
early as possible within the specified timeframe.

Further information on nominations can be found 
on the AEC website.

Candidate briefing sessions

Candidate briefing sessions are held by state 
and divisional offices before and after the 
close of nominations to provide candidates 
with information about the polling process and 
to outline their rights and responsibilities as a 
candidate in an election. Candidates may attend 
themselves or send a representative. At these 
sessions, information packs containing a variety 
of materials will be available.

For information on dates and time of briefing 
sessions:

 ■ candidates for the House of Representatives 
should contact the division for which they are 
nominating.

 ■ candidates for the Senate should contact the 
relevant AEC state office in the state where 
they are nominating as a candidate.

Candidates Handbook 2016

Disqualification under the 
Constitution

Section 44 of the Constitution disqualifies certain 
people from being elected to the Commonwealth 
Parliament. Section 44 of the Constitution is 
reproduced below.

44. Any person who –

i. 

ii. 

is under any acknowledgment of allegiance, 
obedience, or adherence to a foreign power, 
or is a subject or a citizen or entitled to the 
rights or privileges of a subject or a citizen of 
a foreign power; or

is attainted of treason, or has been convicted 
and is under sentence, or subject to be 
sentenced, for any offence punishable under 
the law of the Commonwealth or of a State 
by imprisonment for one year or longer; or

iii. 

is an undischarged bankrupt or insolvent; or

iv.  holds any office of profit under the Crown, or 
any pension payable during the pleasure of 
the Crown out of any of the revenues of the 
Commonwealth; or

v.  has any direct or indirect pecuniary interest 
in any agreement with the Public Service 
of the Commonwealth otherwise than as 
a member and in common with the other 
members of an incorporated company 
consisting of more than twenty-five persons; 

vi.  shall be incapable of being chosen or of 
sitting as a senator or a member of the 
House of Representatives.

But subsection (iv) does not apply to the office 
of any of the Queen’s Ministers of State for 
the Commonwealth, or of any of the Queen’s 
Ministers for a State, or to the receipt of pay, half-
pay, or a pension, by any person as an officer 
or member of the Queen’s navy or army, or to 
the receipt of pay as an officer or member of the 
naval or military forces of the Commonwealth 
by any person whose services are not wholly 
employed by the Commonwealth.

The Act, s.36

No candidate may be appointed as an electoral 
officer of any description, either as a permanent 
officer or as a polling official. If an electoral officer 
becomes a candidate, they must vacate the 
office.

For more information see the Electoral 
Backgrounder on Constitutional Disqualifications 
and Intending Candidates, which is available on 
the AEC website or from AEC national and state 
offices.

‘Office of profit’ disqualification

In its November 1992 decision in the case of 
Sykes v. Cleary, the High Court voided the 
election of Mr Phil Cleary as member of the 
House of Representatives for the Division of 
Wills. Mr Cleary was disqualified from being 
chosen as a member under section 44(iv) of the 
Constitution on the grounds that, as a Victorian 
state school teacher on leave without pay, he 
held an ‘office of profit’ under the Crown. This 
case has been approved in subsequent High 
Court applications.

If you are a Commonwealth, state or territory 
public servant and wish to nominate for election 
to the Commonwealth Parliament, you should 
resign before nomination in order to comply 
with the Constitution. Conditions of re-entry 
to the various public services by unsuccessful 
candidates are matters for the relevant public 
service authority.

Commonwealth public servants who resign to 
contest an election and who are unsuccessful 
may apply for re-appointment or re-engagement 
under section 32 of the Public Service Act 1999. 
A former officer or former temporary employee 
is required to be re-appointed or re-engaged 
subject to certain conditions.

Most states and territories have comparable 
statutory or administrative provisions. The 
position of local government employees is not 
clear and it might be that such persons are 
vulnerable to the office of profit disqualification. 
Section 327(3) of the Act provides some 
protection for local government employees who 
become, are, or have been candidates. If you are 
a local government employee you should check 
with the relevant authorities before resigning or 
nominating.

The Constitutional disqualification on the 
ground of ‘office of profit’ applies to permanent 
members of the Australian Defence Force 

Candidates Handbook 2016 

13


--- Page 14 ---

(ADF). If you are a member of the ADF you 
should consult the relevant Defence authority on 
conditions of resignation and re-entry.

‘Foreign allegiance’ disqualification

In the Sykes v. Cleary decision the High 
Court also commented on the ‘foreign 
allegiance’ disqualification in section 44(i) of 
the Constitution. The majority view of the Court 
was that naturalised Australian citizens who 
also have foreign citizenship and are standing 
as candidates should take ‘reasonable steps to 
renounce foreign nationality’. The steps to take 
for renunciation may depend upon foreign law. 
If you have foreign citizenship you should check 
with the relevant embassy or high commission 
about the procedures for renouncing it.

In the case of Sue v. Hill in June 1999 the High 
Court decided that Ms Heather Hill was not duly 
elected as a senator for Queensland at the 1998 
federal election because she was disqualified 
under section 44(i) of the Constitution. Ms Hill 
was a British subject and an Australian citizen at 
the time of her nomination. The United Kingdom 
is regarded as a ‘foreign power’ for the purposes 
of section 44(i).

You are required to sign a declaration on the 
nomination form that you are qualified under the 
Constitution and the laws of the Commonwealth 
to be elected to the Commonwealth Parliament.

If you have any doubts as to your qualifications 
under the Constitution, the AEC recommends 
you seek your own legal advice. The AEC 
does not provide legal advice to prospective 
candidates.

When can I nominate?

You cannot nominate as a candidate until the 
writ for the election has been issued. The writ is 
deemed to have been issued at 6pm on the day 
on which it is issued. The intention to hold an 
election is often announced some days before 
the writ is issued. If you are unsure, check with 
an AEC office or visit the AEC website.

The date fixed for the close of nominations 
will be between 10 days and 27 days after the 
issue of the writ and this date is specified in the 
writ. The AEC advertises the dates from the 
writ within major newspapers circulating in the 
relevant state or territory. Also, after the election 
is announced, an election timetable as outlined 
in the writ is published on the AEC website.

You can nominate as a candidate during 
AEC business hours any time after the writ is 
issued up to 12 noon on the day nominations 
close. Single nominations for the House of 
Representatives must be lodged with the 
relevant DRO by 12 noon on the day nominations 
close. Bulk nominations of candidates 
endorsed by a political party for the House 
of Representatives must be lodged with the 
relevant AEO not less than 48 hours before the 
close of nominations. All Senate nominations 
must be lodged with the relevant AEO before the 
close of nominations.

Nominations lodged with another officer or at 
another place cannot be accepted.

You are advised to lodge your nomination before 
the day nominations close. Late nominations 
cannot be accepted under any circumstances.

Nomination forms

There are several different options when 
nominating for the House of Representatives 
or the Senate, each option using a different 
nomination form. You need to complete the 
nomination form for the relevant option, as well 
as an individual candidate details form (Form 59 
or Form 60) for each candidate nominated.

Note: for elections held on the same day, 
you can only nominate for one House of 
Representatives division, or for the Senate in only 
one state or territory. If you nominate more than 
once all your nominations will be invalid.

Blank nomination forms for the House of 
Representatives and the Senate are available 
from AEC offices or by phoning the AEC on 
13 23 26. Once the writ for the election has been 
issued, the forms will also be available on the 
AEC website.

It is against the law to include false or misleading 
information in a nomination form. Giving false 
or misleading information is a serious offence. 
In addition, you must not omit any information if 
omitting that information would be misleading. 
The maximum penalty for this offence is 
imprisonment for 12 months.

All nomination papers are publicly produced 
at declaration time (12 noon on the day after 
nominations close) and the relevant AEO or DRO 
declares the name and address of candidates 
(address details for a candidate who is a silent 
elector will not be released or declared). All other 
contact information for candidates, which they 
have indicated is not for public release, will be 
removed from a candidate’s form before it is 
produced at the time of declaration. 

Information listed for public release is also 
published on the AEC website during the 
election period. It should be remembered that 
the media and the public use this publicly 
available contact information to reach candidates 
for information about their candidature. All 
nomination forms are destroyed only after the 
next election.

Nomination by a party

The Act, s.4C, s.166 and s.169

If you are endorsed by a registered political 
party, the relevant nomination form should 
include verification of your endorsement by the 
registered officer of the party. The registered 
officer and the deputy registered officer of a 
registered political party have equal powers in 
relation to the nomination process.

If a registered officer nominates you, they may 
request on the relevant nomination form that 
the party’s registered name or abbreviation and 
registered logo be printed on the ballot paper 
next to your name. If you are part of a Senate 
group, the registered officer may request to have 
the party name or abbreviation printed next to 
the above the line box. Political parties with a 
registered logo can request to have no more 
than two logos to appear adjacent to their party 
or group name above the line on the Senate 
ballot paper.

Alternatively, the registered officer may provide 
these details in writing to the appropriate AEO or 
DRO before the close of nominations.

A registered party may not nominate more 
than one candidate for the same House of 
Representatives division.

Nomination by eligible electors

If you are not endorsed by a party you must be 
nominated by eligible electors; that is, people 
who are entitled to vote at the election for which 
you are standing.

House of Representatives nominations
The electors who nominate a House of 
Representatives candidate must be enrolled for 
the division for which the candidate is standing. 
The names, addresses and signatures of the 
electors are recorded on Form 60-c: Single 
nomination of unendorsed candidate by eligible 
electors.

Note: It is advised to obtain the names of more 
than the required number of electors in case 
after the checking process, some are found not 
to be enrolled in that division.

Candidates Handbook 2016 

16


--- Page 17 ---

The nomination must also include a statement 
of the form in which your given name is to be 
printed on the ballot paper.

For example a person enrolled as Catherine 
Citizen must complete the nomination form in 
that name. However, she may request that ‘Cate’ 
Citizen be used on the ballot paper as that is a 
commonly accepted variation of her name.

Your place of residence
If you are a ‘silent elector’, you are not required 
to set out your residential address on the 
nomination form, but you must supply the DRO 
or AEO (as appropriate) with an address. This 
address may be a postal address and it is not 
made public.

Your occupation details
The Act requires these details to be provided.

Your contact details
You must provide contact details on the 
nomination form, but you can ask that some or 
all of these details not be publicly released. 

Note: Nomination forms will be publicly produced 
at the declaration of nominations, however the 
address details for a candidate who is a silent 
elector will not be released or declared. For 
all other candidates the address details will be 
made available, however contact details which 
candidates have indicated are not for public 
release will be removed from all nomination 
forms. Information indicated as being for public 
release is also published on the AEC website. 
It should be remembered that the media and 
the public use this publicly available contact 
information to reach candidates for information 
about their candidature.

Senate nominations
The electors who nominate a Senate candidate 
must be enrolled for the state or territory for 
which the candidate is standing. The names, 
addresses and signatures of the electors are 
recorded on Form 59-e: Single nomination by 
eligible electors.

Note: It is advised to obtain the names of more 
than the required number of electors in case 
after the checking process, some are found not 
to be enrolled in that state or territory.

The Public Access Terminal at any AEC divisional 
office can be used to check names for enrolment 
details prior to submitting your nomination.

You should not leave lodging your nomination to 
the last minute as any defects in your nomination 
cannot be corrected after the nominations 
deadline.

Personal information

When nominating for either the House of 
Representatives or the Senate, you must set out 
the following personal information on the relevant 
nomination form:

 ■ Form 60: Nomination of a Member of the 

House of Representatives, or

 ■ Form 59: Nomination of a Senator.

Your name
Your name must be specified on the form and 
must include either:

 ■ your surname or family name and one or 

more of the given names under which you are 
enrolled, or

 ■ if you are not enrolled, a surname or family 
name and one or more of the given names 
under which you are entitled to be enrolled.

A given name may be specified by either:

 ■ an initial standing for that name, or

 ■ a commonly accepted variation of that name 

(including an abbreviation or truncation of that 
name or an alternative form of that name).

Candidates Handbook 2016

--- Page 18 ---

Declaration

Bulk nominations

You must sign a declaration on the nomination 
form that you:

 ■ are an Australian citizen,

 ■ are at least 18 years of age,

 ■ are an elector or qualified to be an elector,

 ■ are qualified under the Constitution and other 

laws of the Commonwealth,

 ■ are not and do not intend to be a candidate in 

any other election on the same day, and

 ■ consent to act if elected.

Electoral officers are not generally empowered 
to question, challenge or provide advice on the 
declaration made by an intending candidate on 
the nomination form.

House of Representatives 
nominations

A person can nominate for election to the House 
of Representatives as a candidate endorsed by 
a registered political party or as an unendorsed 
candidate.

The registered officer of a registered political 
party may make a bulk nomination of all the 
party’s endorsed House of Representatives 
candidates for a particular state or territory at 
one time. Political parties with a registered logo 
can request to have their party logo appear 
adjacent to their candidate names on the House 
of Representatives ballot paper.

A candidate may have the word ‘Independent’ 
printed beside their name when nominating as 
an independent candidate.

If you are an incumbent member of the House 
of Representatives and you were elected as 
an unendorsed candidate at your previous 
election, and you are not endorsed by a 
registered political party, then Form 60-c: Single 
nomination of unendorsed candidate need 
only be signed by one person (other than the 
candidate) entitled to vote at the election.

Each of the candidates included in a bulk 
nomination must complete a separate copy of 
Form 60: Nomination of a Member of the House 
of Representatives.

Bulk nominations must be received by the AEO 
for the relevant state or territory not less than 48 
hours before the close of nominations.

If a party chooses to lodge a bulk nomination, 
it must include all the House of Representatives 
candidates that the party is endorsing for the 
particular state or territory.

If a party lodges a bulk nomination and a single 
nomination for a candidate endorsed by the 
same party is also lodged, the bulk nomination 
of all that party’s candidates will be invalidated. 
This applies whether the candidate was included 
in the bulk nomination or not.

If a candidate who was included in a bulk 
nomination withdraws or dies after the cut-
off date for bulk nominations and before the 
close of nominations, the nomination of the 
other candidates in the bulk nomination is not 
affected. The registered officer may substitute 
a new candidate at any time before the close of 
nominations.

Senate nominations

A candidate nominating for election to the 
Senate may be endorsed by a registered political 
party or may nominate as an unendorsed 
candidate.

Unendorsed candidates may nominate 
individually or as part of a group with other 
unendorsed candidates.

Nominating as a Senate candidate

When nominating endorsed candidates the 
registered officer:

 ■ must nominate endorsed party candidates, or 

verify a candidate’s party endorsement,

 ■ must specify the ballot paper order of the 

candidates’ names in the group,

Candidates Handbook 2016 

18


--- Page 19 ---

■ may request that the party name or 

abbreviation appear beside a candidate’s 
name on the ballot paper, 

 ■ may request that the party logo be printed 

on the ballot paper if it has one entered in the 
Register of Political Parties, and

 ■ may request that the name of the party 

be printed on the ballot paper beside the 
group voting square. Alternatively if the 
candidates are endorsed by more than one 
party, the registered officer may request that 
a composite name of the party names or 
abbreviations be printed beside the group 
voting square.

When nominating as an unendorsed group 
using Form 59-c, the candidates specify the 
ballot paper order of the candidates’ names in 
the group.

Each candidate in a group nomination must 
make a request on their nomination form for their 
name to be included in a group on the Senate 
ballot paper. They must complete an individual 
copy of Form 59: Nomination of a Senator and 
if the candidates is not endorsed also complete 
Form 59-c: Group of unendorsed candidates 
and Form 59-e: Nomination by 100 electors.

Grouped candidates not endorsed by a political 
party cannot have the word ‘Independent’ 
printed next to their names or against their box 
above the line.

A candidate may have the word ‘Independent’ 
printed beside their name on the ballot paper 
when nominating as an ungrouped (single) and 
unendorsed candidate.

The Act, s.166(1C)

If you are an incumbent senator and you were 
elected as an unendorsed candidate at your 
previous election, and you are not endorsed by a 
registered political party, then Form 59-e: Single 
nomination need only be signed by one person 
(other than the candidate) entitled to vote at the 
election.

Nomination deposit

Each nomination for the House of 
Representatives and the Senate must be 
accompanied by a deposit paid by legal 
tender (cash) or a cheque drawn by a bank or 
other financial institution on itself. Cheques for 
nomination deposits should be made out to the 
Australian Electoral Commission. Money orders, 
electronic funds transfers, credit cards, personal 
cheques and other business cheques cannot be 
accepted.

A deposit is required for each House of 
Representatives candidate and for each Senate 
candidate.

For bulk nominations both the nomination form 
and the deposit must be received not less than 
48 hours before the close of nominations.

For other nominations both the nomination form 
and deposit must be received before 12 noon on 
the day nominations close.

Return of deposit

The deposit for a House of Representatives 
candidate will be returned to the person who 
paid it or someone authorised by that person in 
writing if:

 ■ the candidate is elected, or

 ■ the unsuccessful candidate’s total number of 
first preference votes is at least four per cent 
of the total number of formal first preference 
votes cast for all candidates in that division.

The deposit for a Senate candidate will be 
returned to the person who paid it or someone 
authorised by that person in writing if:

 ■ the candidate is elected, or

 ■ in the case of an ungrouped candidate, the 

unsuccessful candidate’s total number of first 
preference votes is at least four per cent of the 
total number of formal first preference votes 
cast for all candidates in that state or territory, 
or

 ■ where the unsuccessful candidate’s name 

is included in a group, the sum of the 
first preference votes received by all the 

Candidates Handbook 2016 

19


--- Page 20 ---

candidates in the group is at least four 
per cent of the total number of formal first 
preference votes in that state or territory.

The possibility of transmission or print delays 
on receiving fax machines must be considered 
under such circumstances.

All unsuccessful candidates not meeting these 
criteria forfeit their deposit.

Where to nominate

Single nominations for a division for the House of 
Representatives must be made at the office of 
the DRO for that division.

Bulk nominations of all the candidates 
endorsed by a registered party for the House of 
Representatives in a particular state or territory 
must be lodged with the AEO for that state or 
territory.

Nominations for the Senate for a state or territory 
must be made at the office of the AEO for that 
state or territory.

It is your responsibility as a candidate to ensure 
that your nomination is completed and received 
by the AEO or DRO (as appropriate), together 
with the full nomination deposit, by the close of 
nominations.

Lodgement with Australia Post is not the 
equivalent of receipt by the AEO or DRO. In 
addition, for the nomination to be valid it must 
include both the completed nomination form and 
the nomination deposit.

It is in your interest to lodge your nomination 
form as early as possible. Nominating on the last 
day may cause problems, particularly if there are 
deficiencies in your nomination that require time 
to resolve.

Faxed nominations

You can lodge your nomination form by fax, 
but it is your responsibility to ensure this fax 
is received by the relevant AEO or DRO (as 
appropriate) before the close of nominations. For 
the nomination to be valid both the completed 
nomination form and the nomination deposit 
must be received by the deadline.

By faxing the form, you acknowledge the time 
of receipt is when the form enters the AEC’s fax 
machine memory. The AEC is not responsible for 
any deadlines missed or losses incurred.

Note: emailed nomination forms will not be 
accepted.

For a nomination to be valid both the nomination 
form and the nomination deposit must be in the 
hands of the AEO or DRO, as appropriate, by 12 
noon on the day of the close of nominations.

Appointment of agent forms

If you intend to appoint an agent to act on 
your behalf with regards to election financial 
disclosure matters, you must lodge an 
Appointment of Candidate Agent form at the 
AEC’s National Office in Canberra before the 
close of nominations. The form and further 
information on appointing an agent, is available 
from either the AEC website or any AEC office.

Appointment forms and further information on 
appointing an agent are available in the Funding 
and Disclosure Guides for Candidates and 
Senate Groups on the AEC website.

Rejection of nomination

The Act, s.172

Electoral officers can reject a nomination if 
the provisions in the Act relating to any of the 
following have not been complied with:

 ■ the mode of nomination

 ■ the person to whom the nomination is made

 ■ the requisites for nomination

 ■ the form of consent to act.

A nomination will not be rejected simply because 
of a formal defect or error in the nomination if the 
officer to whom the nomination is addressed is 
satisfied there has been substantial compliance 
with the requirements of the Act.

Candidates Handbook 2016 

20


--- Page 21 ---

Withdrawal of nomination

The Act, s.180 and s.181

The Act, s.177

You may withdraw your consent to be nominated 
at any time up until the hour of nomination by 
lodging a withdrawal notice. A withdrawal notice 
can be obtained from any AEC office or by 
phoning the AEC on 13 23 26.

House of Representatives candidates must 
lodge their withdrawal notice with the DRO for 
the division for which they had nominated, even 
if their nomination was part of a bulk nomination. 
The registered officer may substitute a new 
candidate in a bulk nomination at any time before 
the close of nominations.

Senate candidates must lodge their withdrawal 
notice with the AEO for the state or territory for 
which they had nominated.

Once the withdrawal notice is in the hands of the 
relevant AEC officer the nomination is cancelled 
and arrangements are initiated to refund the 
deposit.

Uncontested elections

In a House of Representatives election, if 
only one candidate is nominated, the DRO 
will declare that candidate duly elected at the 
declaration of nominations.

In a Senate election, if the number of candidates 
nominated is not greater than the number of 
candidates to be elected, the AEO will declare 
the candidates duly elected at the declaration of 
nominations.

Death of a candidate

The Act, s.156(2)

For either the House of Representatives or the 
Senate, if a nominated candidate dies before the 
close of nominations, the nomination period is 
extended by one day. If the candidate was part 
of a bulk nomination, the registered officer may 
substitute a new candidate before the close of 
nominations.

In a House of Representatives election, if a 
candidate dies between the declaration of 
nominations and election day, the election in that 
division does not proceed. A new writ is issued 
for another election, but this supplementary 
election is held using the electoral roll prepared 
for the original election.

In a Senate election, if a candidate dies between 
the close of nominations and election day 
and the number of remaining candidates is 
not greater than the number of candidates to 
be elected, those candidates will be declared 
elected. If the number of candidates remaining 
is greater than the number of candidates to be 
elected, the election will proceed.

The Act, s.273(27)

A vote recorded on a Senate ballot paper for 
a deceased candidate will be counted to the 
candidate for whom the voter has recorded the 
next preference and the numbers indicating 
subsequent preferences are regarded as being 
altered accordingly.

Return of deposit on the 
death of a candidate

The Act, s.178

If a nominated candidate for either the House of 
Representatives or Senate dies before election 
day, the deposit lodged is returned to the person 
who paid it or a person authorised in writing by 
them. If the candidate paid the deposit it will be 
returned to their personal representative.

Declaration of nominations

The Act, s.176

Nominations are declared and the draws for 
positions on the ballot papers are held 24 hours 
after the close of nominations.

Candidates’ nomination forms will be produced 
at the conduct of the draw for positions. The 
media may inspect nominations but personal 
details of candidates (with the exception of 

Candidates Handbook 2016 

21


--- Page 22 ---

address details) indicated has being not for 
public release will be removed. Address details 
for a candidate who is a silent elector will not be 
released or declared. 

For a detailed list of dates and times for 
declaration of nominations and draw for ballot 
positions, contact your divisional office for the 
House of Representatives, state office for the 
Senate or visit the AEC website.

Provision of information on the 
certified lists of voters

The Act, s.90B

A candidate in a House of Representatives 
election is entitled to receive a copy of the 
certified list of voters for the division for which 
the candidate is seeking election. This copy is 
available from the AEC as soon as practicable 
after the close of the rolls and without charge.

Contact the relevant AEC House of 
Representatives divisional office to arrange for 
the collection of a copy of the certified list of 
voters.

Candidates Handbook 2016

Ballot papers

The Act

Part XVI, ‘The polling’

The final form of the ballot paper for the election 
in which you are a candidate will be of particular 
interest to you. While the laws relating to ballot 
papers are set out in detail in the Act, there is 
scope for candidates to request certain options 
in relation to their status as either an endorsed 
candidate or, if unendorsed, whether they want 
the word ‘Independent’ to appear on the ballot 
paper. If a candidate is endorsed, the party can 
choose to have the either the party name or 
party abbreviation appear on the ballot paper. 

This section explains the law as it relates to ballot 
papers and the procedures that determine how 
candidates, or groups of candidates, are listed 
on the ballot paper. It also sets out the time 
frame in which requests can be lodged, such as 
a request for a preference order of candidates on 
a Senate ballot paper.

Ballot paper format

Ballot papers show the name of a candidate 
as specified on the nomination form and, if 
applicable, the name or abbreviation of the 
registered political party that endorsed the 
candidate and the party’s registered logo.

If two or more candidates have similar names 
and this is considered likely to cause confusion, 
the AEC may add an additional description to 
distinguish them.

House of Representatives ballot papers are 
green. They have boxes with the names of every 
candidate and their party name or abbreviation 
or the word ‘Independent’ where applicable 
printed to the right of the boxes and where 
applicable, the party’s registered logo to the left 
of the box.

Voters must number every box by putting the 
number ‘1’ in the box next to the candidate who 
is their first choice, the number ‘2’ in the box 
next to their second choice, and so on until every 
box is consecutively numbered.

The ‘How to make your vote count’ fact sheet 
demonstrates how electors should complete 
both the House of Representatives and Senate 
ballot papers to ensure their vote counts. In a 
House of Representatives only election, voters 
who reside in states of Australia will receive a 
green ballot paper only. Voters in the Australian 
Capital Territory and the Northern Territory will 
receive both a House of Representatives ballot 
paper and a Senate ballot paper, which is white.

Candidates should carefully consider the 
information contained in this fact sheet when 
developing how-to-vote cards.

Senate ballot papers are white. They have two 
parts: an upper section (above the line) and a 
lower section (below the line), separated by a 
thick black line. 

A row of boxes above the line is the group voting 
square for parties and other Senate groups with 
more than one candidate. The party names or 
abbreviations of the name of registered parties 
appear above the line on the ballot paper and 
any registered party logos will be printed above 
the group voting square. The party names or 
abbreviations of the name of registered parties 
will also appear below each candidate’s name 
below the line. 

If an elector chooses to vote above the line, 
they are instructed to consecutively number at 
least 6 squares/boxes above the black line, in 
the order of their preference, commencing with 
the number ‘1’. By voting in this way, voters are 
preferencing the individual candidates within a 
group in the order in which they appear on the 
ballot paper.

The lower section contains boxes with the 
names of every candidate and their parties (if 
applicable) or the word ‘Independent’ (for some 
ungrouped candidates) printed to the right of 
the boxes. If an elector chooses to vote below 
the line, that is, in the lower section, they are 
instructed to consecutively number at least 12 
boxes/squares alongside individual candidates 
in order of their preference commencing with the 
number ‘1’. They may continue to express further 
preferences if they wish. 

Political party names and 
logos on ballot papers

Only a political party registered with the AEC 
can have its registered party name or registered 
party abbreviation and registered logo printed 
on the ballot papers next to the names of its 
candidates. Parties, however constituted, that 
are not registered with the AEC are not entitled 
to have a party name, abbreviation or logo 
printed next to their candidates’ names on the 
ballot paper.

The request to have a registered party name or 
abbreviation and logo printed on a ballot paper is 
made on the nomination form. No more than two 
logos will appear adjacent to their party or group 
name above the line on the Senate ballot paper.
Alternatively, the registered officer of that party 
may make the request in writing to the relevant 
AEO or DRO before the close of nominations.

Endorsed House of 
Representatives candidates

An endorsed candidate of a registered political 
party may have either the registered name or the 
registered abbreviation and registered logo of 
that political party printed next to their name on 
the ballot paper.

Only one candidate can be endorsed by a 
registered political party for any House of 
Representatives division. If a party attempts 
to endorse more than one candidate all 
nominations for that party in that division will fail.

Endorsed Senate candidates

A group of endorsed Senate candidates of a 
registered political party may have either the 
registered name or the registered abbreviation 
and the registered logo of that party printed next 
to their group voting square above the line on the 
ballot paper. They may also have the registered 
name or the registered abbreviation next to each 
of the candidates’ names below the line on the 
ballot paper.

A composite group of candidates endorsed by 
more than one registered political party may 
have a composite name printed next to their 
group voting square on the Senate ballot paper. 
Each single endorsed candidate will, however, 
have their own registered party name or 
registered abbreviation printed next to their name 
below the line on the ballot paper.

Independent candidates

If you are not endorsed by a registered political 
party you may request on the nomination form 
that the word ‘Independent’ be printed on the 
ballot paper next to your name.

If you do not make this request you will have 
nothing printed next to your name.

Grouped Senate candidates may not use the 
word ‘Independent’ next to their name or next to 
the group voting square.

Order of names on ballot 
papers

A system called ‘double randomisation’ – two 
random draws – is used for determining the 
order of groups and ungrouped candidates on 
Senate ballot papers and the order of candidates 
on House of Representatives ballot papers. 
All candidates and members of the public are 
welcome to attend these draws.

Candidates Handbook 2016 

25


--- Page 26 ---

The AEO determines the order of groups and 
ungrouped candidates on the ballot paper by 
conducting a public draw for positions. This 
draw is conducted in two parts, with each part 
consisting of two draws:

 ■ in the first part, the first draw allocates a 

number to each group and the second draw 
determines the order in which the groups 
appear on the ballot paper.

 ■ in the second part, the first draw allocates a 

number to each ungrouped candidate and the 
second draw determines the order in which 
ungrouped candidates appear on the ballot 
paper.

Ungrouped candidates do not have a box above 
the line on the Senate ballot paper.

House of Representatives  
ballot papers

The DRO declares the House of Representatives 
nominations received for their division at 12 
noon, 24 hours after the close of nominations. 
Following the declaration the DRO conducts two 
draws for ballot paper positions.

The first draw assigns a number to each 
candidate and the second draw determines the 
order in which candidates appear on the ballot 
paper.

Senate ballot papers

The AEO declares the nominations received for 
the Senate in their state or territory at 12 noon, 
24 hours after the nominations close. After the 
declaration, the AEO conducts the draws for 
positions on the ballot paper.

In Senate elections, the names of candidates 
included in groups are placed on the ballot paper 
to the left and ahead of the names of candidates 
not included in groups.

Voting

The Act

Part XV, ‘Postal voting’

Part XVI, ‘The polling’

For more information, see voting procedures

How-to-vote cards

Party workers may assist electors by handing 
them how-to-vote (HTV) cards and, if necessary, 
explain the cards to them. Party workers are 
reminded it is an offence to print, publish or 
distribute misleading or deceptive statements 
relating to the actual marking of a ballot paper. 
When producing HTV material, parties and 
candidates need to be mindful of the colour and 
size of their material so as to avoid any confusion 
between the HTV material and ballot papers 
issued to electors by the AEC. HTV cards must 
carry:

 ■ the name and full street address of the 

authorising representative.

 ■ the political party of the candidate. If the 

candidate is not endorsed by a registered 
political party, the name of the candidate and 
the word ‘candidate’ needs to be included.

A person must not publish a HTV card during an 
election period unless the name of the registered 
political party or candidate on whose behalf the 
card has been published is clearly printed at 
either the bottom or top of each printed face of 
the card.

A HTV card is defined in subsection 4(1) of 
the Act. In short, it is any printed medium that 
lists the name of two or more candidates and 
directs or encourages electors to mark their 
preference for the candidates in a particular 
order. It does not include a card that only relates 
to first preference votes or only relates to last 
preference votes.

Part XVA, ‘Pre-poll voting’

Part XXI, ‘Electoral offences’

Schedule 2, ‘Grounds of application for postal 
or pre-poll vote’

Following recent legislative amendments referred 
to at the beginning of this handbook, there 
has been some discussion in the media about 
whether parties, Senate Groups and candidates 
can advise voters to ‘simply vote one above the 
line’ on the Senate ballot paper. The legislation 
is clear – s.239 of the Act should be read as 
instructions to voters on how to cast a formal 
vote.

Any HTV card or other electoral advertising 
that does not reflect the requirements of s.239 
(for the Senate) or s.240 (for the House of 
Representatives) runs the risk of being found by 
a court to be in breach of s.329 of the Act.

There is a general prohibition on canvassing 
within six metres of an entrance to a polling 
place, which means that HTV cards or other 
non-AEC notices cannot be distributed or 
displayed within that distance. HTV cards must 
not be exhibited or left in a polling place.

Appendix 1 lists the offences under the Act.

HTV cards produced for electors by political 
parties and candidates need to have clear 
instructions and be well designed so they assist 
electors to cast a formal vote. Otherwise, HTV 
information may confuse some voters and cause 
them to cast an informal vote without meaning to 
do so.

HTV cards for electors serviced by mobile polling 
teams may be supplied by party workers to the 
team leader of a mobile polling team. It is not the 
responsibility of the team leader to arrange for 
this or to remind party workers to do so. Mobile 
polling teams will provide the electoral material to 
electors on request.

Candidates Handbook 2016

Electoral advertising

The Electoral Backgrounder on Electoral 
Advertising provides a basic introduction to 
electoral advertising. Its contents are a guide 
only. Individual matters are assessed on a case-
by-case basis and ultimately it is for the courts to 
decide upon the interpretation of the law in any 
particular case. Accordingly, if you are in doubt 
about the interpretation of the law in particular 
circumstances, you should seek your own 
independent legal advice.

The Electoral Backgrounder on Electoral 
Advertising discusses:

 ■ intent of the law

 ■ authorisation of electoral advertising

 ■ headings to electoral advertisements

 ■ electoral advertising on the Internet

 ■ misleading and deceptive electoral 

advertisements

 ■ second preference how-to-vote cards

 ■ truth in political advertising

 ■ defamation of candidates

 ■ electronic media blackout

 ■ political advertising bans

 ■ non-compliance, such as electoral advertising 

offences

 ■ complaints.

Candidates are encouraged to pay particular 
attention to the authorisation of electoral 
advertising.

Election funding and financial disclosure

The Act

Part XX, ‘Election funding and financial disclosure’

Some candidates will be eligible to receive 
payment of election funding following a federal 
election but all candidates are required to 
lodge a compulsory financial disclosure return. 
Candidates can appoint an agent to receive their 
election funding (if eligible) and complete the 
financial disclosure return on their behalf.

This section gives a brief overview of candidate 
agents and Senate group agents, financial 
disclosure obligations and payment of election 
funding.

Further detailed information on election funding 
and candidate financial disclosure can be 
obtained from the AEC website.

Agents

Appointing an agent

Agent appointment forms are available on the 
appointment of agents page or by contacting  
the AEC.

A party agent is not automatically appointed 
as a candidate or Senate group agent unless 
individually appointed by each endorsed 
candidate of that party.

It is your responsibility to ensure that your agent 
appointment form is received by the AEC’s 
National Office in Canberra before the close of 
nominations. Completed forms can be faxed to 
02 6293 7655, scanned and emailed to  
fad@aec.gov.au, or sent by post. Postal address 
details are available on the forms.

Agent appointment forms should only be sent to 
the AEC’s National Office, not sent to any other 
office.

An agent cannot be appointed if their 
appointment form is received by the AEC’s 
National Office after the close of nominations. 

In this case, individual candidates will be 
responsible for completing their own financial 
disclosure return.

The appointment is valid for a single election 
only.

Candidate agents

Each candidate may appoint an agent whether 
or not they are endorsed by a party. Candidates 
who do not appoint an agent are deemed to be 
their own agent.

Senate group agent

Senate groups, the members of which have 
been endorsed by a single party, are not 
required to appoint an agent for the group 
or lodge a disclosure return. All receipts and 
expenditure of a Senate group should be 
included in the annual return of that party, 
however, individual members of such a group 
may appoint an agent.

An agent is not the agent of the individual 
members of the group unless separately 
appointed as such.

If no agent is appointed for a Senate group, or 
the agent appointment form is received by the 
AEC’s National Office in Canberra after the close 
of nominations, the first candidate listed in the 
Senate group is deemed to be the agent.

Senate groups endorsed by more than one 
party may appoint an agent for the group. If no 
appointment is made the person whose name 
appears first on the ballot paper is deemed to be 
the agent.

Unendorsed Senate groups can appoint an 
agent for the group. If no appointment is made 
the person whose name appears first on the 
ballot paper is deemed to be the agent for the 
group.

Candidates Handbook 2016 

29


--- Page 30 ---

Eligibility of an agent

To be eligible for appointment as an agent, the 
nominated person must:

 ■ be at least 18 years of age,

 ■ not have been convicted of an offence under 
the funding and disclosure provisions of the 
Act,

 ■ have signed a consent to the appointment, 

and

 ■ have signed a declaration of eligibility for 

appointment.

A person may be appointed as the agent for 
multiple candidates, including a Senate group, 
but a separate form must be completed for each 
appointment.

Election funding

Candidates who receive four per cent or more of 
the formal first preference votes in an election are 
entitled to receive election funding. For Senate 
groups, the group as a whole must receive at 
least four per cent of the formal first preference 
votes in their state or territory in order to be 
eligible for election funding.

The amount to be paid is calculated by 
multiplying the number of formal first preference 
votes received by the funding rate. The funding 
rate applicable to this election is available on the 
AEC website.

At least 95 per cent of election funding is paid 
in the fourth week after election day on the 
basis of votes counted as at the 20th day after 
election day. The balance is paid when the 
count is finalised and verified, and when the full 
entitlement is known.

In the case of independent candidates or Senate 
groups, payment is made to the agent of the 
candidate or group. If no agent is appointed, 
payment is made to the candidate or the 
member of the Senate group placed first in the 
group.

In the case of endorsed candidates and Senate 
groups, funding is paid to the party agent of the 
endorsing party or parties.

Detailed information about the payment 
arrangements for parties endorsing candidates 
or Senate groups can be obtained from the AEC 
website.

Financial disclosure returns

Following an election, candidate and Senate 
group agents must lodge financial disclosure 
returns with the AEC. Further information, 
including comprehensive funding and disclosure 
guides, is available on the AEC website.

If a candidate or Senate group does not appoint 
an agent or the appointment form is received by 
the AEC’s National Office in Canberra after the 
close of nominations:

 ■ the candidate is deemed to be their own 

agent.

 ■ the first person listed in the Senate group is 

deemed to be the group agent.

Failure to lodge a disclosure return is an offence 
which may be referred to the Commonwealth 
Director of Public Prosecutions.

Election donations

Election donations may be in cash (money, 
direct deposit or cheque), or ‘in-kind’ such 
as professional services or office equipment 
provided free of charge or at less than normal 
commercial value. Donations may be received 
directly by the candidate or by someone acting 
on behalf, or with the authority, of the candidate 
or Senate group.

In-kind donations must be disclosed at the 
normal commercial or sale value of the item or 
service.

People or organisations making donations to a 
candidate in excess of the applicable disclosure 
threshold are also required to lodge a financial 
disclosure return with the AEC.

If a person or organisation makes a donation 
to the campaign committee of an endorsed 
candidate, this is treated as though the donation 
is made to the relevant political party and is 
therefore required to be reported in the party’s 
annual disclosure returns rather than the 
candidate’s election return.

Candidates Handbook 2016

--- Page 31 ---

Electoral expenditure

All electoral or campaign expenditure incurred 
in each of the following categories must be 
reported:

 ■ broadcasting advertisements (including 

production costs)

 ■ publishing advertisements (including 

production costs)

 ■ displaying advertisements at a theatre or other 
place of entertainment (including production 
costs)

 ■ costs of campaign material that was used 

or distributed where the name and address 
of the author, or the authorising person, 
is required (such as how-to-vote cards, 
pamphlets or posters)

 ■ direct mailing

the expenditure of all members of the group 
is consolidated and reported as part of the 
group financial disclosure, or by the party if all 
members of the group are endorsed by the 
same party.

Senate groups

All Senate groups must lodge a disclosure return 
with the exception of Senate groups whose 
members are all endorsed by the same party. 
These groups report through their political party. 
Disclosure returns must be lodged even when no 
donations were received or expenditure incurred. 
In this case ‘nil’ returns must be lodged.

The financial disclosure returns of Senate groups 
must include:

	the number of donors and total amount of all 

 ■ opinion polling and other research relating to 

donations received

the election.

Certain other campaign expenditure (for 
example, hire of premises or equipment, freight, 
telephone and travel costs) does not have to be 
reported.

Candidates

All candidates, including the individual members 
of a Senate group, have a financial disclosure 
obligation after the election.

All candidates must lodge a financial disclosure 
return even when no donations were received 
or expenditure incurred. In this case ‘nil’ returns 
must be lodged.

The financial disclosure returns of candidates 
must include the following:

 ■ the number of donors and total amount of all 

donations received

 ■ the names and details of people and 

organisations who made donations in excess 
of the disclosure threshold (this information is 
available on the AEC website)

 ■ all amounts spent on certain types of electoral 

expenditure.

The only exception is for electoral expenditure 
incurred by candidates who stand as part 
of a Senate group. These candidates do not 
separately disclose electoral expenditure as 

	names and details of people and 

organisations who made donations in excess 
of the applicable disclosure threshold

	all amounts spent on certain types of electoral 

expenditure.

Where and when to lodge 
returns

Returns can be prepared and lodged online 
via the eReturns portal. The eReturns portal 
can be accessed from https://ereturns.aec.
gov.au or via the AEC website. The easiest 
way to lodge a return accurately and on time is 
to use the eReturns portal. It is quick, secure, 
environmentally friendly and allows importing 
of files which eliminates transcription errors. 
To assist with completing a return online, a 
step-by-step guide is available on the AEC 
website.

If a candidate or agent is unable to lodge a return 
online via the eReturns portal the relevant forms 
may be downloaded from the AEC website. 
Alternatively, contact the Funding and Disclosure 
team by email at fad@aec.gov.au or phone on 02 
6271 4552 and forms can be emailed, faxed or 
posted to the agent or candidate.

Retention of records

All relevant records, whether formal or informal, 
that support disclosures made in returns must 
be kept for a minimum of three years. Receipt 
books, bank records, receipt registers, source 
documents and working papers must be kept for 
this period.

Offences

Section 315 of the Act contains penalty 
provisions for offences against the funding and 
disclosure provisions. These include

 ■ failure to lodge a disclosure return

 ■ late lodgement

 ■ incomplete and inaccurate returns

 ■ failure to retain supporting records for three 

years.

Public inspection

Election financial disclosure returns are available 
for public inspection 24 weeks after election day 
on the AEC website.

The Candidates Handbook, Scrutineers 
Handbook, Funding and Disclosure Guides 
for Candidates and Senate groups, and other 
electoral information are also available on the 
AEC website.

Financial disclosure returns, including ‘nil’ 
returns, must be lodged with the AEC’s National 
Office in Canberra within 15 weeks after election 
day. The AEC has no discretion to extend this 
deadline.

Disclosure period

The period covered by a return varies for election 
donations and electoral expenditure, for new 
and previous candidates, and for candidates 
and Senate groups. Details are on the financial 
disclosure return form.

Administration

Candidate record keeping
Candidates and Senate groups must give 
consideration to financial recording systems and 
procedures that are appropriate to their needs 
and circumstances and will enable the Candidate 
or Senate Group Return to be completed 
accurately.

All transactions should be individually recorded, 
supported by source documents and, where 
possible, reconciled to bank statements.

Examples of source documents are:

 ■ receipts

 ■ tax invoices

 ■ loan documents

 ■ wages records

 ■ bank deposit books and cheque butts

 ■ bank account statements

 ■ credit card statements.

Source documents should contain sufficient 
information required to complete the return, such 
as the:

 ■ date of the transaction

 ■ name of person and/or organisation from 

whom a gift/donation was received

 ■ name of person and/or organisation to whom 
a payment was made and what the payment 
was for

 ■ name and address of an organisation that has 

provided a loan to the candidate

 ■ total payment made or amount received

Scrutineers

The Act

Part XVI, ‘The polling’

Part XVIII, ‘The scrutiny’

As a candidate you have a range of clearly 
defined rights and responsibilities, but you are 
not permitted to participate in the administrative 
conduct of an election.

Because of this exclusion you have the right to 
appoint scrutineers to represent you at polling 
places and during the various stages of counting 
of ballot papers (the scrutiny).

The Scrutineers Handbook sets out how the 
law provides for the appointment of scrutineers, 
as well as the rights and responsibilities of 
scrutineers.

What is the role of 
scrutineers?

On behalf of candidates, scrutineers have the 
right to be present in order to check any possible 
irregularities when the ballot boxes are sealed, 
when they are opened, and when the votes are 
sorted and counted.

Scrutineers may observe:

 ■ the polling in a polling place

 ■ the scrutiny in a counting centre

 ■ the preliminary scrutiny of declaration 

envelopes

 ■ the further scrutiny of declaration votes

 ■ the fresh scrutiny of all votes.

Appointment of scrutineers  
by candidates

At early voting and during polling

The Act s.200DA and s.217

You may appoint scrutineers to represent you at 
every polling place.

However, no more than one scrutineer per 
candidate is allowed for mobile polling or in an 
early voting centre at the one time and no more 
than one scrutineer per candidate is allowed for 
each issuing point at a polling place on election 
day.

You appoint scrutineers by completing a 
scrutineer appointment form for each scrutineer. 
This can be obtained from the AEC website or 
any AEC divisional office.

You must give the name and residential address 
of the scrutineer and sign the form. A facsimile of 
your signature is acceptable.

You may fax the form to the DRO or the Officer 
in Charge of a polling place, if such facilities are 
available.

At the preliminary scrutiny of 
declaration votes

The DRO conducts the preliminary scrutiny 
of declaration vote envelopes. This process 
determines which declaration votes are 
admissible and can proceed to further scrutiny. 
The number of scrutineers permitted per 
candidate for the preliminary scrutiny is limited to 
the number of officers engaged in the scrutiny.

The preliminary scrutiny of early declaration vote 
envelopes can begin on the Monday before 
election day. This helps the DRO begin the 
further scrutiny of these types of declaration 
votes promptly after election day.

Candidates Handbook 2016 

33


--- Page 34 ---

At the further scrutiny of  
declaration votes

The DRO conducts the further scrutiny of HoR 
and referendum ballot papers and a DRO Senate 
count of all Senate ballot papers. At the further 
scrutiny/DRO Senate count, declaration vote 
envelopes which have passed the preliminary 
scrutiny are opened, and the ballot papers 
extracted and counted.

The DRO will contact you before the further 
scrutiny/DRO Senate count to advise you of its 
times, dates and locations.

Scrutineers have the same rights and 
responsibilities at a further scrutiny as they have 
at the scrutiny of ballot papers in a counting 
centre.

The actual scrutiny of Senate ballot papers is 
done by the AEO at the Central Senate Scrutiny 
(CSS) centre in the weeks following election 
night. Scrutineers have the same rights and 
responsibilities at the CSS scrutiny as they have 
at a HoR scrutiny undertaken by a DRO.

Scrutineers Handbook

More detailed information concerning the rights, 
duties, powers and functions of scrutineers 
during polling and scrutiny is contained in the 
Scrutineers Handbook.

The Scrutineers Handbook also explains the 
different methods of voting, matters relating 
to the formality and informality of House of 
Representatives and Senate ballot papers, and 
the conduct of House of Representatives and 
Senate scrutinies.

Early declaration vote envelopes are checked to 
ensure they have been signed by the voter and 
that the voter is correctly enrolled.

Any envelopes requiring further investigation will 
be put aside until after the close of polling.

The DRO will contact you before the preliminary 
scrutiny to advise you of its times, dates and 
locations.

The Scrutineers Handbook is available on the 
AEC website, from all AEC offices or by phoning 
13 23 26.

No declaration vote envelope can be opened  
or ballot papers scrutinised before the close of 
the poll.

At the scrutiny

The Act, s.264

You may also appoint scrutineers to represent 
you at the checking and counting of the ballot 
papers after the close of polling. The number 
of scrutineers who may represent you at each 
counting centre is limited to the number of 
officers engaged in the counting of ballot papers.

The appointment of a scrutineer must be 
made in writing and given or sent to the officer 
conducting the scrutiny at the counting centre. 
You must sign the appointment form (a facsimile 
of your signature is acceptable), which must give 
the name and address of the scrutineer. Once 
again, a fax is acceptable if these facilities are 
available.

You may use the same form to appoint 
scrutineers for both the polling and the scrutiny.

You may scrutineer on behalf of another 
candidate at a scrutiny as long as the ballot 
papers being scrutinised are not related to 
the election in which you are a candidate. For 
example, a House of Representatives candidate 
in Division A may be a scrutineer in Division 
B. You should check with the DRO or AEO (as 
appropriate) before making or accepting such an 
appointment to scrutineer.

Counting the votes

The Act

Part XVIII, ‘The scrutiny’

An understanding of the AEC’s counting 
procedures will help you, as a candidate, know 
what to expect as the results of the election 
unfold. This chapter details how the scrutiny 
or count is approached for the House of 
Representatives and Senate.

On election night

The counting of ordinary votes begins in each 
polling place immediately after the poll closes at 
6pm on election day. Ordinary votes at a polling 
place are votes cast by electors within their 
division on election day. 

House of Representatives count on 
election night

Ballot papers are initially sorted by the polling 
officials into first preference votes for each 
candidate and informal ballot papers. The results 
are then tabulated and the first preference vote 
figures for each candidate are telephoned to the 
relevant DRO.

Divisional staff then enter these figures for each 
polling place in their division into the national 
computerised Election Management System 
which, in turn, updates the Tally Room (TR). The 
TR can be accessed on the AEC website.

In relation to pre-poll votes cast as ordinary votes 
in the lead up to polling day; 

Indicative two-candidate-preferred 
(TCP)

 ■ HoR votes will be counted on election night

 ■ Senate votes will be counted commencing on 

the Monday after election day.

Tally Room

The AEC hosts a website election results system 
known as the Tally Room (TR), which provides 
election information and results in a user-friendly 
format.

The TR allows people visiting the website on 
election night and the weeks following to access 
progressive House of Representatives results 
and figures from the Senate count for all states 
and territories, together with a comprehensive 
range of summary and analysis screens. The 
TR produces approximately 1 200 individual 
pages of results on election night and more than 
20 000 pages in the post-election period. These 
results are updated regularly on election night 
and in the post-election period.

On the completion of the count of first 
preferences for the House of Representatives 
at each polling place, the ARO (or Officer in 
Charge) must, as directed by the relevant AEO (in 
accordance with s.274(2A) of the Act), conduct 
an indicative distribution of preferences on a 
two-candidate-preferred (TCP) basis.

The TCP count shows where preferences 
have been distributed to the probable final 
two candidates in an election. It must be 
remembered that this count is only an indicative 
result of the election in a division. It is possible 
that early, absent and mobile votes, counted 
after election day, could alter the outcome.

The ballot papers for the two nominated 
candidates are set aside and the ballot papers 
for the remaining candidates are distributed to 
one of the two nominated candidates according 
to who is more preferred or gets the ‘best 
preference’.

For example, if the two nominated candidates 
are Labor and Liberal then a ballot paper which 
has ‘1’ Democrats, ‘2’ Independent, ‘3’ Labor 
and then ‘4’ Liberal will be added to the first 

Candidates Handbook 2016 

35


--- Page 36 ---

preference figures for the Labor candidate. 
Conversely, a ballot paper that showed ‘1’ 
Independent ‘2’ Liberal (etc.) would be added 
to the first preference figures for the Liberal 
candidate.

Like the count of first preference votes, this result 
is telephoned through to the DRO, who enters it 
into the Election Management System. This will 
update the TR, which is available on the AEC 
website.

Senate count on election night

On election night, the ARO counts first 
preference votes on the Senate ballot papers 
– above the line, below the line and the total 
number which are obviously informal. A single 
figure for each group and each ungrouped 
candidate is reported.

Senate results cannot be calculated until the 
state or territory-wide total of all votes is known 
and is used to determine the quota – the 
proportion of votes required by a candidate to 
be elected. It is only possible, therefore, to get 
a general impression of the Senate results on 
election night.

The Senate count on election night begins at the 
same time as the TCP count for the House of 
Representatives. Results from the Senate count 
are telephoned through to the DRO, and group 
totals and ungrouped results are entered into the 
Election Management System in the same way 
as House of Representatives votes.

Referendum count on election night

The counting of referendum ballot papers also 
begins on election night. The ‘Yes’ and ‘No’ 
votes are counted, telephoned through to the 
DRO and entered into the Election Management 
System.

After election night

Fresh scrutiny or recheck

The initial scrutiny conducted at the polling place 
on election night is routinely followed by a ‘fresh 
scrutiny’ (HoR and referendum) and DRO Senate 
count conducted at a divisional out-posted 
centre in the days following election day. The 
exact time will be advised by the DRO.

At this stage, some HoR ballot papers earlier 
treated as informal may be admitted to the 
scrutiny by the DRO, and some ballot papers 
originally treated as formal may be reclassified as 
informal.

A full distribution of preferences is conducted in 
every House of Representatives division, even 
where a candidate already has an absolute 
majority of first preference votes. The result of 
this full distribution of preferences is used to 
calculate the two-candidate-preferred statistics.

Scrutineers who have been appointed by a 
candidate for the division may be present 
during the fresh scrutiny or count. The number 
of scrutineers present is limited to one per 
candidate for each AEC staff member involved in 
the count.

Senate scrutiny

After the DRO Senate count, the AEO conducts 
the scrutiny and assesses the formality of Senate 
ballot papers at the CSS for the state/territory. 
The Senate scrutiny and the distribution of 
preferences are conducted using a computer 
application. The computerised system calculates 
the quota, distributes preferences and 
determines the result of the Senate election.

This system provides full accountability and an 
audit trail, including reports for inspection by 
scrutineers.

The relevant AEO notifies all Senate candidates 
by letter of the location and hours of operation of 
the CSS centre in that state or territory.

Candidates Handbook 2016 

36

Declaration votes

Postal Votes

Declaration votes do not get counted on election 
night; instead, they are counted in the weeks 
following election night. The counting of these 
votes takes longer than the counting of ordinary 
votes.

In the days following election day, a ‘declaration 
vote exchange’ is carried out between the 
divisions within each state and territory, where 
declaration votes are physically passed on to the 
relevant division. Declaration votes received on 
behalf of divisions in another state or territory or 
overseas are sent via state or territory offices for 
distribution to the relevant divisions. Once the 
declaration votes are received and processed in 
the home division, the counting of these votes 
can begin.

For federal elections and by-elections, the 
legislation requires that postal vote envelopes 
containing the ballot papers need to be received 
by the appropriate DRO on or before 13 days 
after election day. These votes are included in 
the count if:

 ■ the vote has been cast before 6pm on election 

day

 ■ the vote is received by the DRO within 13 days 

of election day.

For this reason, the counting of postal votes is 
an ongoing process for 13 or more days after 
election day.

Recounts and disputed returns

The Act

Part XVIII, ‘The scrutiny’

Part XXII, ‘Court of Disputed Returns’

You, as a candidate, can benefit from a good 
understanding of the circumstances and 
procedures leading to a recount of votes in an 
election, as well as the circumstances under 
which the High Court would sit as a Court of 
Disputed Returns.

As a candidate you can request a recount 
of ballot papers in an election, however, the 
electoral official is not automatically obliged to 
accept your request. The official also has the 
power to direct a recount at their discretion 
without waiting for a request.

Recounts

The Act, ss.278 and 279

A recount may be undertaken, approved or 
directed at any time before the result of an 
election is declared. It should not be confused 
with the routine re-check (fresh scrutiny) of the 
House of Representatives votes counted on 
election night.

In the absence of specifically alleged errors 
it is unlikely that a recount would be required 
at either a House of Representatives election 
or Senate election. However, in the case of a 
House of Representatives division, if the margin 
of votes at the completion of the distribution 
of preferences is less than 100, a recount is 
conducted as a matter of course.

Given the checks and balances in scrutiny 
systems, significant sorting errors are highly 
unlikely to go undetected.

House of  
Representatives recount

If requesting a recount, House of 
Representatives candidates must write to the 
relevant DRO giving their reasons for the request.

DROs may initiate a recount, or be directed 
by the Electoral Commissioner at any time 
before the declaration of a result of a House of 
Representatives election to recount all or some 
of the ballot papers.

The DRO must notify each candidate of the time 
and place of any recount.

The DRO conducting a recount has the same 
powers as if the recount was the original scrutiny. 
A DRO may reverse any decision in the scrutiny 
to admit or reject a ballot paper.

During a recount the DRO may, and at the 
request of a scrutineer must, reserve any ballot 
paper for the decision of the AEO. The AEO 
must decide whether any ballot paper reserved 
for their decision is to be admitted or rejected. If 
a ballot paper is considered as being admitted 
by the AEO, the DRO will determine to whom the 
first preference has been allocated.

If an election result is challenged, the High Court 
of Australia, sitting as the Court of Disputed 
Returns, may consider any ballot paper reserved 
for the decision of the AEO, but may only order 
a further recount if it is satisfied that a recount is 
justified.

Candidates Handbook 2016

Evaluating a request for a House of 
Representatives recount

Evaluating a request for  
a Senate Recount

The general guidelines observed in evaluating 
requests for a recount are as follows:

 ■ A recount may take place where there are 

valid and specific grounds for supposing that 
it could change the result of the election in the 
division or where there are specific grounds 
for determining the need for a recount of 
specific ballot papers (such as in response to 
specific allegations or incidents).

The guidelines for evaluating a request for 
a Senate Recount are detailed in the AEC’s 
Recount Policy for Senate Elections.

For more information on formality, see Ballot 
paper formality guidelines on the AEC website.

Court of Disputed Returns

 ■ A request for a recount which does not 

The Act, Part XXII

plead any valid and specific grounds must 
be refused. A request for a recount needs to 
identify specific ballot papers and associated 
significant counting process errors or 
irregularities that could change the result of an 
election within a division.

 ■ Wherever possible, the grounds pleaded by 
the candidate requesting the recount will be 
used to narrow down to as small a category 
as possible the ballot papers that need to be 
re-examined.

 ■ Where the margin of votes at the completion 
of the distribution of preferences for a House 
of Representative division is less than 100, 
a recount will be undertaken as a matter of 
course.

 ■ Only one recount of any set of ballot papers 

will occur.

 ■ Requests for recounts will only be considered, 

and actioned, in the period after the 
completion of all scrutinies and before the 
declaration of the poll in the division.

Senate recount

If requesting a recount, Senate candidates must 
write to the AEO for the state or territory giving 
their reasons for the request.

If the AEO for the state or territory refuses a 
request from a candidate to direct a recount of 
any Senate ballot papers, the candidate may 
appeal in writing to the Electoral Commissioner. 
The Electoral Commissioner is empowered to 
either direct or refuse a recount.

Anyone contemplating a challenge to an election 
result should consult their own legal advisers. 
The validity of the election of any member of 
parliament may only be disputed by a petition 
to the Court of Disputed Returns within 40 
days of the return of the writ. The Common 
Informers (Parliamentary Disqualifications) Act 
1975 provides penalties for ineligible members 
of parliament who sit as members or senators. 
Such an action has to be argued in the High 
Court under section 5 of that Act.

The Act, s.360(1)

The Court of Disputed Returns sits as an open 
court. Its powers include the following:

i. 

ii. 

iii. 

to adjourn

to compel the attendance of witnesses and 
the production of documents

to grant to any party to a petition leave to 
inspect in the presence of a prescribed 
officer the rolls and other documents (except 
ballot papers) used at or in connection with 
any election and to take, in the presence of 
the prescribed officer, extracts from those 
rolls and documents

iv.  to examine witnesses on oath

v. 

to declare that any person who was returned 
as elected was not duly elected

vi.  to declare any candidate duly elected who 

was not returned as elected

vii.  to declare any election absolutely void

viii.  to dismiss or uphold the petition in whole or 

part

ix.  to award costs

x. 

to punish any contempt of its authority by 
fine or imprisonment.

Candidates Handbook 2016 

39


--- Page 40 ---

A petitioner cannot challenge, in the Court 
of Disputed Returns, the validity of a general 
election as a whole. The petitioner may only 
challenge the election in the division of the 
House of Representatives or, for the Senate, 
the State or Territory, for which he or she was 
enrolled on the date on which the election was 
held.

What must a petition contain?

Petitions must set out the facts relied on to 
invalidate the election and, if they allege illegal 
practices, must show how these could have 
affected the election result.

The Act, s.355

A petition must:

1.  set out the facts relied on to invalidate the 

election,

2.  set out those facts with sufficient particularity 
to identify the specific matter or matters on 
which the petitioner relies as justifying the 
grant of relief the Court may at any time after 
the filing of the petition relieve the petitioner 
from complying with this,

3.  contain a prayer asking for the relief the 

petitioner claims to be entitled to,

4.  be signed by a candidate at the election in 

dispute or by a person who was qualified to 
vote at the election,

5.  be attested by two witnesses whose 

occupations and addresses are stated,

6.  be filed in the Registry of the High Court 

within 40 days after:

a. 

the return of the writ,

b. 

c. 

d. 

if the election day for the election in 
dispute is also the election day

for another election or other elections–
the return of the writs for the election in 
dispute and that other election or those 
other elections is returned last, or

if the choice of a person to hold the 
place of a Senator under section 15 
of the Constitution is in dispute – the 
notification of that choice.

The Act, s.356

When filing a petition, the petitioner must deposit 
security for costs.

Note: there may be other filing fees and charges 
under High Court rules.

The AEC is not able to assist petitioners in 
preparing petitions. This is because there would 
be a conflict of interest, as the AEC is often a 
respondent to any petition before the Court of 
Disputed Returns.

Voiding an election for illegal 
practices

The Act, s.362

An election may be declared void if the court 
finds illegal practices, within the meaning of that 
term under the Act, took place.

Section 362 of the Act, which details when an 
election is declared void due to illegal practices, 
is reproduced below.

1. 

If the Court of Disputed Returns finds that 
a successful candidate has committed or 
has attempted to commit bribery or undue 
influence, the election of the candidate shall 
be declared void.

2.  No finding by the Court of Disputed Returns 
shall bar or prejudice any prosecution for any 
illegal practice.

3.  The Court of Disputed Returns shall not 

declare that any person returned as elected 
was not duly elected, or declare any election 
void:

a.  on the ground of any illegal practice 

committed by any person other than the 
candidate and without the knowledge or 
authority of the candidate, or

b.  on the ground of any illegal practice 

other than bribery or corruption or 
attempted bribery or corruption,

c.  unless the Court is satisfied that the 
result of the election was likely to be 
affected, and that it is just that the 
candidate should be declared not to be 
duly elected or that the election should 
be declared void.

Candidates Handbook 2016 

40


--- Page 41 ---

4.  The Court of Disputed Returns must not 

declare that any person returned as elected 
was not duly elected, or declare any election 
void, on the ground that someone has 
contravened the Broadcasting Services Act 
1992 or the Radio Communications Act 
1992.

The Act, s.386

Any candidate found guilty of bribery or undue 
influence or interference with political liberty may 
not be elected to or sit as a member of either 
House of Parliament for two years from the date 
of conviction or finding by the Court.

Election advertising offences

The Act, s.328, s.328A, s.329 and s.331

The Commonwealth Parliament has determined 
that the Act should not regulate the content 
of political messages contained in electoral 
advertising. The intent of the Act is:

	to ensure electors are informed about the 

source of political advertising, and

	to ensure that political advertising does not 

mislead or deceive electors about the way in 
which a vote must be cast.

The AEC therefore has no role or responsibility in 
deciding whether political messages published 
or broadcast in relation to a federal election 
are true or untrue. The AEC does have a role 
however, in doing its best to ensure that electoral 
advertisements are properly authorised, so that 
electors can know who is responsible for the 
statements contained in them.

Complaints must be made in writing, addressed 
to the Deputy Electoral Commissioner, and be 
accompanied by evidence of the material in 
question. This could be an original copy of a 
how-to-vote card, an electoral advertisement 
or other documents relevant to the allegation. 
Depending on the nature of the document 
in question, a scanned copy or an emailed 
photograph may be acceptable.

This provides the context for preliminary 
assessment of the matter and also enables 
relevant evidence to be tendered in court if 
proceedings are undertaken at a later date. 
The complainant should also provide as much 
additional information as possible to enable 
assessment of the alleged breach. The AEC 
will immediately acknowledge receipt of the 
complaint.

If an original copy cannot be obtained, a copy 
of the entire document may be forwarded 
to the AEC. Similarly, for a complaint about 
electoral advertisements on the Internet, the 
complaint should, if possible, be accompanied 
by a print copy of the webpage, showing the 
advertisement, from which the AEC can make 
a formal assessment of its compliance with the 
law.

In the absence of a printed copy of the 
advertisement as it appeared on the Internet 
being provided with the complaint, the AEC will 
require enough information about the Internet 
site in order to locate the advertisement and 
make an assessment regarding compliance with 
the Act.

For more detailed information on the regulation 
of electoral advertisements, you should refer 
to the Electoral Backgrounder on Electoral 
Advertising, which is available on the AEC 
website or from AEC national and state offices.

Photographers and media

Photographers and members of the media or 
their equipment must not hinder, inconvenience 
or delay any polling staff or voters. No 
photographs may be taken of a person recording 
a vote that would in any way identify how the 
person has voted.

Anyone arranging for photographers or media 
to visit polling places should contact the DRO 
in sufficient time to enable arrangements to be 
made with the officer-in-charge at the relevant 
polling place.

Members of the media or photographers must 
have the permission of the DRO before visiting a 
polling place, and they must have the permission 
of the relevant DRO and the institution 
concerned before visiting any place where 
mobile polling is being conducted.

For information, including the guidelines on 
media coverage in polling places, is available on 
the AEC website or from AEC national and state 
offices.

the Scrutineers Handbook is given to each 
candidate when they nominate at a divisional 
office.

General information on a range of topics is 
available by visiting the AEC website, from all 
AEC offices or by phoning 13 23 26.

Candidate information 
sessions

To assist political parties and individuals who 
are interested in nominating as candidates for 
the federal election, information sessions are 
conducted in each state and territory. These 
sessions provide an overview of the electoral 
process, including information on the nomination 
process and the rights and responsibilities of 
candidates.

To find out more about the candidate information 
sessions, see the AEC website or contact the 
AEC on 13 23 26.

Official material available  
to candidates

House of Representatives candidates are entitled 
to receive a copy of the certified list of voters for 
the division for which they are seeking election, 
as soon as they are produced after the close of 
the rolls for the election.

Senate candidates are not entitled to copies of 
the certified list. Note: the certified list of voters is 
an official AEC publication and must be handled 
and disposed of in accordance with the Act. 
You must dispose of the document as per the 
undertaking you made on its receipt.

For representation in the House of Representatives, Australia is divided into 
electoral divisions. The number of these divisions is determined by population. To 
ensure equal representation, the boundaries of these divisions have to be redrawn 
or redistributed periodically. (For representation in the Senate, each state and 
territory is one electorate. All states are multi-member electorates and have the 
same number of Senators. Territory representation is determined by the federal 
parliament).

The AEC officer responsible for conducting the election in each division. The DROs 
are the returning officers for the House of Representatives in their divisions and are

Quota

A system of voting in which the voter completes the ballot paper by putting the 
number ‘1’ in the box next to the candidate who is their first choice, the number 
‘2’ in the box next to their second choice, and so on until every box is numbered. 
This is called Full Preferential Voting and is the method used in the House of 
Representatives.

Preferential voting systems can also operate with further rules/minimum thresholds. 
This is the method of voting in a Senate election, where the voter completes the 
ballot paper above the line by putting the number ‘1’ in the box next to the group of 
candidates who is their first choice, the number ‘2’ in the box next to their second 
choice, and so on up to at least 6. Below the line voting is for individual candidates 
and the voter must preference at least 12 candidates. The voter can indicate 
further preferences both above the line and below the line if they so wish.

or where the elector has silent enrolment, or where, after questioning, the elector 
has failed to satisfy the officer in charge that they are a particular person on the 
certified list.

To be elected to the Senate, a candidate needs to gain a quota or proportion of

in the state or territory by one more than the number of Senators to be elected and 
adding ‘one’ to the result.
