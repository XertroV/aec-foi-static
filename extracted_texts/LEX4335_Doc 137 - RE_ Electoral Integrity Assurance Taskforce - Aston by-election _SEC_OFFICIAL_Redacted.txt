Hi 

,  

I hope you’ve been well and had an opportunity to speak with some of your colleagues. Looking to follow up and 
confirm the best referrals processes for content the AEC believes is in violation of your terms of service or breaches 
a law (Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 (Cth)). As I mentioned, we appreciate the different scale for the upcoming 
by-election compared to the referendum which we had been working towards. 

Kind regards,

Regarding formal campaign periods, there is no limit in the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 regarding the 
amount, the format or the timing of electoral communication. However, campaigning generally occurs between the 
issue of the writs and voting day. For the Aston by-election this will be Monday 27 February to Saturday 1 April.  
Other important dates to consider are the ’Close of Nominations’ which has been announced as midday Thursday 09 
March 2023 and the ‘Declaration of Nominations’ Friday 10 March 2023. By this point no further candidates will be 
able to nominate.  

I hope the above dates are helpful and please let me know if there is anything further I can clarify.  

Kind regards,  

.

Hi 

Please allow me to confirm with my colleagues whether the same support mechanisms will be in place for the by-
election, which is naturally very different in scale to the referendum.  

Is there are formal campaign period for the by-election?

I hope you’ve been well since we meet last week. As you may have seen, the Speaker of the House of 
Representatives, Hon Milton Dick MP, will soon issue the writ for the election of a new Member of the House of 
Representatives for the electoral division of Aston in Victoria. 
Voting day will take place on Saturday 1 April 2023.  

The Electoral Integrity Assurance Taskforce will again be stood up to provide assurance to the Australian Electoral 
Commissioner, as well as the Australian public, of the integrity of this electoral event.  
Thank you for your time in our recent meetings concerning the proposed referendum. The Taskforce will use the 
referrals processes confirmed in these meetings and existing contact points for the by-election. 

If you have any questions regarding the EIAT’s involvement in this event, please don’t hesitate to contact us.  

Kind regards,
