Great, thanks for coming back on this Julie.

Absolutely noted re: TT. I’d like to keep it in the overall budget and plan for now, otherwise this
causes some headaches for budgeting/Rule 18/updates to media plans. However, will strengthen the
language in the Minute – including that it’s possible TT could come out of the plan depending on
ongoing discussions and potential brand safety concerns – but that we’ve budgeted for it just in case.
Very easy to pull out of plans later, harder to add back!

FYI also – TT was in the mix as a potential paid media partner – as UM will be asking a number of
different social and audio platforms to give us a proposal on their ideas – so we’re doing a fair
approach to market, rather than direct selection. All outlets will go through a comprehensive
selection process and then we shortlist down. With your advice in mind, I’ll give UM a heads-up now
that any response from TT will need consideration with the brand safety lens in mind, which I suspect
will automatically push TT down the list. Also very happy for a rep from your team to be involved in
the shortlisting process 

Cheers,

Hi 

,

Thank you for the opportunity to review. One suggestion below and some commentary re. TikTok.

I note that the whole of gov approach to TikTok is moving along pretty quickly at the moment, you
may have seen in the media. I would be more comfortable if this was an ‘add in later if appropriate’,
rather than a ‘remove if required’ based on probabilities here, however acknowledge that this is a
perception risk so for the potential gain ELT may be willing to accept. We are expecting release of a
publicly mentioned review by Dept. of HA in the short term. I anticipate your contacts at Finance
should be across this however we will let you know when we hear more.

Cheers
Julie

Hi 

 and Julie

Hope all is well in your patch.

I’m contacting you to make sure you’re comfortable with some wording I’d like to include in a Minute
to ELT seeking approval of the referendum campaign paid media channel mix.

You might be interested in the note about Tik Tok too.

Are you ok with what’s below? Have run past Evan also. Love to hear back on any changes by EOD
tomorrow (or earlier if at all possible!).
