Hi 

and 

, 

As per processes and previous work we need to formally get es(cid:415)mates approved. If you could arrange to have signed and sent back that would be great. 

These are all as per the agreed SOW costs for the un-dated phase. Given we’re wai(cid:415)ng for a few elements to be conﬁrmed on ﬁlm we have started with: 

Etainer fees across ACM, planning and creative 

- 
-  Digital display 
- 
- 

Content & social 
Adbank 

We’ll formalise the TVC costs once we have confirmation on the Authorisation message, hopefully this week. 

Please let me know if there are any questions. 

Thanks, 

General Manager
