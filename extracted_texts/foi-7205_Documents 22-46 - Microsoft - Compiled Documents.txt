Hi 

As foreshadowed when we saw you a couple of weeks ago, I am delighted that 
Forward team will be visi(cid:415)ng Canberra on 22 January. You met 
Rogers. He works alongside 
world.  

 and 

 on the call we had with Commissioner 

 on our support for elec(cid:415)on commissions around the 

 from our Democracy 

I am keen to work with you on what engagements the AEC would ﬁnd useful. My early ideas are:

- 

Training for AEC team: ideally a 90 mins session and we can bring in as many folks as you would like. We 
can work with you on a program, but 
 and team run trainings for elec(cid:415)on oﬃcials globally on AI and 
synthe(cid:415)c media, dis and misinforma(cid:415)on, cyber security etc.  

-  Brieﬁng for EIAT: pick up where 

 le(cid:332) oﬀ with our insights post-US elec(cid:415)on, update on Au and regional 

speciﬁc insights, any other topics of interest to the group. We could also conduct some training for this 
group if we thought that would be useful.  

-  Mee(cid:415)ng with CIO and team: again, picking up where 

 le(cid:332) oﬀ and working with our account team and 

AEC on technical support for the elec(cid:415)on.  
1:1 with Ac(cid:415)ng Commissioner: if this would be a useful engagement. 

- 

It would be great to do some hinking in coming days so I can start to build 

 program this side of Christmas. 

Also, I believe we were wai(cid:415)ng on some follow up from your side following our mee(cid:415)ng with Commissioner Rogers –
please do let us know where this is up to and how we can help. 

Looking forward to our con(cid:415)nued engagement.

Hi 

I hope you are having a wonderful start to the new year.  

Ahead of 
conﬁrm some logis(cid:415)cs, agenda items and mee(cid:415)ng (cid:415)me conﬁrma(cid:415)ons.  

 visit to the AEC next Wednesday the 22nd of January, I wanted to reach out to 

Logis(cid:415)cs:  
  As 

 will be here at our Na(cid:415)onal Oﬃce for his 4 mee(cid:415)ngs, with some (cid:415)me in between, 

we wanted to conﬁrm if he will need an oﬃce space for the day? I are more than happy to arrange 
a mee(cid:415)ng room / or desk area for him to call his own for the day. If this is preferen(cid:415)al, please let 
me know the (cid:415)me-period he would like the space for (i.e. 9am -5pm) and I will work with our team 
to coordinate a suitable space. Thank you for this kind oﬀer. I think the only gaps are brief but we

Dear 

I hope this email ﬁnds you well. I thought that this email may be of interest to members of the EIAT and I would 
welcome you passing it on.  

I am wri(cid:415)ng to share some cri(cid:415)cal insights from the recently published Microso(cid:332) Digital Defense Report 2024, which 
outlines the evolving cybersecurity landscape and the impera(cid:415)ve ac(cid:415)ons required to safeguard our digital domains. 
This year’s report also has a focus on AI and cybersecurity. 

The depth and breadth of Microso(cid:332)’s presence in the digital ecosystem oﬀers a unique perspec(cid:415)ve that we share in 
this report. Every day we process more than 78 trillion security signals and our customers face more than 600 
million cybercriminal and na(cid:415)on-state a(cid:425)acks.  

As useful star(cid:415)ng points, I’d recommend the Execu(cid:415)ve Summary for Governments and Policymakers and blogpost 
from 

, Corporate Vice President for Customer Security and Trust. 

Key Highlights: 

  The lines between na(cid:415)on state actors and cybercriminals are increasingly blurred; na(cid:415)on states are now 

using cybercriminals and their tools to launch a(cid:425)acks.  

  Na(cid:415)on state ac(cid:415)vity was heavily concentrated around sites of ac(cid:415)ve military conﬂict or regional tension.  
  Russia, Iran and China all engaged in elec(cid:415)on inﬂuence eﬀorts this year, with the three actors converging on 

the upcoming US elec(cid:415)ons.  
Fraud and ﬁnancially mo(cid:415)vated cybercrime remains on the rise.  

 
  Cybercriminals are experimen(cid:415)ng with AI as an eﬃciency tool.  

You may also be par(cid:415)cularly interested in the sec(cid:415)on on elec(cid:415)on interference at pp 24-26.  

Microso(cid:332) will con(cid:415)nue to strengthen its security posture via its Secure Future Ini(cid:415)a(cid:415)ve (SFI), collaborate with the 
public and private sector to deter cybercrime and advocate for interna(cid:415)onal rules and norms to govern responsible 
use of cyber online. 

We look forward to con(cid:415)nuing to engage with you closely on these important issues

I have received the a(cid:425)ached response from the CEO Microso(cid:332) Australia to my le(cid:425)er to tech companies in mid-

Acting Electoral Commissioner 
Australian Electoral Commission 
via email: 

Microsoft’s commitment to the ‘AI Elections Accord’ and Australia’s upcoming Federal 
Election 

Dear Mr Pope 

Thank you for your letter of 17 December 2024. Please see below an update from Microsoft on 
measures implemented to meet the commitments agreed to as a signatory of the Tech Accord to 
Combat Deceptive Use of AI in 2024 Elections.  

Since the adoption of the Tech Accord in February 2024, Microsoft has made significant strides to 
prevent the creation of deceptive AI targeting elections, enhance detection and response 
capabilities, and improve transparency and public awareness.  

Microsoft’s Democracy Forward team works closely with campaigns, electoral commissions and 
other entities around the world to support the integrity of the elections, and Microsoft’s Threat 
Analysis Center (MTAC) analyses nation-state threats to provide intelligence and insights on 
cyberattacks and influence operations. In 2024, this took us to a range of jurisdictions, including 
Taiwan, India, the UK, the EU and the US.  

We are bringing this same approach to the forthcoming Australian federal election in 2025. 

We are committed to a set of election protection principles to help safeguard voters, candidates 
and campaigns, and election authorities worldwide. These principles are: 

•  Voters have a right to transparent and authoritative information regarding elections. 

•  Candidates should be able to assert when content originates from their campaign and have 
recourse when their likeness or content is distorted by AI for the purpose of deceiving the 
public during the course of an election. 

•  Political campaigns should protect themselves from cyber threats and be able to navigate 

AI with access to affordable and easily deployed tools, trainings, and support. 

•  Election authorities should be able to ensure a secure and resilient election process and 

have access to tools and services that enable this process. 

Further to our September 2024 progress update, this document sets out further detail on the steps 
we have and are taking to implement the Accord in the lead-up to Australia’s federal election in 
2025.

Addressing Deepfake Creation  

We recognise that companies whose products are used to create AI generated content have a 
responsibility to ensure images and videos generated from their systems include indicators of their 
origin. One way to accomplish this is through content provenance, enabled by an open standard 
created by the Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity (C2PA). Microsoft is a founding 
member of C2PA and has leveraged this standard (“Content Credentials”) across several of our 
products, ensuring that AI generated content is marked as such and that the creator and 
timestamp of images is recorded.  

Specifically, Microsoft has added Content Credentials to all images created with our most popular 
consumer facing AI image generation tools, including Bing Image Creator, Microsoft Designer, 
Copilot, and in our enterprise API image generation tools including Azure OpenAI DALL-E. We 
recently started testing a Content Credentials display in Word. When images with Content 
Credentials are inserted into Word documents, future viewers will be able to right click and see the 
credits and author information of these images. In addition, images with Content Credentials 
uploaded to LinkedIn are automatically labeled and the credential information is shown to end 
users.  

As important as it is to mark content as AI generated, a healthy information ecosystem relies on 
other indicators of authenticity as well. We launched and expanded our Content Integrity Tools to 
support  global elections in 2024 - through the creation of a pilot program that allows political 
campaigns, elections authorities, and select news media organizations globally, to access a tool 
that enables them to easily apply Content Credentials to their own authentic images and videos.  

We also joined forces with fellow Tech Accord signatory Truepic. Microsoft and Truepic have jointly 
released an app that simplifies the process of adding Content Credentials to authentically 
captured smartphone camera images, video, and audio for participants of the pilot. This app has 
now launched for both Android and Apple devices and can be used by those enrolled in Content 
Credentials program.  

Detecting and Responding to Deepfakes  

Microsoft is harnessing the data science and technical capabilities of our AI for Good Lab and 
Microsoft Threat Analysis Centre (MTAC) teams to better assess whether content—including that 
created and disseminated by foreign actors—is synthetic or not. Microsoft’s AI for Good lab has 
developed and is using detection models (image, video) to assess whether media was g enerated 
or manipulated by AI. We can use this detection capability in the context of election campaigns to 
support integrity. 

We are also working with our partners at True Media to provide governments, civil society and 
journalists with access to free tools that enable them to check whether an image or video was AI 
generated and/or manipulated. Microsoft’s contribution includes providing True Media with access 
to Microsoft classifiers, tools, personnel, and data. These contributions will enable True Media to 
train AI detection models, share relevant data, evaluate and refine new detection models as well as 
provide feedback on quality and classification methodologies.  

 
We are also empowering candidates, campaigns and election authorities to help us detect and 
respond to deceptive AI that is targeting elections. In February we launched the Microsoft-2024 
Elections site. This site empowers candidates, campaigns or election authorities to directly report 
deceptive AI election content on Microsoft consumer services. This reporting tool allows for 24/7 
reporting by impacted election entities who have been targeted by deceptive AI found on Microsoft 
platforms.  

Transparency and Resilience  

In advance of the EU elections we kicked off a global effort to engage campaigns and elections 
authorities. This enabled us to deepen understanding of the possible risks of deceptive AI in 
elections and empower those campaigns and election officials to speak directly to their voters 
about these risks and the steps they can take to build resilience and increase confidence in the 
election. So far this year we have conducted more than 200 training sessions for political 
stakeholders in 23 countries, reaching more than 6,000 participants. We are working closely with 
the Australian Electoral Commission along with political and media stakeholders in Australia, to 
provide support in preparation for the next federal election.  

Building on this training, we have established a public website entitled “Check, Recheck, Vote,” 
which educates voters of the possible risks posed by deepfakes and empowers them to take steps 
to identify trusted sources of election information, look for indicators of trust like content 
provenance, and pause before they link to or share election content. This includes our ‘Real or 
Not?’ Quiz, developed by our AI for Good lab to expose users to the challenges of detecting a 
possible deepfake. So far, individuals from 150+ countries have taken the quiz. We are exploring 
similar activities in Australia.  

Protecting Campaign and Election Infrastructure  

Since the 2016 US election, adversaries have regularly targeted essential systems that support 
elections and campaigns in the US to advance their cyber enabled influence operations. Recent 
Iranian hacking incidents involved attempts by these actors to provide stolen or allegedly stolen 
material to the media to propagate narratives of dissent and distrust. This underscores why we 
continue to invest in efforts that focus on safeguarding the critical infrastructure that underpins our 
elections.  

Our efforts include several initiatives designed to support election officials and political 
organizations. First, we offer AccountGuard, a no-cost cybersecurity service available to our cloud 
email customers in 35 countries, including Australia. This service provides advanced threat 
detection and notifications against nation-state adversaries for high-risk customers, including 
those involved in elections. AccountGuard extends beyond commercial customers to individuals at 
election organizations, their affiliates, and immediate family members who may use personal 
Microsoft accounts for email. We have observed that sophisticated adversaries often target both 
professional and personal accounts, amplifying the need for comprehensive protection. More than 
5.4 million mailboxes of high-risk users are now protected by AccountGuard globally.  

 
For critical election-adjacent systems, such as voter registration databases and voter information 
portals, we provide our Azure for Election service. This service provides proactive security reviews, 
resilience assessments, and load analysis. During the election week, we offer our highest tier of 
reactive support to address any security or availability issues that may arise.  

In the upcoming election in Australia, as per previous federal and state electoral events, we 
establish a dedicated escalation point staffed by our team to provide constant management and 
triage of any election-sensitive issues and maintain real-time communications across our industry 
partners. This ensured that any incidents received the highest level of priority and executive 
support.  

While we continue to provide robust security services, we recognize that collaboration is essential. 
Public-private partnerships are crucial in strengthening the entire ecosystem. For example, our 
Democracy Forward team actively participates in tabletop cybersecurity training exercises 
convened by US election officials.  

Microsoft remains steadfast in its commitment to supporting the security and integrity of 
democratic processes. Through our comprehensive programs and collaborative efforts, we aim to 
protect democracy from the evolving threats posed by nation-state actors.  

We look forward to supporting the AEC during the upcoming electoral period, including through the 
visit to Canberra in late January by executives from our Democracy Forward team.

Hi 

I hope this email finds you well. 

At our last two Microsoft meetings we have been offered the opportunity to have prominent people (such as our 
Electoral Commissioner, Tom Rogers) blocked from having their image created on Microsoft’s AI image generating 
tools. 

There is interest in this from some of our executive so I am reaching out for more information, including what you 
would need from us to make this happen. 

I’d be grateful for any information or direction you could provide, and very happy to chat further if needed. 

Kind regards,

Dear

On behalf of

 I wanted to express our gra(cid:415)tude for the opportunity to meet with you on January 

 and 

As discussed with the Ac(cid:415)ng Commissioner, we will arrange a follow up security brieﬁng in coming months and look 
forward to speaking with your team about content escala(cid:415)on response mechanisms.  

As promised in the Cyber brieﬁng, also sharing some links for more informa(cid:415)on on AccountGuard and Democracy

Hi again

  Will

o  DDU group line 
o  Skye desk phone 
o  Tanya desk phone

If all else fails, the security guards at the front should be able to help. You will need to check in with 
them in any case at the beginning of the day. 

 

 in rela(cid:415)on to your kind oﬀer to extend our mee(cid:415)ng to 4.30pm, poten(cid:415)ally to run over some scenarios, 

we will be sending a reminder email to TF a(cid:425)endees this a(cid:332)ernoon and will let them know they are 
welcome to stay on un(cid:415)l 4.30pm if they are available.  

o  The TF agencies are currently reviewing a dra(cid:332) of a proposed set of scenarios the DDU has put 
together, and these are due to be circulated to pla(cid:414)orms (including Microso(cid:332)) in the next few 
weeks. To avoid confusion, I might suggest using the extra (cid:415)me for round table type discussion and 
ques(cid:415)ons – I think we will have plenty to keep us busy in this regard! Great, we will plan to stay 
un(cid:415)l 4:30 and I will talk to 
 tomorrow about having some scenarios ready to discuss if the 
conversa(cid:415)on goes that way. He is very experienced and running these sessions, so won’t be a 
problem to do “on the ﬂy” so to speak.

Hi 

 and 

Just wanted to close the loop on a suggested change to the schedule of Microso(cid:332) mee(cid:415)ngs here on 
Wednesday. If this has already been addressed, then please disregard. 

Given it has been suggested that the mee(cid:415)ngs with the CIOD (Tania Wilson’s area) and the EC (Jeﬀ) be 
combined into one mee(cid:415)ng for the Execu(cid:415)ve Leadership Team (ELT), I just wanted to make sure 

 and 

 had enough (cid:415)me to prepare/make adjustments and to conﬁrm what (cid:415)me the combined mee(cid:415)ng 

would take place. 

If the mee(cid:415)ngs are to be combined, then the agenda would include exis(cid:415)ng items prepared for the CIO 
and the following items that the EC is interested in: 

  Executive level briefing on Cyber threat landscape (MTAC/MSTIC insights) 
  Synthetic media - including AI and the practical application of detecting / content provenance + 

credentialing / Microsoft's 'AI for good lab' initiative.

  Mis/disinformation and Microsoft's efforts in this space, especially media and digital literacy.  
Insights from elections in other geographies, for example major common themes / concerns  
 

Potentially in addition to some, or all, of the following items suggested by 

 (time permitting): 

  support for electoral preparations from the technical/customer support perspective;  
  content credentialling and pilot next steps; 
  synthetic media and AI related harms, including advice on how to respond to incidents 
  overview of the Democracy Forward visit program including training for political campaigns and 

journalists; 

  update on implementation of the Tech Accord (as per correspondence this month)  
  any other topics of interest 

 – if not already aware, please let us know if any issues with this change.

Hi 

Following up on our conversa(cid:415)on from earlier, it looks like our Communica(cid:415)ons colleagues have been working on 
this, and I believe 

 may now already have spoken to you. Let me know if not and I’d be happy to chase up again. 

Also, not sure if this is informa(cid:415)on you are able to share, but we are aware of Microso(cid:332) being one of the recipients 
of a subpoena from the US House Judiciary Chairman Jordan Subpoenas Big Tech for Informa(cid:415)on on Foreign 
Censorship of American Speech | House Judiciary Commi(cid:425)ee Republicans and would like to know if you can tell us 
the due date.  

As you know, with the elec(cid:415)on coming up, it would be good to understand (cid:415)melines and therefore be prepared if 
we are asked ques(cid:415)ons once informa(cid:415)on is released. There are plenty of other things we can be doing if it won’t be 
an issue un(cid:415)l a(cid:332)er the elec(cid:415)on! 

Happy to discuss if that’s easier and understand if you can’t answer.

Following up on a couple of items. First, setting up a meeting with LinkedIn reps. I have put a placeholder in Matt’s

works, otherwise can look for other times that are suitable.

Hi 

We hope you are well – happy new year!  

’s visit is fast approaching. I have included him at cc so we can reﬁne some details on desired content for the 

engagements with AEC on Wednesday.  

1)  Brieﬁng with AEC Cyber Branch with ASD and ACSC 

a. 

 has been working with our colleagues in the Microso(cid:332) Threat Analysis Centre (MTAC) and the 
Microso(cid:332) Threat Intelligence Centre (MSTIC) on latest shareable threat insights which he will share.  

 can also share the latest on cybersecurity best prac(cid:415)ce and other technical supports. 

 from MSTIC, 

, will also join this mee(cid:415)ng.  

b.  Our colleague 
c. 
d. 
e. 

Is there anything in par(cid:415)cular that you would like to cover? 
Is it possible to share the list of a(cid:425)endees? 

2)  Brieﬁng with the AEC Ac(cid:415)ng Commissioner  

a.  We are keen for your advice on how the Commissioner would like to use this (cid:415)me and who else will 

be a(cid:425)ending.  

b.  As you know from our most recent engagements with Democracy Forward the last few months of 

2024, there is a lot that week can cover and want to ensure we are prepared to meet the 
Commissioners interests.  
c.  Some suggested topics include: 

i.  execu(cid:415)ve level brieﬁng on the cyber threat landscape (MTAC/MSTIC insights);  
ii.  support for electoral prepara(cid:415)ons from the technical/customer support perspec(cid:415)ve;  
iii.  content creden(cid:415)alling and pilot next steps; 
iv.  synthe(cid:415)c media and AI related harms, including advice on how to respond to incidents

and journalists; 

vi.  update on implementa(cid:415)on of the Tech Accord (as per correspondence this month)  
vii.  any other topics of interest 

3)  Brieﬁng with EIAT 

a.  As per 
b. 

’s visit, this discussion can be shaped as it best suits the interests of the Taskforce.  

It would be great to have a list of a(cid:425)endees, or at least Departments/Agencies that will be 
represented.

v.  update on implementa(cid:415)on of the Tech Accord (as per correspondence this month)  
vi.  any other topics of interest 

d.  While we only have an hour, if there are any other scenario based exercises or planning that we can 

prepare to support the EIAT with please let us know.  

i.  We would have (cid:415)me in Ethan’s program to extend this mee(cid:415)ng to 90 mins to accommodate 

this if that was of interest.  

4)  Brieﬁng with Defending Democracy Branch 

a.  You may have had enough of us by the end of the day, but we have (cid:415)me following the EIAT for a 

short mee(cid:415)ng with your Branch if there is anything outstanding or more opera(cid:415)onal that you would 
like to cover while we are there. 

b.  Please feel free to schedule 30 mins if that is something that would be valuable. We could also ﬁt 

this in immediately before the Cyber Branch mee(cid:415)ng if a pre-brief in person was useful. 

I have not included the CIO mee(cid:415)ng above, which is scheduled and being led by our account team who will join 

 for that mee(cid:415)ng.  

I am oﬄine tomorrow but happy to connect by phone on Monday. That being said, if you can, a short wri(cid:425)en 
response would be helpful for 

’s visibility as he ﬂies over the weekend.  

We are looking forward to these engagements.

Happy New Year everyone! 

I am wondering if you could please re-send the placeholder for the Cyber Briefing at 11-12pm on Wed 22 January?  

 we are now planning to have 

 in Canberra on Thursday 23 January also. While it would be my 

preference to have all the AEC and related meetings on 22 January, it does give us some more space to fit in the 
various engagements, including time with EIMB.

Hi 

Thanks for your email, 22 January is looking good for us (always with the caveat that it depends on whether the 
election has been called!). It would be great to hear from 

 in person. 

I have reached out to the a/g EC’s office, and he is amenable to a meeting with 
shortly for 1.30pm to 2.30pm on 22 January.  Let me know if this isn’t suitable.  

 – I’ll forward a meeting invite 

For our team here in the EIMB we would be interested in hearing about: 

synthetic media (including AI and the practical application of detecting/content provenance)  
 
  mis/disinformation and Microsoft’s efforts in this space, especially media and digital literacy 
 

in addition to some of our EIAT colleagues, we have an area in the AEC who would be interested in hearing 
about regional specific insights since the AEC works directly with EMBs in the Pacific to provide support 

Probably not for 22 January, but it would also be good to line up a check-in with LinkedIn reps some time before the 
next election. We can sort that out in the new year if that suits. 

I will also send you a meeting invite for an EIAT brief on 22 January and get back to before I go on leave for next 
week with potential topics. 

Lastly, I have sent an email to the CIO’s team to make sure they are aware of your visit (not sure if you have also 
contacted them separately). Let me know if you would like any assistance in this space. 

Talk soon,

Hi 

As foreshadowed when we saw you a couple of weeks ago, I am delighted that 
Forward team will be visiting Canberra on 22 January. You met 
Rogers. He works alongside 
world.  

 and 

 on the call we had with Commissioner 

 on our support for election commissions around the 

 from our Democracy 

I am keen to work with you on what engagements the AEC would find useful. My early ideas are: 

  Training for AEC team: ideally a 90 mins session and we can bring in as many folks as you would like. We 
 and team run trainings for election officials globally on AI and 

can work with you on a program, but 
synthetic media, dis and misinformation, cyber security etc.  

  Briefing for EIAT: pick up where 

 left off with our insights post-US election, update on Au and regional 

specific insights, any other topics of interest to the group. We could also conduct some training for this 
group if we thought that would be useful.  

  Meeting with CIO and team: again, picking up where 

 left off and working with our account team and 

AEC on technical support for the election.  

  1:1 with Acting Commissioner: if this would be a useful engagement. 

It would be great to do some hinking in coming days so I can start to build 

’s program this side of Christmas. 

Also, I believe we were waiting on some follow up from your side following our meeting with Commissioner Rogers 
– please do let us know where this is up to and how we can help. 

Looking forward to our continued engagement.

 

in addition to some of our EIAT colleagues, we have an area in the AEC who would be interested in hearing 
about regional specific insights since the AEC works directly with EMBs in the Pacific to provide support 

Probably not for 22 January, but it would also be good to line up a check-in with LinkedIn reps some time before the

I will also send you a meeting invite for an EIAT brief on 22 January and get back to before I go on leave for next

Lastly, I have sent an email to the CIO’s team to make sure they are aware of your visit (not sure if you have also 
contacted them separately). Let me know if you would like any assistance in this space.

Hi 

 Defending Democracy 

Of course, thanks for US public holiday reminder! In that case, the following week we have availability at the same 
(cid:415)me on Tuesday, 16 July (Monday 15 July for US).  
Otherwise, some op(cid:415)ons the week a(cid:332)er that on either 23 or 24 July AUS (22/23 July US). 

Many thanks,

Hi 

I hope you have had a good week. I was touching base to follow up on a few details ahead of 

’s visit on 23rd.  

In par(cid:415)cular, keen to have advice early next week on who from the EIAT will be a(cid:425)ending, as well as a desired 
agenda.  

Dave would like to have (cid:415)me to prepare to address the areas of most interest to the Taskforce. He will have some 
slides to present so let us know if connec(cid:415)ng his computer to present will be possible or if he needs to prepare and 
send through in advance (less preferred as he has a lot of content he can dip into depending on where the 
discussion goes, if he can present he will keep that ﬂexibility). 

With regards to a (cid:415)me to meet 
in Singapore, I understand from 
and there will be lots of opportuni(cid:415)es to catch up – Dave looks forward to upda(cid:415)ng him on the conversa(cid:415)ons he will 
have just had in Canberra, among other things.

  Ma(cid:425)’s availability to meet up with

Also, I have forwarded your email to the relevant members of Tania Wilson’s team so they can also arrange a

Just wanted to close the loop on a suggested change to the schedule of Microso(cid:332) mee(cid:415)ngs here on 
Wednesday. If this has already been addressed, then please disregard. 

Given it has been suggested that the mee(cid:415)ngs with the CIOD (Tania Wilson’s area) and the EC (Jeﬀ) be 
combined into one mee(cid:415)ng for the Execu(cid:415)ve Leadership Team (ELT), I just wanted to make sure 

 and 

 had enough (cid:415)me to prepare/make adjustments and to conﬁrm what (cid:415)me the combined mee(cid:415)ng 

would take place. 

If the mee(cid:415)ngs are to be combined, then the agenda would include exis(cid:415)ng items prepared for the CIO 
and the following items that the EC is interested in: 

  Executive level briefing on Cyber threat landscape (MTAC/MSTIC insights) 
  Synthetic media - including AI and the practical application of detecting / content provenance + 

credentialing / Microsoft's 'AI for good lab' initiative. 

  Mis/disinformation and Microsoft's efforts in this space, especially media and digital literacy.  
Insights from elections in other geographies, for example major common themes / concerns  
 

Potentially in addition to some, or all, of the following items suggested by 

 (time permitting): 

  support for electoral preparations from the technical/customer support perspective;  
  content credentialling and pilot next steps; 
  synthetic media and AI related harms, including advice on how to respond to incidents 
  overview of the Democracy Forward visit program including training for political campaigns and 

journalists; 

  update on implementation of the Tech Accord (as per correspondence this month)  
  any other topics of interest 

 – if not already aware, please let us know if any issues with this change.  

 – let me know if there is anything I can do to help. 

Cheers, 

| Assistant Director

Subject: [EXTERNAL] RSVPs and agenda items: in person brieﬁng from MSFT Democracy Forward at AEC 
[SEC=OFFICIAL] 

Good morning 

Thanks for checking in! 

A(cid:425)endance 
To date, we have had responses conﬁrming a(cid:425)endance from ASD (x1), ONI (x2) and DITRDCA (Infrastructure x 1). 
This is in addi(cid:415)on to AEC a(cid:425)endance ( x3-4). The rest have just been nil response rather than declined. I will send out 
a reminder today, along with an op(cid:415)on for those that can’t a(cid:425)end to submit ques(cid:415)ons/areas of interest which I can 
provide in a follow up email. 

Presen(cid:415)ng 
In rela(cid:415)on to presen(cid:415)ng, it won’t be an issue for us to grant Dave presenter permission to make life easy for him. I’ll 
check in with the people who know how to manage this to make sure it’s good to go for next Monday. 

Agenda items 
I haven’t put together a formal agenda, but can ﬂag that areas of interest will include the following: 

  What has Microso(cid:332) observed or learned in rela(cid:415)on to how electoral integrity* has been 

managed/maintained globally this year? 

o  What has happened that you were expec(cid:415)ng? 
o  What has surprised you (both posi(cid:415)ve and nega(cid:415)ve)? 
o  What could Australia learn from this? 

  How has Microso(cid:332) adapted its approach to elec(cid:415)ons based on what it has learned so far this year? 
  What are some useful (or terrible!) approaches to mi(cid:415)ga(cid:415)ng threats to electoral integrity that you have 

observed from other pla(cid:414)orms and/or from other electoral management bodies? 

  What are Microso(cid:332)’s insights (if any) into the Sovereign Ci(cid:415)zen movement? 
  How big an impact do you assess AI has had on elec(cid:415)ons to date? 

o  The existence of AI generated mis and disinforma(cid:415)on, deepfakes etc does not necessarily correlate 

with impact 

*We usually consider threats to electoral integrity in terms of cyber, mis/disinforma(cid:415)on, physical threats and foreign 
interference, but of course there is plenty of overlap between these four areas. 

Also, ONI reps queried whether your teams are aware of ONI’s ongoing discussions to contract support from 
Microso(cid:332) Threat Intelligence Center (MSTIC) and Microso(cid:332) Threat Analysis Center (MTAC). They didn’t ﬂag any 
ques(cid:415)ons or issues but might appreciate an update on whether you are aware of this and how the Democracy 
Forward team interacts with the other two. 

Lastly, Ma(cid:425) is copied in, but I will follow up to ﬂag that 
no doubt he would be keen for a chat. 

 will be at the conference in Singapore next week. I have 

I’ll check in with you again in the next day or two to update you on RSVPs and whether anyone has replied with a 
ques(cid:415)on or area of interest to cover. 

Many thanks,

Hi 

I hope you have had a good week. I was touching base to follow up on a few details ahead of 

’s visit on 23rd.  

In par(cid:415)cular, keen to have advice early next week on who from the EIAT will be a(cid:425)ending, as well as a desired 
agenda.  

 would like to have (cid:415)me to prepare to address the areas of most interest to the Taskforce. He will have some 

slides to present so let us know if connec(cid:415)ng his computer to present will be possible or if he needs to prepare and 
send through in advance (less preferred as he has a lot of content he can dip into depending on where the 
discussion goes, if he can present he will keep that ﬂexibility). 

With regards to a (cid:415)me to meet Ma(cid:425)hew in Singapore, I understand from 
and there will be lots of opportuni(cid:415)es to catch up – 
have just had in Canberra, among other things. 

 looks forward to upda(cid:415)ng him on the conversa(cid:415)ons he will 

 that the conference is quite small

Hi Ma(cid:425)hew 

I am pleased to share that 
Monday 23 September. You will recall that 

 from Microso(cid:332)’s Democracy Forward team will be visi(cid:415)ng Canberra on 

 presented to you and colleagues a few weeks ago.  

 has oﬀered to provide an in-person brieﬁng to the Electoral Integrity and Assurance Taskforce on what 

Microso(cid:332) has been seeing and doing globally in this year of elec(cid:415)ons. As the EIAT prepares for the next federal 
elec(cid:415)on, and in the weeks before the US Presiden(cid:415)al Elec(cid:415)ons, his visit is very (cid:415)mely. I think this discussion would 
be very insigh(cid:414)ul for the EIAT.  

 is only in Canberra for one day, convening the Taskforce reps together will help us to reach all the key 

Given 
people. We would propose a roundtable format of 60-90 minutes, depending on what you think would be most 
useful for the Taskforce, to comprise a brieﬁng from 

 then group discussion.  

We would welcome your team’s assistance with arranging this event if that is possible? We have an appropriate 
venue at our Canberra oﬃce on Na(cid:415)onal Circuit if needed, but are also happy to come to you or another agency.
