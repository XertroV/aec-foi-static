Hi 

, 

No worries at all, we understand how busy you and the team have been. Grateful for your help in 
coordinating the relevant team members and their availabilities. 

Are there any time zone considerations that we need to take into account? Unfortunately, not much 
availability in the last week of July, but we have 9-10am AEST as a possibility on either the 23rd or 24th of 
July.  

Let me know if either of those dates would work for you, as well as any team members you’d like to 
attend, and we can get a Teams calendar invite sent out to you.  

Many thanks,

Hi

I hope you and the team are well.  

My sincere apologies for the delay in responding to you. We would welcome the opportunity to continue 
to work closely and positively with the AEC in relation to election integrity.  

Do you have availability towards the end of July? 

We will pull together team members who are able to respond to these matters and prepare appropriate 
briefing materials. If you have anything else you would like us to cover please let me know.  

Look forward to working with you.

Hi 

,  

I hope you’ve been well. The Australian Electoral Commission has appreciated the productive 
engagement we’ve had with Google in the past, and while the date for the next Australian federal 
election is yet to be determined by the government, we are keeping a close eye on developments in this 
‘year of elections’ around the world, particularly advancements in generative AI technology. 

With that in mind, we are very interested in meeting with representatives from Google’s AI team to 
learn more about the following:  

 Any observations and lessons learned from recent elections around the globe and how 
these experiences are shaping your work on generative AI; 

 How Google is responding to electoral integrity risks when it comes to generative AI 
products like Gemini, with a particular focus on how we can ensure the Australian public has 
access to timely and accurate information about the electoral process; 

 A brief overview of SynthID including how it identifies AI-generated content; 

 Discussing pathways for the Elecoral Integrity Assurance Taskforce (EIAT) and the AEC to 
flag potential issues with you in relation to Australian federal electoral events and AI products 
like Gemini, and whether this would differ from our existing pathway.

Hi 

Thanks for your help in ﬁnding a (cid:415)me for this mee(cid:415)ng. As a guide, we are seeking to cover the following: 

1.  The AEC will provide an update on Australia’s electoral integrity environment and the work of the Electoral 

Integrity Assurance Taskforce (EIAT) 

2.  An update from Google and YouTube about observations and lessons learned from recent elections around 
the globe and how these experiences are shaping your work (especially as the US election draws nearer) 
3.  Discussion about how Google and YouTube are responding to electoral integrity risks, with a particular focus 
on how we can prevent the harassment and intimidation of electoral workers- particularly where this is 
posted online 

4.  Discussion of the FE24/25 version of the Online Platform Scenarios, which, although similar to the 

Referendum scenarios, has had some updates 

5.  Any other updates Google/YouTube would like to cover, e.g. developments in genAI 

Please let me know if you would like to discuss or clarify any of this prior to the meeting- I’d be very happy 
to do so. 

Cheers,

Hi 

, 

Thanks so much for sharing this! Our strong preference would be for videos that fit the YT format - 
so either longform or Shorts but ideally not square - as well as content made specifically for the 
upcoming election in 2025. 

Will check in with you closer to the date to finalise the list. 

Thanks again!

Good morning 

, 

Bringing to your attention a video with 75k+ views that our Social Media Team reported yesterday:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xcrxUCoiPIU 

From 5:18 it claims that there will be digital ID requirements for FE25, which is incorrect. Our team 
referred this under ‘misinformation’ as follows: 

The video’s claim that “digital identity verification for voting” has been introduced for the 2025 federal 
election is false. ID is not required when voting in Australian federal elections, and there have been no 
recent changes in this area. 

The erroneous claim presents the following risks: 

 Disenfranchising Australian voters who view the video and believe they won’t be able to vote due to 
not having a digital ID. (Or that they may not be able to vote if they haven’t linked a digital ID to 
their enrolment). 

 Damaging the perceived integrity of Australian federal elections due to the implication voter privacy 

may be compromised. 

As of this morning it’s still up/unlabelled/unmoderated but it was only referred yesterday afternoon. 

The election hasn’t been called yet, but the social media team are already feeling it! 

Also , thanks for the link you shared after our meeting earlier this week. That page is helpful – I think we 
believed it was more complicated than it was.

Jeff Pope APM  
Acting Electoral Commissioner  
Australian Electoral Commission  
10-12 Mort Street 
Canberra ACT 2600 

Dear Acting Commissioner 

Thank you for your letter of December 17, 2024 regarding Google's commitment to the Tech Accord to Combat 
Deceptive Use of AI in 2024 Elections and its relevance to Australia’s upcoming federal election. We appreciate the 
Australian Electoral Commission's (AEC) ongoing collaboration with online platforms and share your commitment to 
maintaining public trust in Australia's democratic processes. Google recognises the potential risks AI poses to electoral 
integrity and welcomes the opportunity to provide an update on our efforts to address these challenges. 

Google has long been dedicated to supporting democratic processes by: 

●  Surfacing high-quality information to voters 
●  Safeguarding our platforms from abuse, and 
●  Equipping campaigns with best-in-class security tools and training. 

These three pillars are fundamental to maintaining public trust in elections and include our platforms and services 
providing the following: 

●  Google promotes information on how to vote on Google Search's landing page to increase voter awareness 

and democratic participation. 

●  YouTube prominently surfaces content from authoritative sources on the homepage, in search results, and the 

"Up Next" panel for election news and information. 

●  Google monitors and tackles coordinated influence operations through the Google Threat Intelligence group, 
which includes intelligence and threat response across Google’s Threat Analysis Group, Cloud Security and 
Mandiant teams. 

●  For over a decade, Google has leveraged machine learning classifiers and AI to identify and remove content 

that violates policies regarding manipulated media, hate and harassment, incitement to violence, and 
demonstrably false claims that could undermine democratic processes. 

●  Google offers free security services like the Advanced Protection Program and Project Shield to high-risk users 
such as campaigners and journalists to ensure they have additional account security protections in place. 

Addressing AI-Related Misinformation 

We understand the AEC's concerns regarding the use of AI to spread election-related misinformation and 
disinformation, including deepfakes and coordinated inauthentic behaviour. Google has implemented several 
measures to mitigate these risks across our products and services: 

●  AI and Generative AI policies: Google has policies that address misinformation and disinformation in the 
context of AI.  For example, YouTube's misinformation policies prohibit technically manipulated content that 
misleads users and could pose a serious risk of egregious harm.  

 Page 1 of 3 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
●  Ads disclosures: Google requires advertisers to disclose when their election ads include synthetic content 
that inauthentically depicts real or realistic-looking people or events. This policy applies to image, video, and 
audio content. Google's ads policies already prohibit the use of manipulated media to mislead people, such as 
deep fakes or doctored content. 

●  Content labels on YouTube: YouTube requires creators to disclose when they've created realistic altered or 
synthetic content and displays a label indicating that the content is synthetic. For election-related content, 
YouTube displays a prominent label on the video player for added transparency. 

●  Responsible approach to Generative AI products: Google has prioritised testing across safety risks, 
including misinformation, for Generative AI products like Gemini. Google has restricted the types of 
election-related queries for which Gemini will return responses. 

●  Watermarking: Google attaches invisible watermarks to imagery generated by Google's models using 

SynthID, a watermarking technology developed by Google DeepMind. 

●  Providing users with additional context: "About this image" in Search helps people assess the credibility and 
context of images found online. The double-check feature in Gemini enables people to evaluate whether 
there's content across the web to substantiate a Gemini response. 

Progress Against the Tech Accord Commitments 

Google was among the original signatories of the Tech Accord to Combat Deceptive Use of AI in 2024 Elections. In line 
with our commitments, we have taken steps across our products to reduce the risks that deceptive AI election content 
may pose to the integrity of electoral processes. These steps include: 

●  Developing Model Cards to promote transparency and a shared understanding of AI models 
●  Addressing harmful content through Google's AI Prohibited Use Policy 
●  Proactively testing systems using AI-Assisted Red Teaming 
●  Restricting responses for election-related queries across many Generative AI consumer apps and experiences 
●  Expanding the SynthID watermarking toolkit to more Generative AI tools and more forms of media 
●  Requiring election advertisers to prominently disclose when their ads include realistic synthetic content 
●  Adding Google-generated disclosures for some YouTube Election Ads formats, and 
●  Actively exploring ways to incorporate Content Credentials into our own products and services, including Ads, 

Search, and YouTube, as a Steering Committee member of the C2PA Coalition and Standard. 

Collaboration and Transparency 

Google is committed to transparency and collaboration with industry, government, and civil society. We actively share 
our learnings and expertise with researchers and others in the industry. We engage and collaborate with organisations 
such as the Partnership on AI, ML Commons, and the Frontier Model Forum. We also support the Global Fact Check 
Fund and numerous civil society, research, and media literacy efforts. 

Looking Ahead 

Google's efforts around elections are not limited to a specific timeframe or region. We will continue to support and 
protect elections around the world and in Australia by: 

●  Surfacing high-quality information to voters 
●  Safeguarding our platforms from abuse 
●  Equipping campaigns with best-in-class security tools and training 
●  Applying new learnings to improve our protections for harmful content and create trustworthy experiences 
●  Leveraging machine learning classifiers and AI to identify and remove content that violates our policies, and 
●  Taking a principled and responsible approach to introducing generative AI products.

RE: Action items from October meeting, including proposed dates for December 
meeting [SEC=OFFICIAL]

Thanks for your reply. I’ll send a calendar invite shortly to lock in next Monday, 16 December 10am to 11am. 

- will this include the information session about Google, or should we arrange a time for that early next year? 

Happy to discuss if needed.

Hi 

, 

Thank you so much for following up on your email and our apologies for the delayed response in getting 
back to you. You’re spot on in that the decks have been very full over the last few weeks with the 
legislative and reform agenda.  

We would be delighted to connect before the break. Perhaps we try for 16, 17 or 18. Are those times still 
workable from your end?  

Cheers,

I realise the two of you would have been exceptionally busy over the last couple of weeks! Just bringing 
this back to the top of your inbox. 

If the below times aren’t workable due to your current workload, just let me know and I’d be happy to 
offer up some times in January.

Subject: Action items from October meeting, including proposed dates for December meeting 

Good afternoon 

, 

I hope this email finds you both well and you’re both on track for a relaxing Christmas break. I thought it 
would be good to follow up on a few action items from our last meeting before December arrives, as 
follows. 

Information session 

 

- at our last meeting you kindly offered to set up an information quality session to outline how 
Google search worked, including an element on searches in Gemini. We would like to take you up 
on that offer.  

o  Please let me know what time frames/notice you need to set this up and I would be happy 

to set up some meeting invites 

o  If we work a couple of weeks in advance, most of our working level attendees will be free to 

attend 

Gemini’s incorrect answer about enrolling to vote 

 

- on 23 October we flagged that Gemini was producing an incorrect answer to the question 
“Can I be enrolled to vote if I haven’t completed and enrolment form?”. It appears that Gemini 
now declines to respond this prompt, instead providing the scripted answer in relation to not 
being able to help with elections. I’m not sure if this is based on action you have taken in the 
background, if so, thanks and noted! 

  For a gold star from us it would be great if Gemini provided a link to the AEC’s website when 

Australian users submit queries about elections, although there is some nuance to this given we 
have state electoral management bodies to consider too. We also understand these things are not 
always as easy as they sound. Happy to discuss at our next meeting if this is something you think 
could be pursued. 

Next meeting - December 2024 

  At our last meeting on 23 October, it was agreed it would be useful to set up a post US election 

meeting before we all break for Christmas. Available times in December include: 

o  Monday, 16 December                   9.30am to 11.00am 
o  Monday, 16 December                   1pm to 2pm 

3

s47Fs47Fs47Fs47F 
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
o  Tuesday, 17 December                   1pm to 2pm 
o  Wednesday, 18 December            9.30am to 10.30am 
o  Wednesday, 18 December            1pm to 2pm 
o  Friday, 20 December                       9.30am to 12pm 
o  Friday, 20 December                       1pm to 2pm 

No problem if this is not a good week in the lead up to Christmas, just give me a steer on a better 
week and I’ll consult calendars accordingly. 

  We will send out an agenda prior the next meeting but note the following from our last meeting. 

o 

o 

 offered to brief on Google’s approach to AI in elections after gaining insight from 

the US presidential election on 5 November 

 offered to provide more information about how content provenance works on 

content uploaded to YouTube at next meeting 

o  Google and YouTube to provide information and insights into Sovereign Citizen promotion 

of misinformation/disinformation respective platforms 

o  Google and YouTube support for the next Australian federal election 
o  AEC to share trends in the election information environment with Google and YouTube 

Lastly, no doubt you are already aware of the Electoral Legislation Amendment (Electoral Reform) Bill 
2024 currently being considered. In case you are not already aware, there is a proposed amendment to 
section 348 (Control of behaviour at polling booths etc.) of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 that 
provides: 

(1A) A person commits an offence if:  

(a)          the person makes an audio or video recording in premises to which this section 
applies; and 

(b)          the recording is made without the permission of the person in charge of the 
premises; and  

(c)           the making of the recording constitutes a contravention of paragraph 348(1)(a); 
and  

(d)          the person:  

(i)            publishes the whole or a part of the recording; or  

(ii)           causes to be published the whole or a part of the recording.  

Penalty: 5 penalty units. 

4

s47Fs47F  
  
  
  
  
Essentially, it will be an offence to get your phone out and video or audio record in a polling place or 
counting centre and post it online without the permission of the officer in charge. Some of the content 
posted online that the AEC was concerned about during past events would be covered by this if/when it 
enacted. Flagging now ahead of our next meeting for discussion. 

Apologies for the lengthy email. Please let me know if you would like to discuss or receive further 
information. 

Kind regards,

Hi 

, 

No worries at all, we understand how busy you and the team have been. Grateful for your help in coordinating the 
relevant team members and their availabilities. 

Are there any time zone considerations that we need to take into account? Unfortunately, not much availability in 
the last week of July, but we have 9-10am AEST as a possibility on either the 23rd or 24th of July.  

Let me know if either of those dates would work for you, as well as any team members you’d like to attend, and we 
can get a Teams calendar invite sent out to you.  

Many thanks,

I hope you’ve been well. The Australian Electoral Commission has appreciated the productive 
engagement we’ve had with Google in the past, and while the date for the next Australian federal 
election is yet to be determined by the government, we are keeping a close eye on developments in this 
‘year of elections’ around the world, particularly advancements in generative AI technology. 

With that in mind, we are very interested in meeting with representatives from Google’s AI team to 
learn more about the following:  

 Any observations and lessons learned from recent elections around the globe and how 
these experiences are shaping your work on generative AI; 

 How Google is responding to electoral integrity risks when it comes to generative AI 
products like Gemini, with a particular focus on how we can ensure the Australian public has 
access to timely and accurate information about the electoral process; 

 A brief overview of SynthID including how it identifies AI-generated content; 

 Discussing pathways for the Elecoral Integrity Assurance Taskforce (EIAT) and the AEC to flag 
potential issues with you in relation to Australian federal electoral events and AI products like 
Gemini, and whether this would differ from our existing pathway. 

Any assistance you can provide in directing us to the relevant teams to meet with would be much 
appreciated.

Good morning 

 and 

We hope this email finds you well! 

As you would be aware, the AEC is preparing for the next federal election (FE24/25); while the date is 
yet to be determined by government, it could be called at any time with the latest date for it to be held 
being in May 2025. We would therefore like to arrange a meeting with you (and/or appropriate 
representatives as you see fit) in preparation. 

Given you will likely be quite busy in the lead up to the US Presidential election on 5 November, we 
would like to propose a meeting this month. 

At this meeting we would be interested in covering: 

 an update from the AEC on Australia’s electoral integrity environment 

 an update from Google/YouTube about your observations and lessons learned from 
recent elections around the globe and how these experiences are shaping your work 

 how Google/YouTube are responding to electoral integrity risks, with a particular 
focus on how we can ensure the Australian public has access to timely and accurate 
information about the electoral process 

 confirming the options and/or escalation pathways for the EIAT and the AEC to flag 
potential issues with Google/YouTube in relation to Australian federal electoral 
events 

 discuss the (FE24/25) version of the Online Platform Scenarios, which, although 
similar to the Referendum scenarios, has had some updates 

Grateful if you could please advise which (if any) of the following dates would be suitable for a 
September meeting.  

We would be aiming for a one-hour window within the following times.

Hi 

 and 

I hope you are having a great start to your year!  

Unfortunately, we have to reschedule our Electoral Integrity Assurance Taskforce (EIAT) meeting, 
currently scheduled for the 21st of February at 1:00pm – 2:00pm AEDT.  

Are you both available to meet on 26th February at 1:00pm – 2:00pm AEDT instead? 

Thank you for your understanding and assistance. Looking forward to meeting.
