Dear 

As you may be aware, a federal by-election has been called for the division of Eden-
Monaro in New South Wales for Saturday 4 July 2020.  As with all federal electoral
events, the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) is concerned that information is
not published that breaches the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 or contains
disinformation that can mislead voters about the electoral process or their obligations
under the Electoral Act.

The AEC is aware of the steps Twitter has taken since the 2019 Federal Election to
ban political and electoral advertisements.  Given the changes that have occurred
since May 2019, it would be good to arrange a teleconference to speak with you in
the next week.

Can you please also confirm the AECâ€™s point of contact at Twitter, if the AEC identifies
any communications on your platform that breach the Electoral Act.   As with the
Federal Election, the urgency of any requests we make increases the closer we are to
polling day.

Yours sin
