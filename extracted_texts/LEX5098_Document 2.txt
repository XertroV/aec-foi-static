3.  Removal of deceased electors 

•  The AEC employs a robust process to remove deceased electors from the roll and 

prevent deceased persons from being added to the electoral roll. 

•  The AEC manages the removal of deceased electors from the roll by collecting and 
analysing information from a variety of sources, including advice from the elector’s 
family and data from state registrars (Births, Deaths and Marriages), and other 
electoral authorities. 

• 

In the 12 months ending 30 September 2023, the AEC removed 156,000 deceased 
persons from the electoral roll.
