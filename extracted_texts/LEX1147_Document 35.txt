Morning 

,  

Apologies for delayed response, has been a busy morning here.  

Meeting invite has been amended to include 

, should be in your respective inboxes now.  

We have not assigned specific timings to agenda items (and I have just realised my creative numbering system on 
the agenda!) however the bulk of the conversation tomorrow should be focussed on your background, and our last 
item on working together. The agenda is optimistic in expectations that we cover all items in the detail that would 
be required, so I anticipate we will use this time to also discover what each of us would like to look at in more 
detail, and then we can focus any subsequent conversations. Are you happy with that proposal? 

Please give me a call if you would like to chat.  

Cheers

Hi Julie,  

I hope you are well and having a good day.  

I just wanted to check in and confirm you received my last email? I sent it quite late in the evening.  

Looking forward to hearing from you and connecting tomorrow. 

Cheers,
