Guy - as discussed, the number of new enrolments for Indigenous not on the roll could be predicted to a fair extent by the proportion of Email/SMSs 
provided by State. Further analysis of this shows that the strong correlation is for people aged 18-39. 

The proportion of people aged 18-39 in NT, WA and SA who provided Email/SMS is low and so is their proportion of new enrolments. This analysis will be 
more direct when Mike provides me with the extract that includes Email and/or SMS sent to confirm two hypothesis: 

1. We are sending less Email/SMS to these states.
2. Additionally, enrolment response rates are also lower for these states than for the rest (higher level of disengagement).

Thanks Guy – this data is very interesting. 
I suspect we may have to do something additional/special with the BDM data to establish eligibility prior to being able to do any meaningful 
direct enrolment effort.

Mike is also rerunning the data against the deceased persons file and deleted records to remove those who are deceased and identify those who have been 
enrolled in the past. I’ll let you know the outcome when I get it.
