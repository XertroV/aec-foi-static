Good morning,

FAD
opposition to proposal
Sunday, 27 January 2019 12:19:55 PM

I'd like to formally oppose this party being registered. The Women's Party exists in many countries as
a Radical Feminist Party. This is being registered as a non-feminist party which will cause confusion
and garner false votes.

Kind regards,
