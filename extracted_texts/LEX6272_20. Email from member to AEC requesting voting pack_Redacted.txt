Good morning 

If a replacement ballot pack is required, it is necessary to call one of the 2 numbers below to request it.

The call will need to be made by yourself and you will be required to make a verbal declaration.

If you require further information, please reach out.

Kind Regards

Subject: Police Association Documents

Good evening,

I have recently changed address and have not received my voting documents for the forthcoming Police Association of
South Australia President election.

Could I trouble you to send out fresh documents to the new address that I have updated today.

Many thanks,
