Great, thanks.

Yes, we have a couple of large spaces that’ll be free to take a pick from. No problems with 8:15 –
unless I come back to you in the interim with different contact details, just call my mobile (see
signature block) from the foyer.

Cheers
Evan

Hi Evan,

Apologies for this, I have just firmed up another IV at PH for Wed 16th.

Would Tuesday 15th at 9.30 be a possibility for the interview please?

And I am very keen to grab the footage of previous elections asap. And file sharing is perfect.

It would be great to be able to illustrate in pictures how voting/counting/declaring has progressed
over time with new technology etc.

Many thanks

Hi 

Wednesday 16 Feb at 9:30 would work for us. The Commissioner’s office and the prior set up timing is
fine. We’re located at 10 Mort St in the city.

The AEC’s new command centre is in the building as well and would likely make for good overlay (we
can show you it when you’re here and see what you think). 

I’ll come back to you re the warehouse details. We also have a range of footage of previous elections -
voting, counting, declaring nominations etc - and we can send things to you via file sharing if you
want….

Cheers
Evan

Hi again Evan,

Our shooting schedule is starting to firm up now, and Peta will be in Canberra on Mon 14th , Tues 15th
and Wed 16th Feb. Is there any availability in the Commissioner diary for any of these days? during the
morning. 0930-1030?  We would need 90 mins to set-up prior, and 30mins to wrap. And then we
could reset to the Warehouse for 30 mins.

In terms of Interview  location is the Commissioners Office a possibility?

Many thanks

Hi Evan,

Thanks for the prompt response, and that is great news. Also love the suggestion to shoot within an
(semi) operational scenario.

In terms of the interview, it would be best to do in a controlled and quiet environment.

Can I give you a call to discuss tomorrow/Thursday? When is a good time? And would there be archive
of the count from 2019 and other previous elections?

Many thanks

Hi


--- Page 4 ---

Confirming that the Commissioner is happy to help with this. If it suits, a discussion could be done
within an AEC premises or two that is a touch operational – for example, we lease warehouses where
we organise and dispatch polling materials, train polling staff and conduct the count (this sort of
venue could help visualise the behind-the-scenes explainer of how we deliver the election and
provide some good overlay).

I am assuming a Canberra location but let me know if that’s not right and I’ll then advise options. Also,
let me know if there is a preferred date/time and I can see what works on our end.

Cheers
Evan

Hi 

Sounds like a very interesting and worthwhile pre-election endeavour, and the successful conduct of
the federal election by the AEC is certainly a part of that. We’ll chat to the Commissioner and come
back to you soon.

Cheers

Hi


--- Page 5 ---

Thanks for the chat just now.

I am producing The Campaign Matters 1 hour documentary special hosted by Peta Credlin to go out
to a national audience on the Foxtel/SkyNews/Flash platforms, in the lead up to coming election.

The program will be a behind-the-scenes look at federal elections, with specific reference to the
coming contest; and explain how federal elections work and the process behind elections.

With the help of ex-leaders, campaign directors, sitting Members, candidates and psephologists Peta
will take a comprehensive look at what makes a successful campaign. 

We are hoping Mr Rogers will agree to be interviewed as part of this project, and Peta is very happy to
discuss it further over the phone. 

Specific areas of interest to be discussed include Australia’s electoral architecture and the need for in-
person voting in what will be a ‘covid’ election.

In terms of timing, we would hope to film the interview ASAP, within the next 4 weeks.

Please advise next steps and if I can provide more information.

Many thanks in advance,
