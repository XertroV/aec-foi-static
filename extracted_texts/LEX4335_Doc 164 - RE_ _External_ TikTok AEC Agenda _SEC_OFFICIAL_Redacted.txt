I hope you’re well and I’m looking forward to our meeting next Thursday, 16 Feb. At this stage I’m expecting AEC 
representatives from our Media and Digital Engagement Team, Regulatory Law Team and those of us who work 
closely with the Electoral Integrity Assurance Taskforce. 

I’ve attached a proposed agenda for our meeting. We’re hoping to have a short update from TikTok and I’ve 
proposed a few topics we’d be interested in hearing about. Of course, very open to any additional points you may 
wish to raise or discussing this further. 

Once confirmed, I’ll update the calendar appointment with the agenda.  

Looking forward to working with you as we approach the proposed referendum.  

Kind regards,
