Falsely claiming that Australia’s 2010 Federal Election was won by a smaller margin than the number of 
alleged multiple votes 
Falsely claiming that dead people are enrolled to vote 
Falsely claiming that identification is not required to enrol to vote 
Falsely claiming that one specific party is engaged in widespread electoral fraud
