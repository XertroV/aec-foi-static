Hi 

Would there be any options for later times throughout the day next week ? Happy to make some suggestions if that 
helps…. 

Unfortunately next week mornings are pretty hectic with global calls across the teams but can try and move things 
around if there is no other options?

Hi 

Thanks for getting back to me so quickly- much appreciated. 

Sorry to be a nuisance, but Matt is now unavailable for that time slot, and I am unable to move things around. All 
the other times remain suitable though. Are there any others that suit?

Good morning 

We hope this email finds you well. 

As you would be aware, the AEC is preparing for the next federal election (FE24/25); while the date is yet to be 
determined by government, it could be called at any time with the latest date for it to be held being in May 2025. 
We would therefore like to arrange a meeting with you (and/or appropriate representatives as you see fit) in 
preparation. 

Given you will likely be quite busy in the lead up to the US Presidential election on 5 November, we would like to 
propose a meeting this month.

At this meeting we would be interested in covering: 

an update from the AEC on Australia’s electoral integrity environment 
an update from Meta about your observations and lessons learned from recent elections around the 

globe and how these experiences are shaping your work 

how Meta are responding to electoral integrity risks, with a particular focus on how we can ensure 
the Australian public has access to timely and accurate information about the electoral process 
confirming the options and/or escalation pathways for the EIAT and the AEC to flag potential issues 

with Meta in relation to Australian federal electoral events 

discuss the (FE24/25) version of the Online Platform Scenarios, which, although similar to the 

Referendum scenarios, has had some updates 

Grateful if you could please advise which (if any) of the following dates would be suitable for a September meeting.  

We would be aiming for a one-hour window within the following times. 

Tuesday, 17 September 8am to 9.30am 
Wednesday, 18 September 8am to 10am 
Thursday, 19 September 8am to 9.30am 
Friday, 20 September 8am to 9.30am

Re: REQUEST : Following up on 2024 action items [SEC=OFFICIAL]

CAUTION: This email originated from outside of the Australian Federal Government. Do not click links or

Hi 

Thank you for your note below and my apologies for the delayed response; just making sure that you have my 
correct email address here going forward. 

We are very pleased to provide below the following outstanding updates and information that we discussed in our 
most recent meetings: 

AAP Check the Facts Media Literacy campaign 

In the lead-up to the 2023 Australian Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Voice Referendum, we supported a new 
media literacy campaign in collaboration with the Australia Associated Press building on our “Check The Facts” 
campaign, which ran ahead of the 2022 Federal Election in October 2021 and early 2022. The campaign ran for 6 
weeks with a combined reach on Facebook and Instagram in Australia of over 10 million users, creating over 40 
million impressions. Further information on the campaign is available on p37 of our latest Transparency Report 
under the Australian Code of Practice on Disinformation and Misinformation. We also supported AAP to run a new 
campaign in H2 this year, focused on raising awareness of AI-generated content online. This campaign only recently 
concluded and we hope to be able to share the results with you in early 2025.  

Network disruption efforts to counter the Russian ‘Doppelganger’ group 

Please see a detailed case study outlining this work as well as our wider recent efforts to counter Coordinated 
Inauthentic Behaviour on p11 of our latest Transparency Report under the Australian Code of Practice on 
Disinformation and Misinformation, which we submitted through our industry association DIGI in May this year. 

Meta’s approach to labelling AI-Generated content and claims regarding the use of AI in political advertising on 
Meta’s platforms during the Indian election 

In April 2024, we announced changes to the way that Meta is handling manipulated media, based on feedback from 
the Oversight Board and our policy review process with public opinion surveys and expert consultations. This 
included adding “AI info” labels to a wider range of video, audio and image content when we detect industry 
standard AI image indicators or when people disclose that they’re uploading AI-generated content. Further details 
on this announcement may be viewed here. 

With respect to advertising, any user who wants to run ads on our services about elections or politics must go 
through the authorisation process required on our platforms and is responsible for complying with applicable laws. 
Whenever content on our services - including ads - violates our community standards or community guidelines, we 
remove it, regardless of whether or not it is AI-generated. In the case of the reports specifically raised during this 
year’s election in India, the authors immediately deleted the ads in question, so we are unable to share any further 
comment or insight regarding the claims that were made. Leading up to the Australian election, however, we will 
activate our cross-functional election integrity team to work closely with the AEC and monitor for any violations of 
our policies, including relating to mis and disinformation, hate speech and incitement to violence, in relation to the 
election process and debate.

s22s47Fs47Fs47Fs47Fs47F 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Finally, we thought it might also be useful to share with you a recap by our President of Global Affairs, Nick Clegg, 
outlining our efforts and observations across the 2024 global elections, including in the US, India, Indonesia and the 
EU and in relation to the impact of AI, as well as freedom of expression and combating foreign interference. 

We hope that the above information is useful, but please let us know if you have any follow-up questions. We did 
see the recent press reports that Commissioner Rogers’ term at the AEC has recently concluded. We wish him all the 
very best and are sure that his many achievements while in the role were well celebrated ahead of his departure. 
We look forward to the opportunity to meet with the new Commissioner once they are settled into the role in the 
new year.  

In the meantime, we wish you all the very best for a safe and happy holiday season and looking forward to working 
with the AEC in 2025 and collaborating closely ahead of the upcoming election. 

Kind regards

Hi 

, 

Just checking in with a gentle reminder about the below information we requested a couple of weeks back. 

You must have a lot on your plate given the bills relating to social media that went before parliament over the past 
couple of weeks! There is a bit to cover in the email, but if you can give me a rough guide as to when you might be 
able to respond it would be helpful when we are briefing our seniors. 

Let me know if you need any further info.

Good morning 

 ; Matthew Haigh ;

I hope this email finds you well and thank you for the time you have put aside to meet with us over the course of 
2024. 

I am following up on Meta’s action items from our 2024 meetings and correspondence as follows, with our Electoral 
Commissioner particularly interested in the action item from 30 May.  

7 May 2024 - meeting 

  The Commissioner asked for information about media literacy programs Meta had developed for Australia 

and overseas 

o 

 – undertook to provide Meta’s report from a digital media literacy campaign (which 

reportedly had high engagement) which had been run with AAP for the 2023 referendum 

30 May 2024 - meeting 

 

 undertook to provide more information about the use of AI in political advertising on Meta’s platforms 

during the Indian election 

o  Revealed: Meta approved political ads in India that incited violence | India | The Guardian 
o  The Commissioner would like more information about this including what Meta may have learned 
from this experience given Meta’s approach to Australian federal elections is based on lessons and 
understanding from international events. 

10 July 2024 - email 

  As attached, 

 undertook to get back to our Assistant Commissioner about Russian linked influence 

efforts in the UK. Matt has not yet received a reply. 

29 October 2024 - email 

  A follow up question was sent via email (attached) to help inform our Media and Digital Engagement team 
about approached to AI content labelling. We are yet to receive a response/acknowledgement for this one. 

Lastly, by way of update, we are working towards circulation of the online platform scenarios early in the new year 
which, based on your suggestion, we have further update with AI specific scenarios. We will send an calendar invite 
when we have finished workshopping with our EIAT colleagues. 

It’s been a busy year for all of us (for slightly different reasons!), but we’re keen to get some further insights and 
information about these items to help us prepare for the next federal election. 

Please let me know if you would prefer to discuss or would like further information or context.

Subject: Meta follow-up 

Dear Commissioner, 

Many thanks to you and your team for recently meeting to discuss the latest trends in election integrity 
work within the digital industry, including at Meta. 

As discussed, for each Australian election, we draw on the lessons from the most recent elections that we 
have worked on around the world, tailored with local context, partnership and understanding. As we have 
clarity on the timing of the next federal election, we look forward to establishing more regular 
engagements and scenario planning to ensure both of our teams are ready to liaise in relation to emerging 
issues. 

We appreciate that there has been a greater adoption of Generative AI tools in today's society and we look 
forward to working with the AEC and other stakeholders on the potential challenges that they may 
present. In case it is of interest, I’ve attached our submission to the Department of Industry’s Safe and 
Responsible AI consultation last year. At Meta, we have been working on AI for over a decade and “classic 
AI” is a key part of our content governance and security systems. Additionally, content that has been 
created or altered using AI is still subject to our content policies and fact checking initiative.  

That said, we recognise that new policies and approaches are needed as the use of GenAI becomes more 
widespread. Since we filed our submission late last year, we have made a number of announcements that 
may be of interest to you:

  Adjustments to manipulated media policy: in response to feedback from the Oversight Board, we announced changes 
to how we handle manipulated media. The Board recommended that we broaden the scope of our manipulated media 
policy, but stop removing manipulated media that do not otherwise violate our Community Standards. 
Labeling AI-generated Images: we have been working with industry to develop both visible markers and invisible labels 
and metadata on images generated by AI tools. 

 

  AI Ad Disclosure policy: we’ve introduced new disclosure requirements for advertisers using AI or digital methods in 

social, electoral, or political ads. 

As you may have seen, we are also one of the companies that signed up to the Tech Accord to Combat 
Deceptive Use of AI in 2024 Elections is a set of commitments to deploy technology countering harmful AI-
generated content meant to deceive voters. 

And in relation to media literacy campaigns and how we measure success, as we mentioned, ahead of the 
Voice  Referendum,  we partnered  with  Australian  Associated  Press  (AAP)  to  launch  a  new media  literacy 
campaign that shared tips and advice with people so that they could make informed decisions about what 
they read, trust and share. The campaign videos (examples here and here) were scripted and shot by AAP 
FactCheck journalists and aimed to generate awareness of tactics used to spread mis- and disinformation 
and by driving audiences to check the facts via the AAP Fact Check website. The campaign ran for six weeks 
with a combined reach on Facebook and Instagram in Australia of over 10 million users, creating over 40 
million impressions.  

The latest EU campaign that you mentioned is currently being finalised in partnership with the European 
Fact-Checking Standards Network and specifically aims to raise public awareness of how to spot AI-
generated and digitally altered content. The campaign is scheduled to launch ahead of the 2024 EU 
Parliament Elections next month and will comprise a number of infographics and an explainer video. We 
can share details of the campaign’s reach and engagement with you when this information becomes 
available.  

Finally, please let us know if it would be helpful for us to arrange a virtual briefing with our colleague 
director on our security policy team, for a more detailed briefing about security trends and issues we’re seeing globally.

Thank you for these dates and suggestions but unfortunately that week is difficult to accommodate as we have

 and I have travel commitments the first half 

Thanks so much,

Hi 

, 

I hope this email finds you well! I’m writing regarding recent ABC reporting relating to five Facebook pages said to 
have been linked to Russian foreign interference in the UK election. I understand these pages have since been taken 
down by Meta for inauthentic behaviour.  

While the material posted was not reported to have received a significant amount of authentic engagement, 
incidents like this present an opportunity for us to learn from real-life events around the world. In order for the AEC 
to consider how we can best prepare ourselves ahead of our next federal election, we are interested in 
understanding more about the following: 

- We understand that advanced persistent threat (APT) actors will adapt their tactics and change profiles. How is 
Meta dealing with this challenge? Is it anticipated that limitations in detection methods may mean similar material 
goes undetected in future? 
- When Meta was made aware of the existence of the pages? 
- What steps were involved between being made aware of the pages and their takedown, and how long this took? 
- Whether there were other pages linked to the same network that have also been uncovered and actioned since? 
- Whether the ads review process detected any paid ads from these pages? 
- Whether elections operations centres include team members who specialise in detecting coordinated inauthentic 
behaviour and counter covert influence operations ahead of electoral events? 
- If there is any further information linking these pages to Russia (beyond the pro-Russian messaging and that 
Nigeria is a known base of operations for Russian-linked influence efforts)? 

Having a more fulsome understanding of Meta’s approach to this type of scenario will be very helpful for us to know 
how best to respond in the event something similar occurs here during our next election. 

We’d be happy to discuss, if needed, and look forward to hearing from you. 

Regards 

Matt
