Dear AEC Electoral Integrity team 

Further to our discussion earlier this year on the referendum and the visit by the EIAT delega(cid:415)on to Redmon in a 
couple of weeks’ (cid:415)me, I hoped the AEC could assist with providing some informa(cid:415)on to assist in Microso(cid:332)’s eﬀorts 
to combat dis- and misinforma(cid:415)on on our services. 

In par(cid:415)cular, we hoped to have a list of common misinforma(cid:415)on narra(cid:415)ves the AEC is observing. This will enable us 
to put appropriate measures in place to support the integrity of the informa(cid:415)on ecosystem. 

I understand AEC plans to have a misinforma(cid:415)on register, as during the federal elec(cid:415)on, but in the mean(cid:415)me, I 
would welcome your advice on current trends, as well as your thoughts on how we can access and update this 
informa(cid:415)on as the campaign progresses throughout the year. 

Please feel free to give me a call if easier to discussion. 

With many thanks
