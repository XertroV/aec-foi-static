Hi Tim, Evan, and Andrew,

Thanks for the introduction Kara, great meeting you all yesterday,  
As mentioned in our meeting I'm happy to fly to Canberra to facilitate a Twitter media 
workshop to update you on Twitter's media solutions and showcase the best way to utilise the 
platform from a campaign perspective.  

Please let me know if this would be helpful and we can start looking at some available dates? 

Many Thanks, 
Emily
