ESTIMATES BRIEF - Hot Issue 
Additional Estimates – February 2019 

INDIGENOUS ENROLMENT RATE ESTIMATES 

Subject/Issue 

The Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) has prepared Indigenous enrolment 
rate estimates that show an overall increase on previous estimates. 

Key points 

 AEC Indigenous enrolment rate estimates, show an overall increase on

previous published data and shows that the Indigenous enrolment rate has
grown at a faster pace than that of the Roll as a whole.

 As at 30 June 2018 the AEC estimates that the national Indigenous enrolment

was 76.4 per cent.

 This new estimate based on more robust data reveals that the estimated

number of Indigenous Australians of voting age, who are enrolled continues
to rise.

 In the 12 months from 30 June 2017 to 30 June 2018 the AEC estimates there

has been:

o a 5.1 per cent increase in the estimated number of enrolled Indigenous
Australians as a proportion of the estimated Indigenous population,
rising from 364,631 to 383,078; and

o a corresponding 4 per cent fall in the estimated number of non-enrolled

Indigenous Australians from 123,517 to 118,581.

 In the same 12 month period the estimated Indigenous voting age population
only increased by 2.8 per cent (13,511 electors) from 488,148 to 501,659.

 Any gap between non-Indigenous and Indigenous enrolment rates is

disappointing, however it is encouraging to see that Indigenous enrolment
rates have improved considerably since the last time estimates were prepared.

 This new estimates will further inform the strategies that the AEC is

delivering to further increase electoral participation by Aboriginal and Torres
Strait Islander people.

Background  

Indigenous enrolment rate estimates 
  Previous Indigenous enrolment rate estimates of 58 per cent were based on the best 

information we had at the time. 

  These new figures are based on more recent and accurate data. Specifically, the AEC has 

been provided with self-identified Indigeneity data by the Department of Human Services, 
and with population data by the Australian Bureau of Statistics. 

  The AEC will be using this improved methodology from here on, and we’ll be updating 

the data every year as part of our annual roll-integrity review. 
 
Indigenous enrolment rate has grown at a faster pace than that of the Roll as a whole. 
  The table below shows the estimated Indigenous enrolment rates at 30 June 2017 and 

30 June 2018 by state and territory. A comparison column shows the rate of improvement 
across all states/territories and nationally.
