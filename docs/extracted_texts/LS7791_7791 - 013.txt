To whom it may concern.
I am formally opposing the registration of the Political Organisation ‘The Women’s Party’ to a biological male. 
This title is used by radical feminists worldwide and it is misleading and offensive for this title to be registered
to anyone but a biological female with female centred politics.
Sincerely
