Mr Pope gave an update on AEC Operations. Key Points: 

Close of the Rolls 

-  Close of the rolls occurred at 8:00pm on Monday, 18 April 2022. 

- 

- 

- 

- 

At the time of the meeting, there had been 714,000 electronic enrolment 
transactions between the Announcement and the Close of Rolls.  

There has been an increase of 1.1 million people on the roll since the 2019 
federal election. There are 17.2 million people enrolled, which is just under 97% 
of the eligible population.  

At the time of the meeting, there had been 590,000 electronic postal vote 
applications received since announcement, compared to 290,000 at this point 
in the 2019 Federal Election, demonstrating a substantial increase.  

An increase in postal voting of up to three times the 2019 amount was 
projected and is within AEC tolerance. Counting may take longer due to the 
additional processing required for postal votes.

Returned postal votes were accepted up until Friday, 3 June 2022.

were returned to the AEC. Historically this is a very high return rate.  

  The data on the amount of postal vote applications received after the final date

Count of the House of Representatives votes is progressing well:  

  Approximately 12.1 million “ordinary” votes have been counted.

DESCRIPTION 

Regarding the Senate count:  

  The count of Senate ballots is roughly two-thirds completed, with smaller Territory 

counts closer to completion compared to the larger State counts.  

  Batch, dispatch, and receipt of Senate ballot papers from Outposted centres to 

Central Senate Scrutiny (CSS) locations continues. 

All count processes are on track to complete in time for the Return of the Writs.  

Turnout  

  Current projections are that turnout will be lower than previous federal elections, 
consistent with trends internationally following COVID-19. 2022 projected turnout 
is trending two to three per cent lower than 2019. 

o  2016 Federal Election turnout: 91.01% 

o  2019 Federal Election turnout: 91.9% 

Declarations of the Poll  

  By end of today (7 June 2022), 14 out of 151 House of Representative seats will 

have been declared.  

  By the end of the week, the AEC expects that roughly half of the House seats will 

be declared.  

Close Seats  

There are two remaining close seats: 

  Deakin (Vic) with a current margin of 440 votes, and  
  Gilmore (NSW) with a current margin of 348 votes.
