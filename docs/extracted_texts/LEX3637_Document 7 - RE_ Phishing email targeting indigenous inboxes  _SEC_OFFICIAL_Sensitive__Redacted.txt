Of note, this article, outlines that IPFS content is difficult to take down:  

“To be sure to have this fraudulent content taken down, it takes more effort than usual for cyberdefenders. They 
need to reach all the gateways that lead to the file and ask for removal of the content from their cache.”

Hi Andrew and 

 from the Victorian State Office notified us yesterday evening at 6.19pm about a suspicious email. 

After initial investigations (starting at 8.15am this morning) this appears to be a phishing campaign sent to 8 
Indigenous AEC email accounts: 

 
 
 

indigenous@aec.gov.au 
indigenous-sa@aec.gov.au 
indigenous-wa@aec.gov.au
