ELT Townhall 2023 - Transcript 

0:12 
Well, hi everyone. Uh, I'm Tom Rogers. For those that haven't met me, and I know we've got a number 
of new staff and I'm the electoral commissioner. Let me welcome you to this Town Hall and to start 
that I'd like to 

0:25 
begin by acknowledging the traditional custodians of the country throughout Australia and pay my 
respects to the elders past and present. So welcome. 

0:35 
These town halls have proven to be very popular. It's a great way of us being able to give you an 
agency wide update of what's occurring, but also importantly to give you the opportunity to ask any 
questions that you might have of any of the executive 

0:48 
for those that have been on these town halls before, you'll know the format. Each of us, each member 
of the executive is going to talk for a bit about what we're doing or issues that we think you might be 
interested in. 

1:01 
And at the same time, we'll have time for questions. So just to remind people, you can ask questions 
in a couple of different ways. You can wait till the end of everyone talking or if you've got a question 
on the way through, please ask it in the chat function, in the Q&A function. We'll do everything we 
possibly can to answer those questions. We've got a good track record of answering all of those 
questions. If we can't just because of time or it's too long, we'll take it on notice and come back to 
you. We'll either respond 

1:31 
and writing or I'll get one of the executive team to jump on and actually answer the question 
personally where we can. So again, thank you for that.

Uh, the Robo debt. 

53:26 
Um question. I think Jeff's answered really well. I I agree. If you've got a concern and you don't wanna 
talk to the AC, anyone in the AC please go to the APC. You've got a number of options open to you. 

53:38 
Great thing is I've certainly never seen anything like that, any systemic large scale events such as that 
internally in the AC and I don't think you're in fact I'd even go back before I arrived even in our history
