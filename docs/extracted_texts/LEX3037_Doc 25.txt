Hi team,

Iâ€™ve just lodged a webform (reference: CVL44I3JUPLFJ2RU3CHY3WQNRA) about 
, which has
been flagged with the AEC by social media users. Both the host and the guest repeatedly make misleading
claims that the Australian federal election was compromised by fraud throughout the first 20 minutes of the
video. Additionally, the video makes similar claims about the 2020 US Presidential election at timestamp
19:20.

Thanks and kind regards,
