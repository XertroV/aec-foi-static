Good afternoon 

If the membership list falls short of the required 500 members following the manual checks conducted by the AEC 
then the Party would be expected to be a notice under s 131 of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 (the Electoral 
Act) indicating that provides the Party an opportunity to rectify any issues with the application (such as not being 
assured the Party has at least 500 members who are electors). Further details regarding s 131 notices is on page 18 
of the Party Registration Guide. As previously advised, the Party would be provided details of the membership 
testing outcome but would not be provided details relating to specific members. 

Please advise if the Party still intends to submit a fresh membership list or would like the AEC to proceed with the 
list submitted as part of the Party’s application.

Morning 

Thanks for your email, can you please confirm the following; 

If the membership list falls short of the required 500 members following your check are we notified of which 
members don’t meet your requirements? ( you mentioned privacy issues however these people are our members 
and have already supplied their personal details) 

Because we have more members then what’s been supplied to you are we able to make up any short fall with 
members not on that list, i.e. if the list is 30 short due to the reasons you listed are we able to supply an addition 30 
then to make up the required 500?  

Can you confirm the re application process in the event of a membership shortfall.

Good morning 

Unfortunately the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) cannot provide a list of the members who were identified 
by AEC systems on the Party’s list as being on the Commonwealth Electoral Roll (or not auto-matched to the 
Commonwealth Electoral Roll) for privacy reasons. 

Please let me know if the Party still intends to review its membership list or would like the AEC to undertake 
individual checks against the Commonwealth Electoral Roll. After undertaking an individual manual check of the 
Commonwealth Electoral Roll the AEC will assess if these members will fall into one of four categories:  

• Matched to the Commonwealth Electoral Roll;
• Deceased;
• Not currently enrolled to vote; or
• Not found on the roll.

As previously advised the Party will require a minimum of 500 members from the list of 549 to be identified as being 
on the Commonwealth Electoral Roll for further membership testing to continue.

Good Afternoon 

Thank you for your call today in relation to our membership list. Can you provide me with the list that has been 
confirmed on the role as opposed to ones who aren’t? 

Interesting I just did a check on myself & it didn’t come up & I am definitely registered at my home address? Once 
we have the members in question we will start the process of contacting them ourselves.

Good afternoon 

As discussed, the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) has commenced testing the list of members provided by the 
Stop Selling Australia Party (the Party). Of the 549 entries on the list of people provided by the Party in support of its 
application 384 have been automatically matched to the Commonwealth Electoral Roll. Details for 167 of the entries 
of people provided by the Party in the current membership list require further manual checking by the AEC. For the 
AEC to undertake 165 manual checks on the current list will impact the expected time to process the Party’s 
application. It also indicates that some of the details for these members are deficient or erroneous as they have not 
been automatically matched to the Commonwealth Electoral Roll. Should the AEC not be assured that more than 
500 members are electors (currently on the Commonwealth Electoral Roll) results in a party failing the membership 
test.  

Can you please advise if you would like the AEC to continue to process the list submitted by the Party or if the Party 
will provide an alternate membership list as part of its application. The AEC will set aside the Party’s application until 
it receives an alternate membership list or is advised to continue testing the current list. 

The party can use the details in the membership list to check that each member is enrolled by using the check my 
electoral enrolment facility or eRoll which is available in all AEC offices. Party members used to support the 
application must be listed on the Commonwealth Electoral Roll. It can save a party several weeks in delays if the 
party does its own check of its members’ electoral enrolment online or at an AEC office.

Dear 

Thank you for providing the attached Appoint Party Agent Form. As discussed, for the Australian Electoral 
Commission (AEC) to process the Stop Selling Australia Party’s application, can you please provide the AEC: 

• An electronic list of between 500 and 550 members of the Party (the AEC notes the list provided 22 November

2018 contained 571 members), and 

• Written confirmation that you are being appointed as registered officer for the Party (as this field was missing

from the Application for Registration as a Non-Parliamentary Party form). 

If you have any queries please contact the AEC on 02 6271 4552 or email fad@aec.gov.au.
