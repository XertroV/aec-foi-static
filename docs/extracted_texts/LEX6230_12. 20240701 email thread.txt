Hello! 

Apols for the double up email here.  

Two things: 

1.  Appreciate there are some staff movements on your end – with that in mind, could you please confirm whom we should be addressing our invoices to? Please & thank you. 
2.  Please disregard the OOH & Print price quote that was included below – we have not yet formalised that estimate. My mistake. Updated finance tracker attached.  

Let us know if you have any Q’s.  

Thanks!

Hello! 

Just chiming in on this thread to provide the promised finance tracker.  

Please find this attached.  
To call out: below (also in the tracker) are the suggested payment terms for each PQ. Highlighted in yellow are those that we’d be looking to invoice next week.  

If you could please confirm you’re comfy with these payment terms that would be great. Everything is as per the contract terms so hopefully no issues – am conscious of EOFY though so 
shout if you have any concerns.
