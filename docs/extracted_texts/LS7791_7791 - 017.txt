Hi,

FAD
The Womanâ€™s Party - formal opposing
Sunday, 27 January 2019 9:25:14 AM

I'd like to formally oppose this party being registered. The Women's Party exists in many
countries as a Radical Feminist Party. This is being registered as a non-feminist party which
will cause confusion and garner false votes.

Kind Regards
