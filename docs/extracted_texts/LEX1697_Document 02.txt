Hi

I hope you’re well. Julie tells me you caught up yesterday and that she mentioned the online media content scenarios that the Taskforce has created. I have attached a copy of the template for you – it would be great if you are able to take a look and provide any feedback.

More than happy to set up a meeting to talk through it in more detail or answer any questions you may have – please let us know if you would like to do so.

Thank you!

Afternoon 

Thanks for bringing this forward.

Australian Electoral Commission

We will be watching Canadian election with great interest as we are aware of their model and they are quite mature in a lot of electoral integrity measures.

The AEC, in partnership with other electoral management bodies, are currently working on an Online Media – Elections Protocol,  which has similar purpose but is not necessarily a public statement. A version of the Protocol will soon be sent to DiGi for consultation (as an initial coordinated point). I’m not 100% on your membership or engagement with this group, but
should this progress we will be sure to include you in discussions.

Happy to chat further,
Julie

Hi Julie,

Hope you have been keeping well. Its very unfortunate Covid has gotten to Canberra.

Thought I would share this initiative TikTok (and other platforms) partnered with the Canadian Government on regarding electoral integrity - https://www.canada.ca/en/democratic-institutions/services/protecting-democracy/declaration-electoral-integrity.html

TikTok would most certainly be open to working with the AEC and EIAT on such a declaration here in Australia and we suspect the other major platforms would also be. If this is of interest to the AEC, do let me know and we will certainly do our part to make it happen.

Kind regards

Good afternoon Julie,

Please see attached for the draft PSA wording and a list of #hashtags that we propose to be covered on our platform. Content on our platform is tagged by #hashtags, so this means that whenever users search for these relevant hashtags in the Discover Page on TikTok, the PSA will appear at the top of the screen. 

[Example of the PSA]

I worked extensively with our Trust and Safety team to include all the possible hashtags that could be relevant, but both the PSA wording and hashtag list can be changed in the leadup to the election, to reflect the content on platform. 

Please mark any changes to the wording/list in the document attached and we will include them in a final copy of the PSA proposal to send through. Note there is some highlighted text for the AEC to fill in e.g. if you want the PSA to identify links to the AEC homepage or a specific 2022 page.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Kind regards,

Good morning Julie,

Fully appreciate the need for the AEC/EIAT to consider its options carefully!

We are glad to hear the AEC is interested in working with TikTok on an Election PSA. Our processes have slightly changed since the last time we did one with the NZ Government, so I will double-check the exact steps before sending them through to you. It is a fairly straightforward process which involves identifying relevant at-risk content (via #hashtags) and providing
information that can be placed on platform to direct people to official / reputable sources when they encounter the identified content. 

I also note your point regarding the AEC's limited capacity to run a verified account on TikTok this election period. If the AEC continues to be interested in this option in the future, we can certainly revisit that then and outline the support we can provide. Below I have copied the Singaporean Government's TikTok account which has been positively reported on for its
success in engaging young people. Its a great example of how serious public safety information can be communicated in an entertaining (and low cost production) format. 

https://www.tiktok.com/@gov.sg?lang=en (@gov.sg)

Lastly, I'll just clarify that the fact-checking partnership with the AFP is ongoing and informs our day-to-day moderation processes. It is part of our broader Trust and Safety efforts (which includes engagement with official bodies such as the AEC) to combat misinformation on TikTok.

I will follow up with you shortly regarding next steps for a PSA!

Kind regards

Hi

Coming back to you on the below email after some time to consume and consider.

While the fact checking partnership seems like a fabulous initiative in those circumstances, we won’t be able to invest into something similar. As per our initial discussions though we are incredibly appreciative of the cohesive working arrangements we’ll share moving forward for any content referrals. The AEC also acknowledges the effort
Tik Tok is investing into their platform to identify and address disinformation, particularly around Australian federal electoral processes.

We would like to take up the offer of an AEC PSA during the election period. Very keen to understand this further – i.e. - how, when, formats/constraints for content we’d need to provide etc. Really appreciative of this offer as it will be valuable to reach the Australian Tik Tok audience with an AEC message of this sort, at the appropriate time.

We’ve carefully considered the idea of creating an AEC Tik Tok account but decided against it at this stage. Our thought process is that if we are to go down this path we need to properly invest the time and effort into appropriate content for the channel and we’re not positioned to do that at this time. Perhaps the federal election after this
one.

Good morning Julie, Anastasia, and Taskforce members

Thank you again for taking the time to participate in yesterday's Transparency and Accountability Centre tour. I hope the tour provided some useful information about TikTok's recommendation system, content moderation and data security approach. 

Just following up on a couple of things that were raised.

1.    TikTok Australia entered into a partnership with Agence France-Presse (AFP) in 2020 to incorporate its expertise on fact-checking and combating misinformation. The article below provides some further detail on the AFP's reputation and how we are working together: 
https://www.afp.com/en/agency/press-releases-newsletter/afp-enters-partnership-tiktok-fact-checking-asia-pacific

1.    On-platform PSA and verified AEC account 

One thing that I forgot to mention is that we can offer the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) an on-platform Public Service Announcement (PSA) that will be seen by TikTok users when they search election related hashtags. The screenshot below provides a rough idea of how such a PSA could look.

Australian Electoral Commission

If desired, we are also able to help AEC activate and verify an official TikTok account. This would provide the AEC a presence on our platform and direct reach to our large and growing numbers of users. Below I have attached an example of content we worked in collaboration with the Australian eSafety Commission (and local TikTok creators) to produce for their
verified account on TikTok. 

Please let me know if you have any further questions or would like to follow-up on the above!

Kind regards

Hi Anastasia,

There is a weird limitation we have with our Teams accounts where we cant seem to directly invite people outside of TikTok to meetings (which is why I did not send an invite in my prior email). 

I am asking my IT team to have a look at this today but in the eventuallity that I cant fix it, are you able to send the link to the attendees (perhaps attach the copied Teams link in a discrete calendar invite)?

Hi Julie,

Yes, if you could provide referral emails in advance it does provide us extra certainty that we are responding to individuals/teams that have the appropriate authority. 

On the slidedeck, I will have to double check internally but I am sure we can get something to you this week. 

As discussed on Friday, we are happy to arrange follow-up meetings where needed. However I do propose we organise the Transparency and Accountability Centre Tour first (for the AEC
and Taskforce members together), as it is comprehensive and (from what I have seen) informative for regulators/government stakeholders. 

The tour also includes speakers that we would likely ask to sit-in on meetings to discuss issues that may be of interest to particular agencies so it is an efficent way for us to address any
questions from the various departments on the EIAT. 

From that point onnwards, we can work out what other meetings are needed and I can arrange everyone on my end. 

Let me know if that approach sounds appropriate to you. We are a small team so where we can answers questions upfront or consolidate meetings helps us a lot!

Kind regards

Other Taskforce agencies meeting regarding items in their broader Taskforce remit (TBC).

Good morning Julie,

Thank you for your time and organisation on Friday. I also extend that thanks to David and the other AEC and Taskforce attendees. 

Below I have summarised the last slide our Trust and Safety team were unable to speak to on Friday due to the video connection dropping out.

Agency Reporting and Support channels

As discussed, TikTok has a dedicated team managing election risks and responding to issues or concerning content in the lead-up to and on the day
of an election.

To enable timely responses to concerning content the AEC may wish for TikTok to review, we ask that any escalation/request be put in email
through to
The email should include a summary of the report/incident and the exact URL(s) of the relevant content. 

@tiktok.com. 

We would also ask that these emails either be sent from a team email alias or from individual(s) within AEC that you can identify as a liaison with
TikTok (e.g. social media manager/response team). 
This ensures we are addressing issues from the appropriate authority/personnel within TEC.

Please let me know if any of the above is unclear or if you have any more questions! 

Kind regards,
