ABS advice to AEC on sampling methodology 

Executive Summary 

The Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) has requested advice from the ABS to determine the 
number of ballots for assurance as part of the elections for the Australian Senate. The number of 
ballots that are manually checked for errors should be sufficient to demonstrate with a high level 
of confidence that the possible national error rate is low. 

The ABS recommends that Senate ballots should be assured at the following rate: 

•  1 in 3,000 ballots in New South Wales and Victoria; 
•  1 in 2,500 ballots in Queensland; 
•  1 in 1,250 ballots in Western Australia; 
•  1 in 1,000 ballots in South Australia; 
•  1 in 350 ballots in Tasmania; 
•  1 in 300 ballots in Australian Capital Territory; 
•  1 in 120 ballots in Northern Territory. 

Based on these rates, it is estimated that 9,895 ballots will be assured nationally for the 2021/22 
Senate election. A state breakdown is provided in Table 1: 

This assurance approach will provide a high level of confidence in confirming that the national 
error rate and error rates in each of the states and territories is low. 

In comparison with the internal AEC assurance approach implemented in 2019, the proposed 
allocation delivers a higher confidence in the national error rate, while requiring fewer ballots to 
be assured. The proposed approach also allows ballot assurance to be undertaken while 
processing. This is helpful to speed up the assurance. 

Background 

The Senate assurance process implements two stages of ballot testing. The first stage of testing 
checks that the scanned image matches the physical ballot paper. The second stage checks that 
the scanned image of the ballot paper matches the extracted data file, i.e. that the preferences 
from the scanned image match the datafile that is used to run the preference allocation process. 

An assurance of the 2019 Senate election found no errors during the first stage at ballot testing. 
The national estimate of the proportion of errors during the second stage of ballot testing is 
0.45%. The calculation of the national error rate is discussed here.

The emphasis of this report is to determine an appropriate allocation to assurance for stage 2 
errors. Given that no stage 1 errors were detected as part of the 2019 assurance from a sample 
of 1,368, it is evident that the true stage 1 error rate is very low. For the purposes of stage 1 
testing, it should be sufficient to assurance 1 in 10 of the ballots selected for stage 2 testing. The 
practical implementation is discussed here. 

Recommended Allocation 

This section details the recommended allocation and diagnostics associated with it 
Alternate allocations were considered and informed the final recommended allocation. See 
Appendix. 

The allocation utilised the following assumptions. 

•  While the 2019 assurance indicated that the prevalence of stage 2 errors differed by 
state, the difference between the state and national proportion of errors was not 
statistically significant, with the exception of the ACT, which had no errors detected.1 
Therefore, the calculated national stage 2 error rate of 0.45% was assumed in each 
state.  

•  An estimate of 16.095 million Senate forms nationally for the 2021/22 election. The 

distribution of form by state as provided by the AEC – see Table A1. 

The main criterion implemented for designing the target number of ballots to assurance by state 
was to have 99% confidence that the observed error rate in the sample for each state will be less 
than 1%, assuming that an error rate of 0.45% (as estimated in 2019) applies for the full 
population of senate votes. 

The minimum sample size to achieve this is to select 828 ballots in each state and territory – see 
Appendix for details. 

The recommended allocation places sample beyond this minimum value into each state. This is 
a conservative approach to ensure we have enough sample to meet the accuracy targets, and it 
produces round numbers for the sampling skips to be used, simplifying the implementation of this 
proposal.  It also helps to ensure robustness. The sample allocation will remain statistically valid 
if the actual number of Senate ballots in a particular state or the error rate differs slightly from 
what has been assumed.

1 The 2019 assurance found zero errors in ACT, during stage 2 testing.  Consequently, there is over 95% 
confidence that the true ACT stage 2 error rate is less than the national stage 2 error rate. The national second 
stage error rate is applied to ACT in the interests of simplicity and to ensure that ACT is not under-allocated.

Testing conclusions 

Based on the observed error rates from the 2019 assurance and the sample sizes in each state 
the following statistical statements could be made. 

• 

If there is a 0.45% error rate found in the assurance sample, then the AEC can be 95% 
confident that nationally, there are less than 6 errors per 1,000 ballot papers in the 
Senate scanning process.  It is also true that if the true error rate in the population is 
0.45%, then the AEC can be 95% confident that the error rate estimated from the 
assurance sample will be less than 6 errors per 1,000 ballot papers. 

•  Similarly, there is 99% confidence that nationally there are less than 6.5 errors per 1,000 

• 

ballot papers. 
In any given state, there is 99% confidence that there are less than 10 errors per 1,000 
ballot papers. 

These statistical statements are illustrative only. They are based on the assumption of a true 
error rate of 0.45% in the population to give confidence on the size of the estimated error rate 
from the sample; or similarly on the assumption of an error rate of 0.45% in the assurance 
sample to give confidence in what the error rate is for the full population.  Final confidence 
intervals will depend on the actual error rates found during the 2021/22 assurance. 

Comparison with 2019 assurance approach 

It is instructive to compare the proposed assurance approach with the assurance approach 
previously implemented in 2019. 

First, it is noted that the total expected number of ballots to assurance (9,895) is slightly lower 
than in 2019 (10,400).  

Secondly, rather than assuring a constant number of ballots in each state, the proposed 
allocation is assurances of more ballots in the more populous states and less ballots in the less 
populous states.  

Increasing the number of ballots assured in the more populous states allows the proposed 
allocation to deliver a higher confidence in the national error rate, while assuring a smaller 
number of ballots. 

Third, it is specified to assure at a constant rate in each state, rather than a fixed total number of 
ballots. This is efficient to allow ballots to be assured while processing is ongoing, rather than 
having to wait for all ballots to be processed before commencing assurance.

Practical implementation of assuring 

The AEC arranges senate ballots into bundles of 50. From a logistical perspective, it would be 
more efficient to first select a number of bundles and then select more than one ballot from each 
bundle. 

Furthermore, selecting bundles at a constant rate allows assurance to be undertaken while 
processing is ongoing – as it will not be necessary to have every bundle processed for assurance 
to commence. 

This is known as clustered sampling of the ballots.  Clustered samples can lead to lower 
accuracy if errors can also be clustered together, i.e. if errors are not evenly spread across all 
bundles.  We have suggested an approach that we believe balances the risk to accuracy from 
using a clustered sample with the benefits that it provides, i.e. reducing the number of bundles 
that need to be selected for the assurance sample.  The allocations provided in Table 1 have 
already allowed for some ‘slack’ by selecting more ballots than strictly necessary to obtain a 
precise national estimate of the stage 2 error. 

We propose the assurance selects a certain proportion of ‘bundles’ (e.g. 1 in every 300 bundles 
in NSW) and then to select 1/10 of all ballots in the bundle for stage 2 testing (so that overall 1 in 
every 3,000 ballots is selected in NSW). 

Once ballots have been selected for stage 2 testing, select 1 in every 10 of the stage 2 sample 
for stage 1 testing.  

If the sampling rate from Table 1 is adopted, then the process is described below in Table 2.

Calculating the national error rate 

If an assurance approach uses a different sampling rate in different states, then in order to 
calculate the national error rate, it is  important to weight the number of errors found in each state 
by the state’s proportion of the national population.

The error rate in each state is estimated by dividing the number of errors in each state by the 
assurance sample size.  For example, in NSW the assurance for 7 errors from a sample of 
1,300, giving an error rate of 0.54%.  An error rate of 0.54% would mean that there is a total of 
26,414 errors from the full population of 4,905,472 votes in NSW. 

After calculating the estimated number of total errors in each state they can be added to produce 
an estimate of total number of errors in Australia.  This total is 69,065 based on the 2019 
assurance results. 

Dividing the estimate of 69,065 errors by the total national votes of 15,184,085 gives the 
estimated national error rate of 0.45%. 

An alternate approach to calculate this national error rate is to multiply the error rate in each state 
by the proportion of votes in that state.  This gives:  
(0.323 x 0.0054) + (0.257 x 0.0046) + (0.198 x 0.0046) + (0.075 x 0.0038) +  
(0.099 x 0.0031) + (0.024 x 0.0046) + (0.007 x 0.0015) + (0.018 x 0)  
= 0.0045.

Alternate allocations 

This section outlines various allocation options that were considered, that informed the final 
recommended approach. These options are presented for technical background and can be 
skipped. 

The allocation described in Table 1 represents the ABS’ main recommendation.

--- Page 7 ---

Option A1: Allocation using a constant national sample rate 

The first option considered is to apply a constant assurance rate across each state nationally. 
This would differ from the assurance process from 2019, which assured a constant number of 
ballots (1,300) in each state as part of stage 2 testing.  

The advantages of applying a constant sample rate nationwide, is that it would allow the same 
assurance procedure to be applied in each state. Furthermore, the estimate of the national error 
rate would be easier to interpret as no weighting would be required. 

The disadvantage of applying a constant sample rate is that the smallest states would have 
relatively few ballots assured. This would result in a less confidence in the estimate of the state 
error rate. 

Sample allocations 

Table A3 shows the national level of accuracy associated with different sample sizes, while 
applying a constant sample rate nationally.

Scenario A represents the national sample size that was used for stage 2 testing as part of the 
2019 assurance. Scenario B represents the minimum national sample size to be 95% confident 
that the national error rate is less than 0.6%. 

From a practical perspective, it would make sense to use a larger sample size than this. 
Scenario C represents this, using a ‘round’ sample rate of 1 in 2,500 dwellings for each state.

It is evident that if precisely estimating the national error rate is the key objective, than the 
sample rate required can be significantly lower than what was applied in 2019 (Scenario A). 
It is also clear that this approach results in a relatively small number of ballots being sampled in 
Tasmania, Northern Territory and Australian Capital Territory. 

Option A2: Allocation with maximum state margin of error (MOE) constraint 

A notable disadvantage of applying a fixed sampling rate across all states is that the number of 
ballots assured in the smaller states is low. This will result in wide confidence intervals for the 
state level estimates of proportion of errors in smaller states/territories. 

The following two allocations examine the number of ballots required to be assured in each state 
in order to be 95% or 99% confident that the true state level error rate would be less than 1%

Glossary2 

Confidence Interval 

A confidence interval is an interval which has a known and controlled probability (generally 95% 
or 99%) to contain the true value. In the context of senate assurance, one-sided confidence limits 
are calculated for the stage 2 error rates, to determine the maximum error rate that could 
potentially occur, for the given level of confidence. 

Margin of Error (MoE) 

Margin of Error describes the distance from the population value that the assurance estimate is 
likely to be within, for a specified given level of confidence. For instance, at the 95% confidence 
level, the MoE indicates that there are about 19 chances in 20 that the estimate will differ from 
the population value (the figure obtained if all senate ballots had been assured) by less than the 
specified MoE. Equivalently it is one chance in 20 that the difference is greater than the specified 
MoE, i.e. outside the MoE. . 

Significance testing 

To determine whether a difference between two survey estimates is a real difference in the 
populations to which the estimates relate, or merely the product sampling variability, the 
statistical significance of the difference can be tested. The test is performed by calculating the 
standard error of the difference between two estimates and then dividing the actual difference by 
the standard error of the difference. If the result is greater than 1.96, there are 19 chances in 20 
that there is a real difference in the populations to which the estimates relate.  

Standard error 

The square root of the variance of the sampling distribution of a statistic (square root of variance 
of state or national error rate in the context of senate assurance) 

Variance 

The variance is the mean square deviation of the variable around the average value. It reflects 
the dispersion of the empirical values around its mean.
