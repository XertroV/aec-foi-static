Registration of The Women"s Party as a political party.
Tuesday, 22 January 2019 3:05:35 PM

Objection to the registration of The Women’s Party as a political party.
Under Section 137 Subsection2, or Section 134A or Section 138A of the Australian Electoral Act
1918.
The name Australian Women’s party seems to have been used previously in 1943, 1977 and
most recently in 1995 (lapsed 2003). According to my reading this title has been used by feminist
based parties working towards equality and women’s interests in general.
In my view and not having seen the manifesto of the proposed party, I contend that unless the
proposed party is not clearly focussed on the best interests of women, particularly equal ty, then
the title The Women’s Party would be false and misleading.
If that were the case, then registration should not be allowed.
