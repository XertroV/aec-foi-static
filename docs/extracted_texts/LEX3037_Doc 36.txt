Hello team,
We have been sent the following tiktok. This video records one of our staff members without their
awareness or consent in side of a counting centre. We would ask that this be removed as it breaks
privacy rules and identifies our staff.

Grateful if this can be swiftly addressed.

Cheers,
Bella
