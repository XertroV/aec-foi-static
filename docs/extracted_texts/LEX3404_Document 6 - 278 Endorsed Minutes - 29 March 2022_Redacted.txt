Agenda item 1: For Decision: Review of the delegate’s decision to deregister the 
‘Australian People’s Party’ 

The Commission examined and discussed the material before it in relation to the application 
for review brought by the ‘Australian People’s Party’ of the delegate’s decision of 
3 November 2021 to deregister the Australian People’s Party under s 137(6) of the 
Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 (Electoral Act). The application for review was made 
under s 141(2) of the Electoral Act. 

The Commission is satisfied on reasonable grounds that the Australian People’s Party is a 
non-Parliamentary party that does not have at least 1,500 members. The Commission 
therefore upholds the deregistration of the Australian People’s Party under s 137(6) of the 
Electoral Act and affirms the decision on review. 

The Commission decided:  

•  To affirm the delegate’s decision of 3 November 2021 pursuant to section 141(4) of 

the Electoral Act. 

Closing 

The Chairperson thanked members for attending and closed the meeting at 2:18pm.
