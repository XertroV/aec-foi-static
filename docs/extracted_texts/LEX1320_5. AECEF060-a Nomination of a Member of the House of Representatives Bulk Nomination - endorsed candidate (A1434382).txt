Information on this form is collected under the provisions of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918. 
The nomination form will be publicly produced at the time of the declaration of nominations, which takes place 24 hours after nominations close, and may be inspected at any 
time following the declaration of nominations by members of the public in accordance with the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918.
No responsibility will be taken for faxed nominations and no acknowledgement of receipt of faxes will be advised. The form may be sent by fax to the relevant Australian Electoral 
Officer (AEO). No other kind of electronic communication will be accepted. The time of receipt for faxed forms is the time when the message enters the relevant Australian 
Electoral Commission (AEC) fax machine memory and it is agreed that the AEC is not responsible for any deadlines missed or losses incurred. The deposit cannot be lodged 
electronically, and it is the responsibility of the candidate to ensure that both the fax and the required deposit are received by the AEO before the close of bulk nominations.
If a Registered Officer or a Deputy Registered Officer nominates a party’s endorsed candidates for the House of Representatives to the AEO, no nomination of any other 
candidates endorsed by that party should be made to a Divisional Returning Officer (DRO) within that State or Territory. If a nomination for another candidate endorsed by the 
same party is lodged with a DRO, all the party’s nominations made to the AEO under section 167(3) of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 will be rejected (section 172 CEA).
If your party has a logo entered in the Register of Political Parties at the time of nomination, you may request to have that logo printed adjacent to the candidate’s name on the 
ballot paper. 
For further information, please refer to the AEC website at www.aec.gov.au or call 13 23 26. 
Giving false or misleading information is a serious offence.
