Complaint Details

I never received any voting paperwork for our union election. i 
have been on leave and have, as a result of this error, been 
unable to participate in the voting.^

Expected Outcome

Surely this is a fundamental flaw in due process of the election 
where members are not receiving necessary information and 
documents to allow them to equally participate in the voting? I 
know I am not the only person who did not receive them. How can 
the result be considered legitimate where clear proceed issues 
have been known prior to the voting?^
