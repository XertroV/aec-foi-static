Good morning Julie, 

Thank you for your email. As you noted, 

is currently on a period of unavoidable leave (moving 

to BCC).   

We are keen to proceed with the initial meeting and our Senior Director of Public Policy for JAPAC and 
India, 

 (cc'd), will represent Twitter, alongside myself, Public Policy Associate for ANZ.  

Please let me know if you have any questions and I'll be happy to assist.  

All the best,

Hi 

,  

Thank you for the advice that you are now out of the office on Friday and unable to attend the scheduled meeting 
with the AEC and Electoral Integrity Assurance Taskforce.  

Would your preference for best way forward be to continue with an appropriate substitute staff member from 
Twitter, or to look at some alternative dates?  

Kind Regards 

Julie
