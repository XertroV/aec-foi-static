colleagues from our social media team.

Monday 6 February: anytime between 9am to 12pm, 2pm onwards.

If none of these dates suit, please let me know of alternatives and I’ll work on finding a suitable time.
We are happy to meet virtually on Microsoft Teams, but also more than happy to organise a meeting

Kind regards,
