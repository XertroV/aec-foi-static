6.  Due to the potential level of risk, Communications Section recommends removal of Tik Tok from 

all campaign phases and consideration as a potential paid media partner. While UM 
recommended its inclusion as a channel to reach young people, its use was recently banned on 
government-owned devices and there are ongoing brand safety concerns in Australia and 
overseas. The Department of Finance is reviewing the whole-of-government policy on Tik Tok 
advertising, but in the interim, it is worth noting this platform has not been used by any other 
department or agency for its campaigns.
