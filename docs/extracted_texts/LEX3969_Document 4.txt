Risks/Issues 

1. 

OFFICIAL 

7.  For all advertising under the CAS, UM has brand safety mechanisms to mitigate the risks of 
advertising appearing alongside inappropriate or political content. It is also worth highlighting 
recent media commentary around the use of Tik Tok by overseas governments. While Tik Tok is 
currently included in referendum media plans to reach younger audiences, Communications 
Section will continue to discuss brand safety requirements with the Department of Finance and 
UM to ensure this channel remains appropriate ahead of formalising media bookings.
