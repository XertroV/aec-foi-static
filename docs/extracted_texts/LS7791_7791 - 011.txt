Formal complaint re: "The Women"s Party"
Sunday, 27 January 2019 8:34:52 AM

To whom it may concern:

I write to you to formally oppose the registration of a new political party calling
themselves "The Women's Party". The name is misleading, as there are other political
parties in many countries called this, and it is well-known as a Radical Feminist Party.
This is being registered as a non-feminist party which will cause confusion and garner
false votes.

Please let's be sensible.

Kind Regards
