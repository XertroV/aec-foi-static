Drawing to your attention as the article contains the following:  The Bowman MP, who is on leave from parliament to undertake empathy counselling following complaints about his behaviour towards women, uses the sites to promote political material and attack his Labor opponents through pages classified with Facebook as “community” and “news” groups. None of the pages include political authorisation disclosures. According to the Australian Electoral Commission, political authorisation is required for “information that is a matter communicated, or intended to be communicated, for the dominant purpose of influencing the way electors vote in a federal election”. Evan is out today but my understanding is the AEC was not approached for comment prior to this article being published.  No action required at this stage, but I would expect this to trigger some complaints or enquiries.
