Greetings,

FAD
Oppose party registration.
Monday, 28 January 2019 9:05:56 AM

I'd like to formally oppose this party being registered. The Women's Party exists in many
countries as a Radical Feminist Party. This is being registered as a non-feminist party
which will cause confusion and garner false votes.

Kind Regards
