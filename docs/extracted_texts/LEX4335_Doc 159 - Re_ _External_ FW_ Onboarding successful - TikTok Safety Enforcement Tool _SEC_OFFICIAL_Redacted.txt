Hi 

Hoping you’re well and thank you for acknowledging receipt of our Regulatory Law teams letter
week.

Recently, we received confirmation that you’ve transitioned to TikTok's Safety Enforcement Tool (TSET). I’m looking 
to confirm if socialmedia@aec.gov.au, authorisations@aec.gov.au, and eiat@aec.gov.au are the AEC emails with 
access the tool?  

Happy to discuss if you have any questions or concerns.  

Kind regards,
