 [SEC=OFFICIAL] 

Hi team, 

Our social media team have last night identified 
reviewing it, weâ€™ve identified two issues: 

 from the 

TikTok account. After 

1)  7 April is not a deadline for enrolling to vote or updating your enrolment. The enrolment cutoff date has not 
yet been announced (it will be announced at the same time the election is called). This means the post could 
mislead about the deadline for enrolling to vote, potentially disenfranchising young voters.  

2)  The 

account is not authorised.  

Please let me know if we can provide any more information here. Happy to discuss further.  

Thanks and kind regards, 

Alex Morris | Digital and Social Media Manager
