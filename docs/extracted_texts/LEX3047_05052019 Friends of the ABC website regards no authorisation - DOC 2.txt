Complaint Details 

I draw your attention to the Friends of the ABC Queensland How-to-vote card which can be found 
at https://me.abcfriends.org.au/index.php/2019/04/25/queensland-how-to-vote-report-card-on-
parties/ This does not appear to contain an authorisation. The use of an Australian Government 
trademark (the ABC logo) has the potential to mislead voters as to the source of the electoral 
matter. 

Expected Outcome 

Request the Friends of the ABC to desist from circulating unauthorised material.
