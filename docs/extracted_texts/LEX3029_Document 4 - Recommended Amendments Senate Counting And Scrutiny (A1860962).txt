Abstract

This report summarises our recommendations for technical changes to those parts of the
Electoral Act that regulate the Senate Counting and Scrutiny. We show, and explain how
to correct, a point on which the AEC’s current counting software does not correspond to the
requirements of the legislation. As far as we know, this has so far not caused the wrong
people to be elected. We also identify ambiguities in the legislation, which might leave the
result undeﬁned. These would be better resolved before the election when they are politically
neutral.

Although the digitization process is separate from the counting stage, our results bolster the
argument for an independent audit of the paper ballots every Senate election, to demonstrate
to scrutineers that the ballot-digitization process is accurate, or to allow for any errors to be
identiﬁed and corrected.

1 Introduction

The Australian Senate count has several distinct phases:

• ﬁrst preferences are manually counted,

• paper ballots are imaged at a counting centre,

• the images are digitized, using a combined human and automated process,

• the digitized preferences are electronically counted, in order to establish who won a seat.

This report focuses on the last step. We ﬁnd an example in which the AEC’s oﬃcial counting
software deviates from the requirements of the Electoral Act, and two examples of changes of
interpretation. We then provide simple examples to demonstrate that these could, in principle,
alter election results, though it does not seem to have done so yet. We then detail where either
the code needs to be corrected to conform to the Electoral Act, or where the Electoral Act could
be amended to match what we know of the code.

The error concerns the resolution of 3-way ties for the candidate with the lowest tally. We ﬁnd
an example from the 2016 WA Senate election, in which the AEC’s software applied the wrong
tiebreaking rule, resulting in candidates being excluded in the wrong order. This is described in
Section 2.

The second issue is that the AEC has not implemented bulk exclusion (Section 13A). Contrary
to common belief (and probably contrary to the intentions of the authors of the Electoral Act),
bulk exclusion can alter who wins a seat. The Act is hard to interpret on whether bulk elimination
is compulsory. This is detailed in Section 3, together with examples to show why bulk exclusion
can alter the election outcome. We recommend that bulk exclusion be deleted from the Electoral
Act, matching the AEC’s current practice.

As a third issue, the Electoral Act does not clearly deﬁne when the count ends, which is relevant
because two termination conditions may apply simultaneously. This can leave ambiguity over who
wins the last seat (under subsection (17)) and can alter the order in which candidates are considered
to have been elected (under subsection 18). Suggested amendments are described in Section 4.

1.1 Prior work

These results are similar to our prior discoveries of errors in the NSW [CBNT17] and ACT [CT]
vote counts. The tiebreaking problems are similar to those identiﬁed by Wen [Wen10]. Most of
our suggestions for simpliﬁcations are aligned with Gor´e and Lebedeva [GL16], whose suggestions
for further improvements we also support.

Other open-source STV counting programs include Grahame Bowland’s Dividebatur1 and its
successor Dividebatur22, Lee Yingtong Li’s OpenTally3, and Milad Ghale’s formally veriﬁed STV4.
Dividebatur2 is speciﬁcally implemented for the exact Senate rules, and performs tiebreaking
correctly, but does not implement bulk exclusion.

We have written extensively in the past about the importance of auditing the digitization
process [BCT+19]. Although it is not directly relevant to this report, the importance of double-
checking electronic processes is emphasised, so we reiterate that recommendation here:

Recommendation 1. When the preference data ﬁles for Senate votes are published, there should
be a rigorous statistical audit to check that they accurately reﬂect the paper ballots. This should be
conducted in a way that allows Scrutineers to check both the algorithms and the data.

The rest of this report details speciﬁc issues in the count.

1.2 Summary and purpose of this report

We have identiﬁed one case in which the AEC’s software is diﬀerent from the legislated rules, one
in which it could be debated, and one in which the Electoral Act is ambiguous. These all need to
be clariﬁed before they make a diﬀerence to an election outcome.

The Senate count, like other Single Transferable Vote legislation, is highly complex and de-
pendent on a number of rather arbitrary choices. The ambiguity is the problem—almost any
clariﬁcation deﬁned in advance would suﬃce, as long as it was unambiguous and exactly followed
by the AEC. For example, if the AEC agreed to publish its source code, the legislation could be
amended to reﬂect it. (Although we would not generally recommend making legislation in this
way, it would be harmless for the examples in this report.)

Each section of this report includes speciﬁc recommendations for resolving the diﬀerences or

clarifying the rules.

Our aim in this report is to contribute to improving electoral legislation and process to achieve
election results that are unambiguous and publicly veriﬁable. Everyone makes mistakes, and there
is no reason that occasional errors should undermine public trust in the election, if there is a good
process for checking and correcting the count. Improving processes to produce clear evidence of
an accurate election outcome is of great beneﬁt for public trust in Australian election outcomes.

We encourage everyone to examine and double-check our results. Our code and examples are

2 Three way ties: error in the WA 2016 Senate count

When the lowest standing candidate is to be excluded, and there is a tie, there is an explicit rule
for resolving it:

Electoral Act, Section 273 31(b)

...if 2 or more continuing candidates have the same number of votes, those candidates
shall stand in the poll in the order of the relative number of votes of each of those
candidates at the last count at which each of them had a diﬀerent number of votes,
[our emphasis] with the continuing candidate with the greater or greatest number of
votes at that count standing higher in the poll and the continuing candidate with the
fewer or fewest number of votes at that count standing lower in the poll, but if there

Table 1: Tiebreaking in the ﬁrst 2016 WA Senate special election. Hercock was excluded, though
Fargher had the lowest tally when each of the three candidates’ tallies were diﬀerent (Count 4).

has been no such count the Australian Electoral Oﬃcer for the State shall determine
the order of standing of those candidates in the poll.

There are very similar clauses in subsections (22) and (22b) for order of election and surplus

distribution tie resolution.

In the ﬁrst WA 2016 Senate special count,5 (conducted on 7 March 2017, after Rod Cullerton
was removed), this situation arose at Count 48, where there was a three-way tie for exclusion:
M. Hercock, S. Fargher and H Heng all had 66 votes. Their tallies are shown in Table 1. The
last count at which each of them had a diﬀerent number of votes was Count 4, with 65, 61 and
63 respectively. Our reading of the legislation is that S. Fargher should therefore be excluded at
Count 48.

In the oﬃcial count, the AEC excluded M. Hercock instead. There is a natural argument for
this—at count 41 M. Hercock had a lower tally than either of the others, and there is no reason
other than the legislation that this would not be a reasonable basis for tie resolution. Indeed, this
approach has the advantage of resolving more situations than the “each of them had a diﬀerent
number” rule. It would be a reasonable thing to legislate, but it is not what the Electoral Act
currently requires.

Of course, diﬀerent methods of resolving who is excluded can easily change the outcome of the
election. As a very simple example of how this could aﬀect who is elected, imagine that the number
of vacancies was equal to the number of candidates remaining after the candidate in question was
excluded. For this reason it is essential that the legislation and the oﬃcial code be aligned.

Recommendation 2. Either:

• Correct the AEC’s oﬃcial code to follow the legislation for tie resolution, or

• Ask the AEC to publish the oﬃcial code, including its tiebreaking rules, and amend the

legislation to match it.

It is also worth pointing out that sometimes the prior counts do not resolve the tie, and the
Australian Electoral Oﬃcer is called upon to choose an order. In 2016 and 2019, it appears that all
such decisions favoured candidates according to their position on the ballot, with lower candidates
better favoured. This seems fair as the donkey vote otherwise favours higher candidates. This
seems like an excellent policy which we fully endorse, and would suggest making part of the act.

Recommendation 3. Formalize as legislation the apparent policy to, in the case of otherwise
unresolved ties, favour candidates lower on the ballot.

3 Bulk Exclusions: omission in the 2016 and 2019 counts

Section 273 subsection (13A) describes a bulk exclusion where multiple candidates are excluded
together. It is commonly believed (and probably intended) that this can never alter the election
outcome. In this section we show that that assumption is mistaken.

The AEC does not appear to have implemented bulk exclusions since 2013, presumably in the
mistaken belief that it cannot not alter the count. It is unclear whether bulk exclusion is at the
AEC’s discretion or not. The Electoral Act Section 273 (13) states:

5The oﬃcial Distribution of Preferences is at https://www.aec.gov.au/Elections/federal_elections/2016/

files/wa-senate-dist-prefs-2016fe-special-count-07032017.pdf

(13) Where, after the counting of ﬁrst preference votes or the transfer of surplus votes
(if any) of elected candidates, no candidate has, or fewer than the number of candidates
required to be elected have, received a number of votes equal to the quota:

(a) the candidate who stands lowest in the poll must be excluded; or

(b) if a bulk exclusion of candidates may be eﬀected under subsection (13A), those

candidates must be excluded;

The logic seems unclear here—we are not lawyers and cannot say with conﬁdence whether “those
candidates must be excluded” would apply whenever (13A) permits it, but that would be one
plausible interpretation.

In this section we provide two simple examples to show that, in two diﬀerent ways, bulk
exclusion can alter the outcome. The ﬁrst concerns the order of eliminations, the second is due to
rounding. In each case, diﬀerent people are elected depending on whether the bulk exclusion rule
is applied.

3.1 Bulk Exclusions and order of elimination

Subsection 13A (d) (i) does not have a clause requiring candidate C to satisfy a similar condition
to 13A (b) (ii). This means that bulk exclusions can change the order of elimination. This can
readily change the outcome of an election. A simple example is shown here with 6 vacancies, and
votes as described in the table below:

Preference List Occurrences
L1, L2, W1, W3

Using the rules as applied by the AEC in 2013, as best we can reverse engineer, would result

in the distribution of preferences shown in table 2, with bulk exclusion occurring on count 1:

However, using the rules that seem to have been applied by the AEC in 2016, ignoring bulk ex-
clusions, the order of elimination changes, and candidate W3 is elected instead of W2. Furthermore
the order of election of candidates W4, W5, W6 and W7 is reversed, as shown in table 3

Curiously enough, using the rules apparently applied by the AEC in 2019, the same candidates

are elected, but in a diﬀerent order; see section 4.2.

3.2 Bulk Exclusions and rounding

It is more obvious that Bulk Exclusions can change rounding, and this can change the result of
the election. Rounding may seem like a small eﬀect, but in 2016 Tasmania, there were 285 votes
lost due to rounding, and the margin between the last two candidates was 143 votes.

Here is a very simple demonstration of how the presence or absence of bulk exclusion can change

rounding and thus who is elected in a 2 vacancy election.

3.3 Bulk Exclusion summary and conclusion

These examples show that, as currently legislated, bulk exclusion can alter election outcomes,
though it has not done so in practice so far.

Bulk exclusion is an unnecessary complication for an electronic count. The ambiguity over
whether or not to use it could result in a contested election outcome that is diﬃcult or impossible
to resolve. The best way to avoid this is to remove bulk exclusion from the Act.

Recommendation 4. Remove Bulk Exclusion from the Act. This includes subsections (13A),
(13B), (13C), portions of (13AA), and several deﬁnitions in (29).

4 Ambiguity in the Act: termination of the count

There are three diﬀerent ways a candidate can be elected:

• by attaining a quota,

• by being the higher of the two continuing candidates when there is exactly one unﬁlled seat

(Subsection (17)).

• by being a continuing candidate when the number of unﬁlled seats equals the number of

continuing candidates, (subsection (18))

The Act does not explicitly deﬁne when the distribution of preferences ends—in particular, it
is unclear when subsections (17) or (18) apply. Subsection (18) aﬀects only order, not who gets
elected. However, subsection (17) can aﬀect who wins.

Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918, Section 273, (17)

In respect of the last vacancy for which two continuing candidates remain, the con-
tinuing candidate who has the larger number of votes shall be elected notwithstanding
that that number is below the quota, and if those candidates have an equal number of
votes the Australian Electoral Oﬃcer for the State shall have a casting vote but shall
not otherwise vote at the election.

Unlike a computer program, which (usually) has an implicit but well-deﬁned sequence of exe-
cution steps, the Electoral Act simply lists a number of things that could happen (in subsections
(9) through (18)) but does not specify which should be chosen when the conditions for two or more
have been met.

As a speciﬁc example, suppose one candidate (A) attains a quota (and hence a seat), leaving
two other candidates, B and C, competing for a single last seat. Should subsection (17) apply
immediately, electing whichever of B and C has a larger total, or should A’s surplus be distributed
ﬁrst? The legislation is not clear.

Subsection (14) states

(14) Any continuing candidate who has received a number of votes equal to or
greater than the quota on the completion of a transfer under subsection (13) or (15)
of ballot papers of an excluded candidate or candidates, as the case may be, shall be
elected, and, unless all the vacancies have been ﬁlled, the surplus votes (if any) of the
candidate so elected shall be transferred...

The question is whether, “all the vacancies have been ﬁlled,” because (17) applies immediately,
or instead (17) should not be applied until after this transfer has been completed. A similar
ambiguity arises over exclusions (subsection (15)): when a candidate is excluded, should subsection
(17) apply immediately, or should the excluded candidate’s preferences be distributed ﬁrst?

These decisions could aﬀect who wins, because preference distribution could alter the relative

rankings of the two continuing candidates.

4.1 Practical examples of when subsection (17) can alter the election

outcome

In practice, for all the examples we could ﬁnd, the AEC seems to apply (17) only after all transfers
have been completed. This seems like the right thing to do, and we believe the legislation should
be amended to reﬂect (what seems to be) the AEC’s practice. Indeed, subsection (17) could simply
be removed—it is unnecessary because the exclusion of the lower candidate immediately causes
subsection (18) to apply (one candidate and one seat remaining).

Resolving the ambiguity is important because this case arises frequently in practice. For exam-
ple, consider the special count of the 2016 South Australian Senate votes, conducted in 2017 after
the removal of Bob Day.6 The last steps are summarised in Table 6. At the end of Count 453, there
are three remaining candidates: McEwen (ALP), Gichuhi (FFP), and Burgess (ON). Burgess has
the least votes and is excluded, leaving only two candidates. If subsection (17) were applied imme-
diately, McEwen would win (with the higher tally). But after all the preferences are distributed,
Gichuhi wins. Similar examples arose in 2013 in NSW, Vic, WA and Tasmania.

Table 7: Elected : W1, W3, W7, W6, W5, W4. Rules used : AEC2019. Elected candidates are
colored purple once they have a quota.

Recommendation 5. Remove subsection (17), or clarify that it applies only after all papers from
surplus distributions and exclusions are transferred (which seems to be the AEC’s current practice).

4.2 Subsection 18

Subsection (18) does not aﬀect who wins, but may aﬀect their order—we do not know whether
this matters in any politically-relevant way.

In 2016, the AEC seemed to apply section 18 after ﬁnishing started exclusions and any surplus
distributions that may thereby arise. For example, in the Queensland 2016 election, at count 830,
candidate R. McGarvie was excluded, leaving 2 candidates and 2 seats. The exclusion was carried
out in full (11 counts), and C Ketter was discovered to have a quota, leaving 1 candidate (M
Roberts) and 1 vacancy. This candidate was not elected until count 841, when C Ketter’s surplus
was distributed. Similar events happened in Victoria (count 814), and NSW (count 1054). A
diﬀerent thing occurred in WA 2016 (with R. Cullerton excluded) where on count 535 K. Muir was
excluded, leaving 2 candidates and 2 seats. The ﬁrst step of the exclusion was performed, at the
end of which the remaining 2 candidates were both declared elected. Regardless, the transfer of
votes for the ﬁrst step of exclusion was always performed.

In 2019 the rules seemed to change and the AEC applied subsection (18) immediately after
identiﬁcation of a candidate to be excluded, before transferring any votes. In 2019 NSW, count
429, K. McCulloch is excluded. This leaves 2 candidates, 2 vacancies. The preference distribution
was aborted and no ballots were transferred in this count.

Recommendation 6. Clarify when subsection (18) applies.

The example used in Section 3.1 can be applied using the rules the AEC appeared to have used
in 2019, aborting an exclusion after identiﬁcation of the candidate to be excluded. This produces
yet another diﬀerent outcome from the same votes shown in table 7. This time only the order of
election changes, with the order of election of candidates W4, W5, W6 and W7 being reversed.

5 Conclusion

Everyone makes mistakes, and all software has bugs and security vulnerabilities.7 For election
software, the crucial thing is not to make the software perfect (which is impossible) but to ensure
an open and transparent process that allows the software, and its results, to be scrutinised and
double-checked. It is a good thing when errors and vulnerabilities are found and ﬁxed.

We have found one error (in the implementation of tiebreaking) in the AEC’s oﬃcial Senate
counting software. This needs to be corrected before the next election, and we would be happy to
help patch it if the source code is made openly available. Alternatively, the Electoral Act could be
amended to match the AEC’s current algorithm—it does not really matter how ties are broken,
as long as the algorithm is speciﬁed in advance. Modifying the Electoral Act to match the current
algorithm would also be aided by opening the source code.

The same applies to the other two ambiguities we identiﬁed in the Electoral Act: bulk exclusion
and the order of application of subsection (17). The legislation is unclear, and needs to be clariﬁed,
either to match the AEC’s current code (if it is made available) or independently. A system that
allows discretion over ambiguous rules, or runs a count diﬀerent from the speciﬁed rules, may result
in disputes at election time that are diﬃcult or impossible to resolve.

The purpose of this report is to avoid this outcome, by providing speciﬁc directions on correcting
the AEC’s code (Section 2), realigning the AEC’s code with the unclear legislation (Section 3),
and resolving ambiguitites in the legislation (Section 4). This should give very high conﬁdence
that the counting software is accurate and produces the unique outcome deﬁned by legislation.

It is easy to double-check the Senate counting software, because the software’s inputs (votes)
and outputs (distributions of preferences) are both publicly available. This allows for the open
public double-checking that is critical to democracy. (Of course it does not guarantee that all such
problems will be found before they aﬀect a count.) It is very helpful that the AEC makes this
information publicly available.

By contrast, it is not possible to double-check—so as to ﬁnd and ﬁx errors in—the software that
converts paper ballots to digitized preferences. This leaves the AEC without a way of providing
evidence of an accurate election outcome. A statistical audit of randomly-chosen paper ballots,
in the presence of scrutineers, would allow the digitized preferences to be double-checked against
their paper originals. This would give onlookers a chance to ﬁnd and ﬁx problems, or to see that
there was good evidence that the number of discrepancies was small.

6 Summary of Recommendations

Recommendation 1. When the preference data ﬁles for Senate votes are published, there should
be a rigorous statistical audit to check that they accurately reﬂect the paper ballots. This should be
conducted in a way that allows Scrutineers to check both the algorithms and the data.

Recommendation 2. Either:

• Correct the AEC’s oﬃcial code to follow the legislation for tie resolution, or

• Ask the AEC to publish the oﬃcial code, including its tiebreaking rules, and amend the

legislation to match it.

Recommendation 3. Formalize as legislation the apparent policy to, in the case of otherwise
unresolved ties, favour candidates lower on the ballot.

Recommendation 4. Remove Bulk Exclusion from the Act. This includes subsections (13A),
(13B), (13C), portions of (13AA), and several deﬁnitions in (29).

Recommendation 5. Remove subsection (17), or clarify that it applies only after all papers from
surplus distributions and exclusions are transferred (which seems to be the AEC’s current practice).

Recommendation 6. Clarify when subsection (18) applies.

7Even our software. We found the AEC tiebreaking error when we were re-implementing our version of the

Senate count and noticed we had made the same mistake.
