Hi 

Thanks for meeting and sharing some insight into TikTok’s referendum hub.  

I did think of a question while we were speaking that wasn’t entirely related to the discussion and am wondering if 
you can assist. TikTok Singapore recently advised that data requests be directed to them, see attached. You

 inbox will soon/ eventually not be monitored. Can you confirm 

Many thanks,
