Hi 

Re the warehouse, is it workable from a Sydney location (sending a Syd-based cameraman)? Our
facility in Syd Olympic Park is more advanced in readiness than the Queanbeyan site. Let me know
and, if so, we can tee up a time.

With remote voting, we’ll work on getting you raw footage. In the interim, you may also be able to
just scrape stuff from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcRpYkJZBEk or pan on high res stills from
https://www.flickr.com/photos/auselectoralcom/albums/72157710806573631.

I’ve also talked to the Commissioner re Peta’s interview and he’s happy if we setup in the AEC’s new
command centre for it. Anyway, there’ll be options to do that or an office backdrop when you get
here on the 14th.

Cheers
Evan

Hi 

Many thanks for sending these through. I will have a look and come back to you, and yes very
interested in the vision of the remote polling team, and the latest from Evan regarding access to the
AEC warehouse facility.

Regards,

Hi 

,

Evan asked me to send you a range of overlay footage of AEC activities / voting in action. There’s a bit
here but feel free to let us know if you’d like anything different and we’ll see what we can do.
The Interview time is locked in, which is great. We’re still looking into getting you into an AEC
warehouse facility and Evan will come back to you on this.

1.  Printing of postal vote applications, and general warehouse stuff:

We are also trying to source some shots of our remote polling team. We will forward them to you

Let me know if there is anything else I can do,

Thanks,
