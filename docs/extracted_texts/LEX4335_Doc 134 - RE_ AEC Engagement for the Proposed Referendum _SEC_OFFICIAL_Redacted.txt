Hi 

,  

I hope you’ve been well. Please find attached a proposed agenda for our meeting next Wednesday 15 February. 
We’re hoping to have a short update from Microsoft and I’ve proposed a few topics we’d be interested in hearing 
about. If, however, you feel any of these would be best covered as a standalone meeting or in a written brief then 
we’re of course happy to arrange. Also happy to receive advice on who from your team would be best to lead on the 
Microsoft update.  

I’ll include the agenda in our calendar appointment once confirmed.  
Very happy to discuss any questions you any have.  

Kind regards,  

 | Project Officer  

Defending Democracy Unit | Electoral Integrity and Communications Branch
