CHRISTOPHER DOREEditor-in-Chief1. Firms urge Covid minimum wage delayLow-paid workers in COVID-stressed industries could be hit by a second year of delayed minimum wage increases as the Fair Work Commission examines whether to again stagger pay rises for 2.2 million workers across the next financial year.Citing the winding up of the JobKeeper scheme and doubts over the vaccination rollout, employers in hard-hit sectors are urging the commission to either impose a 12-month minimum wage freeze or delay pay increases in industries adversely impacted by the COVID-19 economic shock by up to seven months.READ MORE: Pricing workers out of jobs would hold back recovery |  PM shelves vaccination targets | Recovery on track despite rollout delay  | Union calls for minimum wage for fruit pickers |  How Fair Work justifies $13 wage rise |  Wage rise ‘an assault on small business’Now that the vaccine rollout has been disrupted potentially, the most affected industries will continue to be the most affected and should not be forced to incur two wage increases within five months.WES LAMBERT, RESTAURANT AND CATERING2.

Prime Minister Scott Morrison says it is not possible to know whether every Australian will receive a vaccine shot before the end of the year, saying the federal government has no plans to set new targets. Keep up with the latest in our live blog.A further delay to the national vaccine rollout means most Australians will not enjoy a return to pre-COVID normality until early next year, but economists are confident the latest news around the AstraZeneca jab will not be enough to meaningfully “shift the dial” on the pace of the recovery.Another coronavirus case has been added to Queensland’s COVID-19 tally after it was revealed a woman who attended a party in Byron Bay last month tested positive.

Viewed through the prism of the woke, gender-fluid, cancelled culture of the 2020s, Prince Philip seems an anachronism: epitomising the rigidity of the British establishment of which he was at the heart, writes Anne Barrowclough. In fact it was Philip who dragged the monarchy out of the 19th century, who encouraged Britons to see themselves as innovators, who despised the stuffy elitism of the world he entered on his marriage to the young Princess Elizabeth.Even before the royal wedding in 1947 and in the early years of Elizabeth’s monarchy, the young naval officer was seen as the Princess Diana of his times; a modernising force, the man who would, some hoped and others dreaded, drive a musty establishment into the 20th century.IN OTHER NEWS:Too many Indigenous kids jailed: police chiefWar hero ‘buried proof of lewd conduct’Accused lawyer ‘invited to leave’Laming defies PM by seeking preselectionStrewth!: Turnbull tucks in for a busy week aheadWORLD: Charles delivers tribute to his ‘dear papa’Philip tired of ‘royalty nonsense’ at schoolVolcanic ash covers island then floats off to BarbadosBiden moves on Supreme ‘stack’4.

The Editorial: The principle that all employees are entitled to at least a minimum wage — the lowest amount they can be paid for their work — is an accepted part of workplace relations in Australia. Those workers, traditionally, all receive a pay rise at the same time. A second year of delaying pay rises for workers in sectors experiencing economic hardship could set a precedent, one that unions would oppose vehemently. But it would bring some flexibility to workplace relations and link wage rises to employers’ ability to pay, which would help struggling small businesses.Delve into Letters to the Editor here.6.
