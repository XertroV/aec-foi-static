Hi 

All good. 

At our last meeting, the AEC asked to preview the videos we would have on the TIkTok Voice Hub (where we also 
would like to include an AEC link/logo). 

These are the four videos that are intended to be included in the first iteration of the hub. Let me know if any of 
these would create potential issues for the AEC - we would of course share any plans to update these videos if the 
hub featured AEC branding.

Hi 

No worries. 

Yes, legal notices and data preservation requests should be submitted here:

Hope that clarifies things but let me know if you need more information.

Hi 

Thanks for meeting and sharing some insight into TikTok’s referendum hub.  

I did think of a question while we were speaking that wasn’t entirely related to the discussion and am wondering if 
you can assist. TikTok Singapore recently advised that data requests be directed to them, see attached. You 
previously mentioned the
the best address for issuing legal notices?  

 inbox will soon/ eventually not be monitored. Can you confirm 

Many thanks,
