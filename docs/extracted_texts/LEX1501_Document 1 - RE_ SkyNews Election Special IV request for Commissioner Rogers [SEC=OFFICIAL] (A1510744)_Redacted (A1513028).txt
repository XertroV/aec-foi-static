Tom, an interesting one for your consideration here. This sounds exactly like the sort of prominent
explainer piece we would want to do for that audience I think…We could even offer up meeting at
certain locations (OPC, command centre come to mind).

Hi

Sounds like a very interesting and worthwhile pre-election endeavour, and the successful conduct of
the federal election by the AEC is certainly a part of that. We’ll chat to the Commissioner and come
back to you soon.

Cheers
Evan

Hi 

Thanks for the chat just now.

I am producing The Campaign Matters 1 hour documentary special hosted by Peta Credlin to go out
to a national audience on the Foxtel/SkyNews/Flash platforms, in the lead up to coming election.

The program will be a behind-the-scenes look at federal elections, with specific reference to the
coming contest; and explain how federal elections work and the process behind elections.

With the help of ex-leaders, campaign directors, sitting Members, candidates and psephologists Peta
will take a comprehensive look at what makes a successful campaign. 

We are hoping Mr Rogers will agree to be interviewed as part of this project, and Peta is very happy
to discuss it further over the phone. 

Specific areas of interest to be discussed include Australia’s electoral architecture and the need for in-
person voting in what will be a ‘covid’ election.

In terms of timing, we would hope to film the interview ASAP, within the next 4 weeks.

Please advise next steps and if I can provide more information.

Many thanks in advance,

Producer – Sky News Documentaries
