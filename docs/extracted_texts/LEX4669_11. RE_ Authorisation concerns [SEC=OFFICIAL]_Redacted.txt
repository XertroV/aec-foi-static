Dear 
Thank you for acting in a timely manner regarding the authorisation requirements. We appreciate all
your efforts. We do note that the authorisation particulars you have provided for your Facebook posts
is for printed communications.
For ‘other communications’ that is NOT print material, such as a Facebook post, by a disclosure entity
that is not a natural person the following information must be included in the authorisation message:

(a) the name of the entity
(b) the relevant town or city of the entity;
(c) the name of the natural person responsible for giving
effect to the authorisation

Please find attached a flow chart to assist you to determine what communications you produce or
distribute will require authorisation as well what information must be included. Further guidance on
the authorisation requirements is also available on the AEC website, Authorising referendum
communication - Australian Electoral Commission (aec.gov.au).
It is a matter for Advance Australia if it wishes to amend the authorisation particulars, in this instance.
Kind regards,

Electoral Authorisation Team

As discussed, the AEC will extend the current authorisation compliance date to 5pm
Monday 7 August 2023. Please advise if you require more time to comply.
In relation to your question about the Referendum News Facebook page Ad Library
(facebook.com), if the communications are paid-for by a disclosure entity and the content
expressly promoting or/and opposing the law are referendum matter they require an
authorisation under section 110C(1)(a), (c) and (5) of the Referendum (Machinery
Provisions) Act 1984 (Referendum Act). The AEC considers the communications currently
on the Referendum New page include paid ads containing referendum matter that expressly
promoting or opposing the law. These communications therefore require authorisation.
Section 12 of the Commonwealth Electoral (Authorisation of Voter Communication)
Determination 2021 sets out the notifying particulars of the authorisation for communications
other than printed communications. Section 12(2)(d) states if the communication is
communicated in a form other than a form mentioned in paragraph (a), (b) or (c)—in one or
more of the following ways:

(i) at the end of the communication; or

(ii) on a webpage that can be accessed by a URL that is included, either in

whole or as a hyperlink, at the end of the communication;

If Advance Australia (via Referendum News) is unable to insert a URL/hyperlink into the
image of your paid advertisements, the AEC would accept the placement of an authorisation
in a paid advertisement at the end of the communication. For example:

If communicating about the proposed referendum, the AEC’s general guidance is – ‘when in
doubt, authorise it’.
If you are active in campaigning, receiving donations or making donations for a referendum,
you may have an obligation to disclose amounts received or spent on referendum matter.
More information is available on the AEC website at Referendum disclosure.
I trust that this information is of assistance. Please note that the above information is not to
be considered legal advice.
