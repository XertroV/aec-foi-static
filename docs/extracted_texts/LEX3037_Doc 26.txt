Hi 

Great timing as was looking to send something out today on statement of intent.

1 July is good for my and Evanâ€™s teams so will look to put something in. What timing options are
available from your side?

Kind regards
Julie

Hi Julie,

Hope you have been well and had a chance to rest since the election.

The TikTok Public Policy team will be in Canberra 1 July, and I was wondering whether it would be an 
opportune time for us to have a post-election catch up and potentially discuss the Statement of Intent 
and upcoming state elections. 

As you are aware we have been working closely with Evan's team and the EIIF as well, so we'd be 
happy to meet with everyone together but I thought I would reach out to you first.

Let me know your thoughts!
