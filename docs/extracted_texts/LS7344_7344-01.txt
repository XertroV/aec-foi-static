Hi Tim, Evan, and Andrew, 

Thank you again for coming by our offices yesterday to meet with myself and Emily. 

As discussed, we're looking forward to working with the AEC and appreciate your efforts in 
helping us ensure that we're developing detailed and efficient ways to handle any issues that 
might arise during future campaigns and elections.
