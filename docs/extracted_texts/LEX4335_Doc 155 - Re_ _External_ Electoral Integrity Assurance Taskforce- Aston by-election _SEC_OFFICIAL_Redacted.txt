Good afternoon 

I hope you’ve been well since we met last week. As you may have seen, the Speaker of the House of 
Representatives, Hon Milton Dick MP, will soon issue the writ for the election of a new Member of the House of 
Representatives for the electoral division of Aston in Victoria. 

Voting day will take place on Saturday 1 April 2023.  

The Electoral Integrity Assurance Taskforce will again be stood up to provide assurance to the Australian Electoral 
Commissioner, as well as the Australian public, of the integrity of this electoral event.  

Thank you for your time in our recent meetings concerning the proposed referendum. The Taskforce will use the 
referrals processes confirmed in these meetings and existing contact points for the by-election. 

If you have any questions regarding the EIAT’s involvement in this event, please don’t hesitate to contact us.  

Kind regards,
