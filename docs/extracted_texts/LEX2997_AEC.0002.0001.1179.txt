AEC.0002.0001.1180

Twitter activityThere is a reasonable level of Twitter activity on the matter off the back of tweets like the ones below. The general response in relation to the AEC – from members of the public - is a mixture of “don’t expect AEC to do anything”, “the AEC is biased so won’t take action” and “they don’t have any power to take action”.  As is standard on the channel – purple signs have been raised a number of times.  We will monitor Twitter traffic and provide some select responses – based on the below enquiry response.
