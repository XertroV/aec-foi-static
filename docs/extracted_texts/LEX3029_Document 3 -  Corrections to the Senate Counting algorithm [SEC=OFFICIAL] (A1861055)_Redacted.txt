Subject: Corrections to the Senate Counting algorithm

Dear Mr Rogers and Mr Ryan,

Please find attached our report on the AEC's Senate count.

We have found one instance in which the software breaks ties in a way that is not what is
specified in the Electoral Act. We have also noted some other ambiguities that need to be
resolved either by amending the Act or by otherwise committing to the exact counting
algorithm.

We would be very happy to help you correct the code - you can see our implementation here
https://github.com/AndrewConway/ConcreteSTV.  We could easily make the necessary
adjustments to the official code if it was similarly published online.

Also, we support recent proposals to audit randomly selected paper ballots at the end of the
digitizing process to give everyone evidence of the accuracy of the process. We would be
happy to help the AEC implement these measures securely and transparently.

Yours Sincerely,

Vanessa Teague and Andrew Conway.

Vanessa Teague

CEO, Thinking Cybersecurity Pty. Ltd.
