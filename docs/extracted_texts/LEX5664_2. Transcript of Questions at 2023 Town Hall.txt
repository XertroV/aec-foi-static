Some of us have been super concerned watching Robodebt. Could we have an 
reply from Moderator 
independent ethics adviser, not an AEC SES, so if we need to consult someone we can.

That is an interesting perspective. Firstly I would say what occurred in Robodebt is 
terrible and I have not seen any of that sort of behaviour, or anything close to it, in the 
AEC in my 10 years here. If you are looking for something independent I would suggest 
the Australian Public Service Commission but there are many ways to seek advise in the 
Question from anonymous user 
public service or to escalate concerns, including anonymously. Thanks, Jeff

Thanks for the comment. Following the findings of Robodebt the APS will be doing more 
work around this. You'll also see on the APSC website that there are a range of avenues 
open to raise concerns, including line managers harassment contact officers yees for 
dealing with concerns, central conduct or integrity units nominated individuals or 
teams in HR, including employee advice units or hotlines, or fraud prevention and 
control units or hotlines email reporting addresses ‘authorised officers’ who receive 
public interest disclosures.
