Deletions (duplicate, death, and eligible overseas electors) 

•  Removing electors from the roll to maintain accuracy and integrity is important to ensure the roll is 

always up to date. Deletions from the roll can occur for several reasons. Specifically, an 
enrolment can be deleted when: 

o  existing records are merged (if there are duplicate enrolment records) 
o  an elector has died 

•  Duplicate enrolment records occur when an elector’s name appears on the current electoral roll 
more than once. This can occur when a State Direct, Federal Direct, or ordinary enrolment 
application is processed without being matched to a current enrolment. The AEC investigates and 
corrects duplicate enrolments on a fortnightly basis.

•  The AEC receives death notifications from a variety of sources including the registrar of Births 

Deaths and Marriages, electoral events, state and territory electoral authorities, Public Trustees, 
and members of the public. 

•  The AEC processes death notifications from Births Deaths and Marriages monthly; and receives 
notification directly from relatives and interested parties. Notifications are matched to current and 
deleted enrolment records (e.g. where a person has been removed from the roll by objection). 
Once matched with a death notification, further investigation is required before re-enrolment can 
occur. This process is an important integrity measure that reduces impersonation opportunity.

High trust data sources as inputs 

Talking points 

•  The Electoral Act provides for the AEC to obtain and use data from other government agencies to 

assist in reviewing and maintaining the roll. These data sources include: 

o  Australian Bureau of Statistics 
o  Services Australia 
o  Australian Taxation Office 
o  National Exchange of Vehicle and Driver Information System (NEVDIS) (licence holders in 

each state and territory) 

o  Births, Deaths and Marriage registries (in each state and territory) 

o  Australia Post 

•  Data from these sources is used to support the following roll management activities: 

o  death deletions 

o 

identity verification

Death notification data 

•  The AEC employs a robust process to remove deceased electors from the roll and prevent 

deceased persons from being added to the electoral roll. 

•  The AEC manages the removal of deceased electors from the roll by collecting and analysing 
information from a variety of sources, including advice from the elector’s family and data from 
state registrars (Births, Deaths, and Marriages), and other electoral authorities. 

• 

In the 12 months ending 30 June 2023, the AEC removed 145,000 deceased persons from the 
electoral roll.

Human checks and system checks 

Talking points 

Human checks 

Monthly Roll Integrity Checks 

•  As part of the Roll Program, the AEC utilises system code to generate internal lists (from the 

current electoral roll data) that identifies elector records with similar and or exactly matching client 
details. The lists are distributed to trained operators across the country. In this, operators review 
records on the electoral roll for applications with: 

o  same Given Name/DOB/Address data 
o  identical Elector Names and Addresses data 
o  review of Electoral Twins data (‘Electoral Twins’ are different individuals with the same name 

and date of birth) 

o  other potential duplicates identified for transactions processed in the last month 
•  There are genuine instances in which two separate clients have matching details. The roll 
integrity checks identify genuine processing errors where a client’s existing record was not 
matched correctly. 

•  An amendment is a transaction used to correct any error made by the AEC during enrolment 

processing. An ‘error’ can take many forms including a data entry error or incorrectly matching an 
elector. 

•  A Federal Direct Enrolment Update (FDEU) transaction is corrected if the AEC has information 

that the transaction was wrongfully applied.

Questions 

Other remarks 

•  On any given day we estimate that more than 7,000 people on the roll either move house or die, 

thereby necessitating a change in their enrolment. 

o  These are identified through a range of mechanisms (self-initiated, death deletion, FDEU 

etc.) but this cannot be done on the day it occurs due to varying factors. 

o  The AEC processes on average 10,000 transactions each day to add and remove people 
from the roll or make changes to address and/or name and other details – the roll is highly 
current and accurate.

•  The final safety net of roll integrity for an electoral event is the Close of Rolls period. 

Applications are accepted up to 8pm (local time) on the seventh day after issue of the writ. 

•  During the Close of Rolls period, the focus of AEC advertising is for people to enrol or check their 

enrolment and update their details if necessary
