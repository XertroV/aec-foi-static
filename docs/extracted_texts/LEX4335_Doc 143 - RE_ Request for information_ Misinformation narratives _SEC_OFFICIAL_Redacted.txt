RE: Request for information:  Misinformation narratives [SEC=OFFICIAL]

Not a problem 

,  

While I have you, as you may be aware, the Speaker of the House of Representa(cid:415)ves recently announced that a by-
elec(cid:415)on for the federal electoral division of Fadden will be held on 15 July 2023. 
Vo(cid:415)ng day will take place on Saturday 15 July 2023.  

The Electoral Integrity Assurance Taskforce will again provide assurance to the Australian Electoral Commissioner, as 
well as the Australian public, of the integrity of this electoral event.  
If you could please advise if emailing all Microso(cid:332) and LinkedIn content referrals to 

 remains the most appropriate referral pathway for this event, that would be 

much appreciated.  

Should you have any ques(cid:415)ons regarding the EIAT’s involvement in this event, please don’t hesitate to let us know. 

Kind regards,

Good morning 

,  

Our Referendum Disinforma(cid:415)on Register is live on our website and is up to date with the predominant narra(cid:415)ves 
the AEC are currently observing concerning referendum process.  
The register will be updated regularly with predominant disinforma(cid:415)on and is likely to be the best source as we 
move closer to the referendum.  

Happy to discuss further if this isn’t the informa(cid:415)on you are looking for.  

Kind regards,

Dear AEC Electoral Integrity team 

Further to our discussion earlier this year on the referendum and the visit by the EIAT delega(cid:415)on to Redmon in a 
couple of weeks’ (cid:415)me, I hoped the AEC could assist with providing some informa(cid:415)on to assist in Microso(cid:332)’s eﬀorts 
to combat dis- and misinforma(cid:415)on on our services. 

In par(cid:415)cular, we hoped to have a list of common misinforma(cid:415)on narra(cid:415)ves the AEC is observing. This will enable us 
to put appropriate measures in place to support the integrity of the informa(cid:415)on ecosystem. 

I understand AEC plans to have a misinforma(cid:415)on register, as during the federal elec(cid:415)on, but in the mean(cid:415)me, I 
would welcome your advice on current trends, as well as your thoughts on how we can access and update this 
informa(cid:415)on as the campaign progresses throughout the year. 

Please feel free to give me a call if easier to discussion. 

With many thanks
