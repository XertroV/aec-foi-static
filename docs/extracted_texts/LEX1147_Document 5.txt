Hi Julie,

Would you be able to invite my following colleagues to the Teams meeting for Thursday:

, GM 

 - He will be attending in-person with 

and I.

 CISO 

, TnS

 TnS 

 TnS  

 (tbc she is likely to be unavailable)

I have tried forwarding your invite email but my colleagues cant see it/click yes (probably

because I am not the admin and your settings dont allow me to invite others).

Also, prior to the meeting would be able to double check that the Teams meeting has sharing

permissions on? That way myself and my colleagues can share to the room. As backup my

laptop does have a HDMI port and I can send through the slidedeck on the day if need be.

Kind regards
