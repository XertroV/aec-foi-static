Background 

Current state of the roll 

•  The enrolment rate is calculated on a monthly basis using federal enrolments and Estimated 
Eligible Population (EEP) primarily based on Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) data. The 
ABS information uses census-year populations by citizenship, updated for post-census 
interstate and overseas migration, deaths, and population ageing, then projected to the 
reference date and adjusted for new citizens, pre-1984 British Subjects, those who because of 
unsound mind are unable to understand the nature and significance of voting, and overseas 
electors.

2.  Removal of deceased electors 

•  The AEC employs a robust process to remove deceased electors from the roll and prevent 

deceased persons from being added to the electoral roll. 

•  The AEC manages the removal of deceased electors from the roll by collecting and 

analysing information from a variety of sources, including advice from the elector’s family 
and data from state registrars (Births, Deaths and Marriages), and other electoral 
authorities. 

• 

In the 12 months ending 31 July 2023, the AEC removed 153,000 deceased persons from 
the electoral roll.
