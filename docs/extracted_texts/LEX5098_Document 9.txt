Background 

Current state of the roll 

• The enrolment rate is calculated on a monthly basis using federal enrolments and Estimated
Eligible Population (EEP) primarily based on Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) data. The
ABS information uses census-year populations by citizenship, updated for post-census
interstate and overseas migration, deaths, and population ageing, then projected to the
reference date and adjusted for new citizens, pre-1984 British Subjects, those who because of
unsound mind are unable to understand the nature and significance of voting, and overseas
electors.

2. Removal of deceased electors

• The AEC employs a robust process to remove deceased electors from the roll and prevent

deceased persons from being added to the electoral roll.

• The AEC manages the removal of deceased electors from the roll by collecting and

analysing information from a variety of sources, including advice from the elector’s family
and data from state registrars (Births, Deaths and Marriages), and other electoral
authorities.

•

In the 12 months ending 31 March 2023, the AEC removed 147,700 deceased persons
from the electoral roll.
