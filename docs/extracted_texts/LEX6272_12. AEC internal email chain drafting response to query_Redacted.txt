Hi 

Monday, 24 June 2024 3:44 PM

RE: E2024/78- Branch President PASA query [SEC=OFFICIAL]

Here is a slightly revised response: 

Dear 

Thank you for your email sent on 24 June 2024 regarding the elec(cid:415)on E2024/78. 

It does not appear that s190 has been breached. 

s190 of the Fair Work (Registered Organisa(cid:415)ons) Act 2009 states: 

FAIR WORK (REGISTERED ORGANISATIONS) ACT 2009 - SECT 190 Organisa(cid:415)on or branch must not assist one 
candidate over another 

An organisa(cid:415)on or branch commits an oﬀence if it uses, or allows to be used, its property or resources to help a 
candidate against another candidate in an elec(cid:415)on under this Part for an oﬃce or other posi(cid:415)on. 
Penalty:  100 penalty units. 

The organisa(cid:415)ons rule book can be found on the Fair Work Commission website under the tab ‘Registered 
Organisa(cid:415)on’.

Hi 

Here is another dra(cid:332) le(cid:425)er related to PFA SA E2024/78 elec(cid:415)on. 

Please review the emails from the candidate and my response. 

Regards 

Dra(cid:332) email 

Dear 

Thank you for your query and email response. 

I understand that you are concerned about the email being sent by 
 to voters lobbying for 
another candidate in elec(cid:415)on No.E2024/78. It seems that the emails are not oﬃcial emails which was also conﬁrmed 
by you later. 
I do not believe that this ma(cid:425)er cons(cid:415)tutes a breach of s190 of the Fair Work (Registered Organisa(cid:415)ons) Act 2009 
that states: 

FAIR WORK (REGISTERED ORGANISATIONS) ACT 2009 - SECT 190 Organisa(cid:415)on or branch must not assist one 
candidate over another 
  An organisa(cid:415)on or branch commits an oﬀence if it uses, or allows to be used, its property or resources to help a 
candidate against another candidate in an elec(cid:415)on under this Part for an oﬃce or other posi(cid:415)on. 
Penalty:  100 penalty units. 

To get a detailed understanding pf the rules of your Organisa(cid:415)on, you may look for the copy of the rules in Fair Work 
Commission website under the tab ‘Registered Organisa(cid:415)on’.  

Thank you for bringing concerns to my a(cid:425)en(cid:415)on.   

Regards

No they are not oﬃcial emails.  They are created by the member on Gmail and outlook. 

But I’d argue that they appear to general members (who they were sent to - and lots of junior members) would 
reasonably think/consider they are from PASA.

They are board members and known as board members. 

Not many members know the oﬃcial PASA email addresses.
