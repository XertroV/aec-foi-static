Morning 

,  

Please see below for proposed agenda for our meeting on Friday. Please let me know if you 
would like any additions or amendments at this time.  

Looking at the length of the agenda and given you have committed to travel for this meeting, 
would you be open to extending the length to 1.5hrs? This should allow us to get into some more 
conversation up front. If required, we will then be able to follow up with some additional video 
conference time.  

Happy to discuss, 

Julie
