Commonwealth law
infringed/issues
Policy:

FI is likely to be a break of
platforms’ own terms of use

Operational:

Division 92, Part 5.2
Criminal Code Act 1995

Detection and attribution can
be time and resource
intensive, while
disinformation strategies are
cheap and agile.

Scenari
o
5

Description
Foreign
interference

This scenario
notes the
difference
between the
legislated and
policy definitions
of “foreign
interference”, and
the differing
approaches taken
by policy agencies
(CFICC), and
operational
agencies/bodies
(including the CFI
Taskforce).

Examples
Policy:

Social media accounts
that appear to:

● amplify, then

consistently promote
divisive political
positions designed to
fragment the
electorate,
● target specific

demographics within
the electorate with
messaging designed to
influence voting
behaviour.

Operational:

To be actionable under
s92, FI activity must meet
the elements specified in
s92, notably: 1. Conduct;
2. done on half
of/directed by a Foreign
Principal; 3. to achieve
one of the four stated
intentions; 4. done
covertly/deceptively/wit
h menace/etc

6

Electoral
communication
containing threats
of terrorist action

communication

advertisement)
without
authorisation

Commonwealth law
infringed/issues
Depends on who is
communicating the matter
as to whether the
communication must be
authorised under the
Commonwealth Electoral
Act 1918.  An electoral
communication must be
authorised if it is for, or on
behalf of, a disclosure entit
(i.e. a candidate, political
party or other person or
group that is required to
report electoral
expenditure or donations t
the Electoral Commission
under Part XX of the
Electoral Act).

8

Electoral
communication
(including a paid
electoral ad) that
is defamatory

paid advertisement that
defames a candidate so
as to affect public
perception of the
integrity of the
candidate, party, election
or political system.

Affected individual or
organisation can take legal
action, however, issue may
be to stop the spread of
disinformation during an
election campaign.
