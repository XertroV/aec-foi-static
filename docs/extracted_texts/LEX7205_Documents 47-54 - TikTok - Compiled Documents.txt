Dear Acting Commissioner,

Thank you for the Australian Electoral Commission's (AEC’s) ongoing engagement with TikTok
and for recently joining the platform to reach over 9.5 million Australian users.

We are protecting the integrity of our platform during the upcoming Australian Federal
election, including removing content that violates our strict Community Guidelines and
supporting civic and electoral integrity. As emphasised in our recent direct engagement with
the Australian Electoral Commission, including members of the Electoral Integrity Taskforce,
we continue to invest in our Trust & Safety function, maintain our fact-checking infrastructure,
including in Australia, and treat Federal elections with the seriousness they warrant, noting
many of the global concerns you raise.

As part of this ongoing work, in 2024 we updated our Civic and Election Integrity policies to
provide greater clarity around protections for election workers, or observers, who might face
intimidation or harassment in the course of these critical events. We also continue to refine
our AI-Generated Content (AIGC) policies to respond to emerging trends and threats. These
policies now require users to label AIGC content, using in-app features, and we also apply
auto-labelling ourselves. We recognise that even when appropriately labelled, AIGC and edited
media may still be harmful. We do not allow content that shares or shows fake authoritative
sources or crisis events, or falsely shows public figures in certain contexts including being
bullied, making an endorsement, or being endorsed. In these instances, we will remove the
violative content through proactive moderation, user reports, and reports as escalated by the
AEC.

Noting the global threat landscape, including around elections, in 2024 we also expanded our
state-affiliated media policies to further address state-affiliated media accounts that attempt
to reach communities outside their home country on current global events and affairs. When


--- Page 5 ---

we  identify  these  accounts,  they  will  become  ineligible  for  recommendation,  which  means 
their  content  won't  appear  in  the  For  You  feed  -  the  primary  way  TikTok  users  discover 
content. In addition, if these accounts advertise on our platform, they will not be allowed to 

advertise  outside  of  the  country  with  which  they  are  primarily  affiliated.  Importantly,  in 
relation to Covert Influence Operations, in 2024, we also introduced monthly public reporting, 
which we publish on our Transparency Centre.1 These reports disclose the detection source, 
the  target  location(s)  of  such  operations,  the  number  of  accounts  in  a  network,  and  the 
number of followers those accounts might have had. We leverage our global team's expertise 

and insights in relation to any potential threats in Australia and, where we detect these, we 
disclose them.  

For  the  upcoming  federal  election  in  Australia,  TikTok  has  established  a  dedicated  core 
working group to assess and respond to reports we receive from the AEC, ensure moderation 

systems  are  up-to-date,  and  adapt  to  unfolding  events  as  they  might  emerge  during  the 
electoral period (including content related trends, whether concerning AICG or other types of 
content).  

We have taken specific actions to support the safety and integrity of the 2025 Federal Election, 

including:  

1.  Upholding our prohibition on paid political advertising on-platform. This includes both 
traditional  paid  advertisements  and  creators  receiving  compensation  to  support  or 
oppose a candidate. 

2.  Maintaining an active TikTok reporting portal access for the AEC to report content of 

concern.  

3.  Providing re-direction, in-app, to authoritative election-related information for content 
concerning  the  federal  election,  including  linking  to  the  AEC's  website  and  TikTok 
account. 

4.  Conducting  impersonation  sweeps  for  accounts  that  are  verified  as  belonging  to 
Australian political candidates, including existing elected Members and Senators, with 
appropriate enforcement action taken as a result.  

5.  Issuing policy guidance specific to the election for our moderation system, including 

guidance that covers AIGC.  

6.  Establishing a pathway for communication with other government agencies, including 
as it concerns the safety of Members of Parliament, to enable a timely response to 
issues that may arise in the Australian community during the electoral period.

We are happy to clarify any of these matters via further discussion with the AEC, and we look

Good morning

Ahead of our mee(cid:415)ng today at 1pm , I just wanted to give you the heads up about a couple of ques(cid:415)ons the EIAT TF 
Chair, Ma(cid:425) Haigh, will ask you over the course of the update from the AEC/EIAT.  

  What are some of the posi(cid:415)ve ways TikTok has been used during an elec(cid:415)on? (For example, community 
educa(cid:415)on campaigns, encouraging people to enrol and to vote. We note some reputable sources such as 
the ABC have posted ‘How To Vote’ videos.) 

  Does the TikTok algorithm give priority to authorita(cid:415)ve sources of informa(cid:415)on about an elec(cid:415)on? For 

example, AEC, ABC and other authorita(cid:415)ve sources of informa(cid:415)on. 

  Does TikTok have any elec(cid:415)on speciﬁc ﬁlters (no(cid:415)ng Snap has something, but this may work diﬀerently on 

TikTok) 

  Have referral pathways changed since the 2023 referendum? 
  Have there been any changes to TikTok’s processes or referral pathways for legal referrals? 
  We’re aware that the use of AI to enable the spread of mis and disinforma(cid:415)on remains an existen(cid:415)al 
challenge for everyone in the online environment, including TikTok. Given reports of AI enabled 
misinforma(cid:415)on on TikTok (Network of TikTok accounts using AI to spread poli(cid:415)cal misinforma(cid:415)on, report 
ﬁnds | Mashable , TikTok Content Farms Use AI Voiceovers to Mass-Produce Poli(cid:415)cal Misinforma(cid:415)on - 
NewsGuard) during last year’s elec(cid:415)ons: 

o  What did TikTok learn from this and has this ben the catalyst for any changes? 
o  What guardrails will TikTok have in place for the Australian elec(cid:415)on? 

I trust most of these will be pre(cid:425)y straight forward but wanted to give you a bit of advance no(cid:415)ce. Apologies its 
arriving on the day of the mee(cid:415)ng but I had to take some unforeseen leave last week. 

Please let me know if you any ques(cid:415)on or would like any further context. Otherwise, we will see you at 1pm. 

Cheers,

Hi there  

Thanks so much for your email, we'd be happy to meet with you all. But we do have some restrained 
availability over the few weeks, and teams based in Singapore so later in the day is preferred for us. 

If it's possible to push the meeting until the second last week of September? Alternatively, the week 
starting 8 October would be easier again for us.  

Does your team have availability then?

Good morning 

We hope this email finds you well. 

As you would be aware, the AEC is preparing for the next federal election (FE24/25); while the date is yet 
to be determined by government, it could be called at any time with the latest date for it to be held 
being in May 2025. We would therefore like to arrange a meeting with you (and/or appropriate 
representatives as you see fit) in preparation. 

Given you will likely be quite busy in the lead up to the US Presidential election on 5 November, we 
would like to propose a meeting this month. 

At this meeting we would be interested in covering: 

 an update from the AEC on Australia’s electoral integrity environment 

 an update from TikTok about your observations and lessons learned from recent 
elections around the globe and how these experiences are shaping your work 

2

s 47Fs 47Fs 47Es 47Es 47Fs 47Fs 47Fs 47Fs47F

 how TikTok are responding to electoral integrity risks, with a particular focus on how 
we can ensure the Australian public has access to timely and accurate information 
about the electoral process 

 confirming the options and/or escalation pathways for the EIAT and the AEC to flag 
potential issues with TikTok in relation to Australian federal electoral events 

 discuss the (FE24/25) version of the Online Platform Scenarios, which, although 
similar to the Referendum scenarios, has had some updates 

Grateful if you could please advise which (if any) of the following dates would be suitable for a 
September meeting.  

We would be aiming for a one-hour window within the following times. 

Tuesday, 17 September 8am to 9.30am 

Wednesday, 18 September 8am to 10am 

Thursday, 19 September 8am to 9.30am 

Friday, 20 September 8am to 9.30am

If you were able to please review the copy, and provide any feedback? It is very similar to the 2022 hub 
that we partnered on, so hoping this should be a relatively straight forward review. Also chasing the best

Stop and consider 

During an election, people or groups may try to influence the way you vote. 

Stop and consider what you’re seeing, hearing or reading. Check multiple sources of information, 
particularly if you’re not sure of the information's authenticity. For information about the Australian 
federal election - including voting processes and your rights and obligations under Australian law - go to 
the AEC.  

  Tips to ‘stop and consider’  
 

Learn about the voting process  

Ways to vote 
Australia has some of the best voting options in the world.  

If you can vote on election day, then that is what you should do. If you can’t make it on election day you 
can vote during the two-week early voting period – either in-person or via post. Plan your vote according 
to your circumstances. 

  Election day: in your local area or at dedicated interstate voting centres.  

  Pre-polling: in-person at an early voting centre - anywhere around Australia or at an overseas 

voting centre 

  Mobile voting: via a mobile voting team visiting remote communities, residential care facilities, 

some hospitals and a range of other locations of need.    

  Postal voting: if you can't make it to a voting centre 

Head here for more information and options. 

Preferential voting 
Voting in the federal election is compulsory for all Australian citizens aged 18+ on the electoral roll. Know 
how the Australian preferential voting system works before you head to a voting centre 

Where to vote 
Voting locations will be available in the week before the voting period starts.  

-  Find your federal electoral division 
-  Find my nearest voting centre
