Telephone voting for COVID-19 affected voters: How to 
register 

Eligibility for telephone voting service 

The service is only for people who’ve tested positive to COVID-19 after 6pm Friday 13 May and 
will still be in isolation on Saturday 21 May. 

You must meet strict eligibility requirements and register by 4.00pm local time Saturday 21 May. 

How to register to vote by phone 

Go to aec.gov.au/covid and follow the prompts. This is the quickest way to register. You can also 
call 1800 413 960, but there may be lengthy wait times. 

Step 1 
Prepare evidence of being COVID-19 positive. This should be: 

• 

• 

If PCR – the location/address of the testing centre, the date and time you received your 
positive test result and the reference number from by your health authority when notified of 
your positive result (if provided). 

If RAT – the brand and serial number of your test (if available), the date and time of your 
positive RAT result, and if provided, a reference number from your health authority when 
you notified them of your positive result. 

Step 2 
Call 1800 413 960. You can ask for an interpreter who speaks your language. Have your evidence 
ready, as during the call you’ll be asked to declare that you’re unable to attend a polling place 
because you’re isolating with COVID-19. You will also be asked to select a six-digit secure PIN. 

Step 3 
You will be sent an eight-digit phone voting registration number by SMS or email. You will need to 
use the PIN and registration number when you call to cast your vote, rather than providing your 
name and address, so your vote remains secret. 

Registration operating hours 

Online registration

Why should I have to vote if I have COVID-19? Will I be fined 
if I have COVID-19 and don’t vote? 

Why should I have to vote if I have COVID-19 

We want to make sure all eligible people are supported to cast a vote and have their say in 
Australia’s future. The phone voting service was introduced as an emergency measure knowing 
many people would be in isolation on election day and still need a way to vote. A reminder that 
voting is also compulsory for Australian citizens aged 18 years and over. 

Fines for not voting 

If you have a valid and sufficient reason for not voting and get a notice, you can write back to 
explain the reason why you couldn’t vote. You should include evidence of being COVID-19 
positive after 6.00pm local time Friday 13 May and will be in isolation on Saturday 21 May. The 
email address is reason@aec.gov.au. 

People who are deaf and COVID-19 positive 

If you’re eligible, you can phone vote with an Auslan interpreter. There are two ways to access the 
service: 

• 

• 

the Convo Australia website – http://www.convoaustralia.com/vote 

the Convo Australia app (download on your personal device (smartphone or tablet). Simply 
tap the AEC logo to make a direct connection with an Auslan interpreter. 

Your interpreter will then connect you to the secure telephone voting service number and assist 
you with your vote. 

Applied for but haven't received postal vote 

If you tested COVID-19 positive after 6pm Friday 13 May, you can register to vote by phone. Make 
sure you call to vote as soon as you can after this, as there might be a long wait on election day. 

Received postal vote but now eligible for phone vote 

There’s still time to complete and return it to us. Ballot papers must be completed and witnessed 
on or before election day and sent back by Fri 3 June. It could be a long wait on the phone on 
election day. 

I can’t find the serial number on my RAT. 

The location will depend on the brand of RAT you used. The number could be on the front or back 
of the packet, or next to an image or icon. It’s ok if you can’t find it – but to prove eligibility, you do 
need to provide the brand and receipt number from the health authority that registered the positive 
test (if available).

--- Page 6 ---

I can’t find my registration number or PIN 

When you registered, the operator will have asked if you wanted to receive your registration 
number and PIN by SMS or email. You might like to re-check your phone or inbox in case the 
message went into another folder. If you still can’t find either number, you can call 1800 413 960 to 
register again. 

The phone wait time is too long; I can’t get through; I don’t 
want to wait on hold; How long is the hold time? 

Phone wait times 

We know it’s frustrating to wait on the phone, especially if you’re not feeling well. I understand the 
service is experiencing high demand, which means it might take longer for you get through. 
Thanks for your patience as we work to help all eligible people cast their vote. 

Can’t get through 

I understand the service is experiencing high demand, which means it might take longer for you 
get through. Thanks for your patience as we work to help all eligible people cast their vote. 

How long voting takes by phone 

This is not a service the AEC usually provides, so voting by phone will take longer than if this was 
done in person or by post. The operator needs to follow a process that keeps your vote secure. 
They must confirm your details, find the ballot papers for your electoral division, record how you 
wish to vote for both papers, read back your selection and then re-confirm this is how you wish to 
vote.  

To make things quicker and reduce wait times, visit the AEC website to look at an image of ballot 
papers for your electoral division and consider your preferences before calling to vote. 

What will happen if I’m still on hold after 6pm on election 
day? 

You’ll still be able to cast your vote if you registered and are waiting on the line to vote when polls 
close at 6.00pm on Saturday 21 May. You won’t be able to vote if you call after 6.00pm. 

What happens to completed ballot papers after I vote by 
phone? What happens to my personal information? 

What happens to completed ballot papers 

After voting closes on election day, envelopes will be sorted, reconciled, and packed for secure 
dispatch to their home division. There, they’ll be receipted, opened, and counted from the 
Wednesday after election day.

Security of ballot papers 

Ballot paper handling requirements in call centres are subject to the same stringent handling and 
reconciliation requirements as in-person polling places. Votes will only be counted after secure 
return to the relevant divisional offices, which is also conducted under scrutineer observation. 

What happens to my personal information 

We handle personal information in accordance with privacy legislation, and this includes securely 
storing the info provided when you register. Visit the privacy page of our website for details. 

We won’t ask for your personal details when you call to vote. You’ll quote a registration number we 
provided to you by SMS or email. This ensures your vote stays secret. 

How is the service scrutineered 

It's the same as every voting process we deliver. Candidates and party-appointed scrutineers can 
observe, or you can ask that a scrutineer not do this if it’s your preference. Votes will only be 
counted after secure return to the relevant divisional offices, which is also conducted under 
scrutineer observation. 

I don’t want to vote by phone; I want to vote online. 

No online voting for federal elections is available, regardless of personal circumstances. 

I’m overseas. Can I use the phone voting service? 

No, the phone voting service is only able to be used by eligible individuals in Australia. 

COVID-19 affected voters calling from Norfolk and Cocos 
(Keeling) Islands 

Advice provided to Service Officers 

For callers from Norfolk and Cocos (Keeling) Islands who call and request to be transferred to 
the COVID-19-affected Secure Telephone Voting service you can do so. 

Please note: do not transfer any callers other than from Norfolk and Cocos Islands to the Secure 
Telephone Service. 

How is the AEC managing the COVID-19 rules in relation to 
hygiene and physical distancing? 

The Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) has worked closely with the Department of Health to 
manage the risks around COVID-19 at the next election. If you attend an Early Voting Centre or a 
Polling Place, you will notice changes from previous elections. 

Precautionary measure have been put in place to help protect electors and polling staff, including: 

7


--- Page 8 ---

•  The number of people allowed in a voting venue will comply with Health guidelines, based 

on the size of the venue 

•  Hand sanitiser will be available throughout all Early Voting Centres and Polling Places 

•  Voting screens, common surfaces and touch points will be cleaned regularly, 

•  How-to-vote cards will not be used more than once 

•  A Queue Controller will ensure the room capacity is maintained with safe queue distancing 

observed 

•  A Hygiene Officer will also oversee that hygiene is maintained within the polling place 

•  Bio-waste bins will be provided on site to dispose of used PPE. 

•  Signage on hygiene and social distancing will be displayed around the polling place as well 

as floor markers 

We are also asking people to bring their own pencil – a big change from past election. Single use 
pencils will be available if required and can be kept by the voter or disposed of in the bin near the 
polling place exit. 

Physical distancing rules and increased cleaning may mean voting will take a little longer than 
normal – so make sure you plan ahead.
