Spear Phishing Attempt Against the AEC

Overview 

•  There was a ‘spear phishing’ email campaign against the AEC in November 2023. A phishing campaign 
is typically an email scam designed to steal personal information from victims and spear phishing is 
when the campaign is targeted or more specific to the recipient/s. 

•  AEC systems were not compromised in any way and the incident was managed internally. 

• 

. 

•  We shared this information with the EIAT on the basis that despite being contained, the campaign 

appeared targeted and somewhat sophisticated. 

• 

It is also a reminder to be vigilant against cyber threats in the lead up to, and throughout, the proposed 
referendum.
