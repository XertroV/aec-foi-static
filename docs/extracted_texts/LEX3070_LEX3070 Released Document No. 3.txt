Request	for	Review	of	Decision	to	Deregister
Flux

To:	Mr	Tom	Rogers,	Australian	Electoral	Commissioner

CC:	The	other	members	of	the	Commission:	Justice	Kenny,	Chairperson,	and	Dr	Gruen,	the	Australian

Statistician.

This	is	a	request	for	the	Commission	to	review	the	decision,	made	on	the	24th	of	March	2022,	to

deregister	“VOTEFLUX.ORG	|	Upgrade	Democracy!”	(Flux)	under	s137(6)	of	the	Electoral	Act.	It	is

made	under	s141(2)	of	the	Electoral	Act.

I	am	making	this	request	because	the	AEC	has	been	using	and	continues	to	use	a	faulty	method	to

test	party	eligibility	with	regards	to	sufficient	membership.	Thus,	I	am	dissatisfied	with	the	decision

to	deregister	Flux.	Additionally,	as	an	Australian	elector,	a	fundamental	oversight	in	the	AEC’s	policy

could	compromise	the	democracy	that	I	am	a	constituent	of,	so	I	am	affected,	along	with	all	other

Australians.	As	part	of	this	request,	I	provide	statistical	analysis	as	grounds	that	the	AEC’s	testing

method	is	flawed.

My	Statement	to	the	Commission

I	invite	the	Commission	–	Mr	Rogers	along	with	Justice	Kenny	and	Dr	Gruen	–	to	consider	the

following	hypothetical	case	regarding	the	AEC’s	method	for	validating	that	a	party	meets	the

requirements	of	the	Electoral	Act.	I	assume	that	you	all	are	familiar	with	the	AEC’s	testing

methodology.

Consider	a	party	with	9,000	members,	and	let’s	say	that	half	of	those	members	(4,500)	are

validatable	as	electors,	and	a	further	60%	of	those	members	(2,700)	will	respond	“yes”	to	an	AEC

request	for	membership	confirmation.	It	is	natural	for	a	party	to	have	members	that	can	not	be

validated	against	the	electoral	roll	(which	can	happen	for	a	variety	of	reasons;	a	member’s	status	of

silent	elector	is	one).	Thus,	parties	go	to	some	substantial	effort	to	submit	only	those	members	that

can	be	validated	against	the	roll	–	for	reasons	that	I	hope	are	obvious	to	you	who	comprise	the

Commission.

That	is,	in	our	hypothetical	case:	4,500	members	are	not	validatable	as	electors,	and	a	further	1,800

would	deny	membership	if	asked	by	the	AEC.	The	remaining	2,700	are	legitimate.

Justice	Kenny,	as	I’m	sure	you’re	aware,	the	Electoral	Act	(EA)	specifies	that	an	eligible	party

requires	at	least	1,500	members.	In	your	legal	opinion,	would	a	party	with	2,700	members	satisfy

that	clause	of	the	EA?

I	hope	that	you	agree	that	it	would.	I	anticipate	that	you	would	also	agree	that,	all	else	being	equal,
this	hypothetical	party	appears	eligible	under	the	EA.	At	the	very	least,	we	do	not	have	a	reason	to
conclude	that	the	party	is	ineligible,	right?

Dr	Gruen,	I	wonder	if	you	are	a	man	dedicated	to	facts	and	truth	or	falsehoods	and	political	agendas.
I’m	sure	that,	as	an	expert	statistician,	you	hold	mathematical	facts	above	unsubstantiated	claims.
I’m	also	sure	that	you	appreciate	that	if	a	statistical	test	has	a	predetermined	outcome,	then	that
test	is	neither	reliable	nor	suitable	for	any	real-world	purpose.	If	you	had	a	blood	sample	processed
by	a	doctor,	would	you	accept	the	results	if	that	doctor	gave	them	to	you	before	the	blood	sample

was	taken?	No,	of	course	not,	that	would	be	crazy.

So,	Dr	Gruen,	please	consider	our	hypothetical	case.	Given	that	this	hypothetical	party	is	eligible

under	the	EA,	what	should	we	expect	as	the	results	of	the	AEC’s	testing	method	as	applied	to	this

party?	Given	that	this	party	cannot	determine	which	of	the	4,500	validatable	members	will	respond

“yes”	or	“no”,	and	that	this	party	can	submit	no	more	than	1,650	members	due	to	AEC	policy	alone:

the	best	that	can	be	done	is	selecting	a	subset	of	those	members,	essentially	at	random.	There	may

be	some	small	optimizations	the	party	could	make,	but	in	principle	the	limiting	factors	are	those	that

we	have	already	discussed.	Thus	each	member	on	the	submitted	list	is	expected	to	respond	to	the

AEC	with	a	membership	denial	with	a	probability	of	0.4	(40%).	Of	course,	we	know	this	because

1,800	/	(2,700	+	1,800)	=	0.4,	and	because	there	is	no	reason	that	the	ratio	of	denying	members	to

confirming	members	would	change	substantially	(outside	the	statistical	variance	of	the	selection	of

1,650	members,	which	is	not	very	substantial	anyway).

Let	us	assume	that	this	hypothetical	party	randomly	selects	1,650	validatable	members	from	its	pool

of	4,500.	Dr	Gruen,	I	hope	that	you	find	this	a	reasonable	course	of	action	for	the	party	to	take	and

have	followed	the	logic	thus	far.

Dr	Gruen,	would	you	agree	that	the	accuracy	of	a	statistical	method	is	roughly:	how	often	it	results	in

true	positives	and	true	negatives?	That	is:	if	a	method	results	in	false	positives	and	false	negatives

some	of	the	time,	it	cannot	have	100%	accuracy.	If,	for	some	cases,	it	only	produces	false	positives

and	false	negatives,	then	it	has	0%	accuracy	for	those	cases.	If	there	exists	some	case	where	the

method	will	always	result	in	false	negatives,	then	we	can	conclude	that	such	a	method	is,	at	least

sometimes,	inaccurate,	yes?

I	invite	you,	Dr	Gruen,	to	please	calculate	the	probability	that	this	hypothetical	party	passes	the
AEC’s	membership	testing	methodology	–	that	the	party	passes	the	test	that	is	endorsed	by	your

bureau.	You	may	assume	that	no	members	are	filtered	out,	i.e.,	that	during	the	AEC’s	validation	of

the	membership	list	no	electors	are	excluded	for	being	duplicates,	or	deceased,	or	unmatchable

against	the	electoral	roll,	etc.

All	the	information	required	for	such	a	calculation	is	specified	above.	I	assume	that	such	a	calculation

is	trivial	for	a	statistician	such	as	yourself,	with	the	resources	available	to	you.	Surely,	you	agree	that

it	is	fairly	straight	forward	to	calculate,	yes?

Mr	Rogers,	while	Dr	Gruen	is	calculating	that	probability,	let	us	discuss	something	that	you	wrote

recently:

The	AEC’s	values	of	electoral	integrity	through	agility,	professionalism	and	quality	underpin

everything	we	do	[…]

I	also	believe	that	integrity	is	important.	Integrity	is	necessary	for	a	system	(or	a	person)	to	remain

robust.	Integrity	is	a	major	difference	between	‘stable	and	enduring’,	and	‘compromised	and

corrupted’.	When	integrity	fails,	good	systems	become	rotten.	Do	you	not	agree?

It	is	to	your	integrity,	and	the	integrity	of	Justice	Kenny	and	Dr	Gruen,	too,	that	I	make	this	appeal.	I
am	fully	aware	that	you	are	free	to	decide	whatever	you	wish	–	the	Electoral	Act	is	written	such	that
you	are	practically	unconstrained	in	this	matter.

I	ask	you	this:	if	the	AEC	and	the	ABS	were	wrong	about	the	AEC’s	testing	methodology,	how	would
you	know?	Surely	you	realize	that	it	is	possible	that	the	AEC	is	mistaken	somehow	–	that	we	are	all
fallible,	and	our	ideas	are	fallible?	Institutions	like	the	AEC,	and	methods	like	the	one	the	AEC	use,
are	based	on	ideas	that	were	thought-up	by	people,	and	are	therefore	fallible.

Justice	Kenny	and	Dr	Gruen,	do	you	also	realize	this?	That	there	are	no	infallible	humans,	no	infallible

institutions,	and	no	infallible	ideas?

Mr	Rogers,	if	it	is	possible	to	be	wrong,	what	does	it	mean	to	have	integrity	in	the	face	of	potentially

being	wrong,	and	thus	potentially	making	progress?	Should	one	take	the	path	of	honesty	and	truth-

LEX3070 Released Document No. 3Released under the Freedom of Information Act 1982


--- Page 3 ---

seeking,	or	should	one	take	the	path	of	enforcing	authority	through	baseless	claims,	evasion,	and

dismissal?	If	you	have	some	other	path	to	take,	is	it	not	one	of	honesty	and	truth-seeking?	Surely

you	would	not	advocate	a	path	that	is	dishonest	and	avoids	the	truth?	Perhaps	Justice	Kenny	has

some	insight	on	this;	I	understand	that	judges	often	have	some	experience	in	these	matters.

Now,	let	us	return	to	the	matter	of	the	accuracy	of	the	AEC’s	testing	methodology.	Dr	Gruen,	are	you

done	calculating	those	probabilities?	Let	us	compare	answers.

Here	are	my	results	with	95%	confidence	intervals:	the	probability	that	the	hypothetical	party	passes

the	AEC’s	testing	method	is	0.0020%	±	0.0012%.	The	mean	membership	denials	via	the	AEC’s	test	is

	=	23.998	±	0.010	(out	of	60	successful	contacts).	The	standard	deviation	of	that	distribution	is	

=	3.765	±	0.007.	The	SEM	for	these	results	is	

	=	0.005.

Dr	Gruen,	would	you	consider	a	statistical	method	accurate	if	the	probability	of	it	producing	a	false

negative	is	99.9980%	±	0.0012%?	Would	you	consider	that,	for	all	intents	and	purposes,	such	a

statistical	method	is	predetermined	in	its	outcome?

Justice	Kenny,	do	you	consider	it	appropriate	for	an	important	legal	institution	to	use	a	method	that,

in	some	conditions,	fails	more	than	99%	of	the	time?	What	would	our	society	be	like	if	the	courts	had

this	kind	of	failure	rate	for	certain	types	of	cases?	How	do	we	know	that	they	don’t?	How	does	the
AEC	know	that	its	method	doesn’t?	Why	are	the	answers	to	those	questions	different?

Mr	Rogers,	do	you	think	that	a	test	which,	in	some	cases	has	a	failure	rate	greater	than	99%,	should

be	used	by	a	leader	who	values	integrity	and	quality?	Do	you	think	that	a	test	which,	when	applied	to

certain	cases,	succeeds	only	0.002%	of	the	time	is	“rational,	fair	and	practical	in	all	the

circumstances”?	[1]

/notice-of-decision-with-reasons-SUPA.pdf

Dr	Gruen,	do	you	think	that	a	test	which,	for	certain	cases,	is	less	than	1%	accurate	is	“rational,	fair

and	practical	in	all	the	circumstances”?	After	all,	it	is	a	fact	that	the	AEC’s	method	performs	this

poorly	some	of	the	time.	You	have	calculated	so	yourself.	( ou	have	done	the	calculations,	haven’t

you?)

Justice	Kenny,	do	you	think	that,	when	a	citizen	appeals	to	a	judicial	process	of	their	country’s	legal

institutions,	they	deserve	the	right	to	be	taken	seriously?	That	they	deserve	the	right	to	present	their

case	and,	if	it	is	supported	by	the	facts,	to	have	an	injustice	undone?	Is	that	not	one	of	the	primary

values	of	judicial	processes	and	the	courts?	To	safeguard	citizenry	from	injustices?	To	undo	decisions
that	would	otherwise	be	mistakes?	Is	that	not	something	that	the	integrity	of	our	legal	institutions
depend	on?	Is	the	AEC	not	part	of	the	bedrock	of	our	legal	system?	(Its	foundational	role	being	that	it
provides	the	system	by	which	parliamentarians,	who	alone	can	create	and	modify	legislation,	are
elected.)

If	a	citizen	petitions	an	institution	via	a	judicial	process,	and	proves	their	case	with	mathematics	and
evidence,	what	are	they	to	do	if	that	is	not	enough?	If	that	institution	is	unconvinced	by	facts	and
evidence,	how	can	a	citizen	have	confidence	in	their	legal	system?	How	can	they	have	confidence	in
that	foundational	component	of	our	society?

Moreover,	if	judicial	processes	ignore	facts	and	evidence,	are	those	processes	serving	one	of	their

major	purposes	–	error	correction?	Is	that	not	a	core	goal	of	judicial	processes:	righting	wrongs,

undoing	mistakes,	preventing	mistakes,	promoting	justice,	and	so	on?	What	is	a	citizen	to	do	when	a
judicial	process	ignores	facts	and	evidence?

Mr	Rogers,	I	cannot	force	you	to	change	your	mind	about	anything,	that	is	solely	up	to	you.

I	can	present	you	with	this	case,	though.	Perhaps	you	(along	with	Justice	Kenny	and	Dr	Gruen)	have

guessed	that	the	hypothetical	party	was	not	so	hypothetical	after	all.	The	parameters	of	that	case

are	spitting	distance	from	those	of	Flux’s	second	membership	test	(conducted	Feb/March	2022).

There	is	at	least	one	major	difference	–	in	the	hypothetical	case,	the	party	selected	members

randomly;	in	Flux’s	case,	your	delegate	selected	1,650	members	from	the	top	of	the	list	of	4,680

members	that	Flux	submitted.	That	list	was	alphabetical,	so	the	AEC	only	sampled	from	members

whose	first	name	started	with	one	of	A	through	G.

Dr	Gruen,	in	your	expert	opinion	and	in	light	of	the	above,	and	given	that	Flux	failed	this	test,	which

of	these	should	we	believe	true?

That	Flux	has	fewer	than	1,500	members;	or

That	Flux	has	fewer	than	1,500	members	whose	first	name	starts	with	one	of	A	through	G.

If	a	party	has	1,000	(~1586	*	29/(17+29))	members	whose	first	name	starts	with	one	of	A	through	G,

how	many	members	whose	name	starts	with	one	of	H	through	Z	do	we	expect	that	party	to	have?

After	all,	what	are	the	chances	that	a	party	only	has	members	with	first	names	that	start	with	a	letter

between	A	and	G	inclusive.

The	point	of	this	argument	is	not	that	Flux	has	sufficient	members	to	satisfy	the	electoral	act.	The

point	of	this	argument	is	that	the	AEC’s	method	is	flawed.	It	is	inaccurate,	it	is	unreliable,	it	is	unfair,

and	it	is	unsuitable	–	at	least	in	this	case.	The	facts	prove	this.

I	am	not	asking	that	the	Commission	believe	me,	I	am	asking	the	Commission	to	believe	facts	and

evidence.

Justice	Kenny,	I	will	ask	you	again,	does	a	citizen	deserve	the	right	to	present	their	case	via	a	judicial

process	and,	if	it	is	supported	by	the	facts,	to	have	an	injustice	undone?	I	hope	that	your	answer	is

the	same	in	this	case	as	it	would	have	been	for	all	other	cases	that	you	have	presided	over	as	a

Judge	of	the	Court.

The	above	is	sufficient	to	conclude	that	Flux	was	wrongfully	deregistered.	It	was	wrongful	because,

regardless	of	whether	Flux	should	be	deregistered	or	not,	the	AEC’s	method	is	not	good	enough	to

produce	an	accurate	result	in	this	case.	From	a	truth-seeking	point	of	view,	the	AEC’s	test	provides

no	meaningful	information	on	whether	Flux	is	eligible	or	not.	Since	we	should	not	take	my	word	for	it,

if	our	goal	is	to	determine	whether	Flux	is	eligible	with	regards	to	sufficient	membership,	we	are	at

square	one.	Scientifically,	we	can	draw	no	conclusions	based	on	the	AEC’s	testing.	It	is	not	my	place
to	tell	you	what	should	be	done	instead	of	the	current	method,	I	can	only	demonstrate	to	you	that

the	outcome	is	predetermined	in	Flux’s	case,	as	the	test	results	in	a	false	negative	with	probability
0.999978	±	0.000013.	(These	numbers	differ	slightly	from	those	in	the	hypothetical	case	above
because	the	calculations	are	based,	specifically,	on	Flux’s	second	test.)

Mr	Rogers,	Justice	Kenny,	and	Dr	Gruen:	perhaps	this	is	not	enough	to	convince	that	there	is	a
reasonable	chance	of	some	problems	with	the	AEC’s	methodology.	The	only	other	thing	I	can	do	is
present	you	with	a	more	in-depth	statistical	analysis	of	the	method	–	covering	this	problem	and
others,	both	historical	and	on-going.	I	suppose	that	it	is	most	relevant	for	Dr	Gruen,	since	he	is	the
only	one	I	can	reasonably	expect	to	have	the	knowledge	of	statistics	necessary	to	judge	the	analysis.
To	my	knowledge,	this	is	the	first	third	party	review	of	the	AEC’s	methodology.	If	there	has	been	a
third	party	review	that	is	not	public,	I	think	that	it	is	reasonable	for	the	Commission	to	provide	it

(without	an	FOI	request).

After	I	sign	off,	you	will	find	supporting	graphs	of	the	Probability	Mass	Functions	comprising	the

statistical	analysis	from	which	my	above	results	were	drawn.	Following	that,	the	in-depth	review	of

therefore	constitutes	a	case	where	the	AEC's	method	is	completely	inaccurate.

99.99%	of	the	time.

Abstract	/	Executive	Summary

In	Australia,	to	register	a	political	party	you	need	a	minimum	number	of	members.	Federally,	that’s

usually	1500	(as	of	September	2021)	–	the	Australian	Electoral	Commission	(AEC)	will	conduct

membership	tests	to	verify	this	minimum.	Political	parties	with	a	parliamentarian	have	no	minimum

membership	limit	and	are	not	tested.	Political	parties	without	a	parliamentarian	must	go	through	a

membership	test	when	they	register,	and	then	once	every	election	cycle	thereafter.

This	document	evaluates	the	AEC’s	testing	methodology	for	particular	cases	and	finds	that	there	are
real-world	situations	where	the	testing	methodology	has	a	false	negative	(improper	failure)	rate	over
50%,	and	often	much	higher.

Therefore,	it	is	reasonable	to	conclude,	for	those	cases:	the	methodology	is	rigged	and	a	farce.

If	something	is	rigged	and	a	farce	–	based	on	the	definitions	included	and	cited	in	the	appendix	–
then	it	is	an	unfair,	empty	act,	done	for	show	where	the	outcome	is	already	known.	This	document
proves	that	the	current	method	has	unfair	and	predetermined	outcomes	for	many	situations.

Note:	I	am	not	accusing	the	AEC	of	doing	the	rigging;	just	proving	that	the	method	is
rigged.

To	date,	there	is	1	known	incident	of	a	farce,	at	least	5	suspected	incidents,	at	at	least	5	other

possible	farces.	This	is	based	only	on	results	that	the	AEC	have	published	as	part	of	a	review	(other

LEX3070 Released Document No. 3Released under the Freedom of Information Act 1982


--- Page 8 ---

results	are	not	available).

The	Flux	Party’s	recent	2021	membership	test	is	analyzed	in	multiple	ways:

Measured	case:	a	17%	membership	denial	rate	–	as	measured	by	the	AEC	during	this

membership	test.

More	extreme	–	but	realistic	–	cases:	These	are	more	extreme	cases	than	the	measured

case,	but	it	is	an	assumption	of	all	cases	that	the	party	is	eligible	under	the	Electoral	Act.

Threshold	case:	the	case	where	9.09%	(150/1650)	of	any	membership	list	submitted	will	deny

membership.	I	suspect	this	is	close	to	an	AEC	assumption	used	for	calculating	the	maximum

number	of	denials	for	the	AEC’s	testing	table	(given	their	advertised	risk	of	false	results).

Experimental	evidence	shows	that	the	measured	true	positive	rate	of	The	Flux	Party’s	2021

membership	test	was	just	28.3%	±	0.12%.	This	is	despite	the	experimental	assumption	that	Flux

has	more	members	than	the	legislatively	required	number.

In	Flux’s	threshold	case,	where	150/1650	=	9.09%	of	the	submitted	membership	list	will	deny

membership	and	24	members	are	filtered	without	replacement,	experimental	evidence	shows	that

the	AEC	method’s	true	positive	rate	was	89.0%,	which	is	less	than	the	limit	previously	advertised

(90%	or	better).	The	true	positive	rate	is	that	high	because	Flux	has	gone	to	a	great	deal	of	effort	to

increase	the	quality	of	our	membership	lists	to	avoid	members	being	filtered	–	we	did	this,	in	large

part,	to	address	inadequacies	of	the	AEC’s	methodology.	As	more	members	are	filtered

without	replacement,	the	false	negative	rate	increases	dramatically.

Experimental	evidence	proves	that	the	AEC’s	claim	that	their	membership	tests	are	90%

accurate	is	false.	In	actual	fact,	for	a	party	that	is	capable	of	providing	a	list	of	1,650	members

wherein	exactly	1,500	members	will	not	deny	membership	(and	150	will):	the	worst-case

accuracy	of	the	AEC’s	membership	test	is	just	15.1%,	indicating	a	false	negative	rate	of

84.9%.

In	other	cases,	where	a	party	is	capable	of	providing	1,500	members	that	will	not	deny	membership

(with	no	limit	on	the	number	of	members	that	will	deny	membership),	the	lower-bound	on	the

accuracy	of	the	AEC’s	method	is	0%.	That	is:	it	fails	100%	of	the	time	for	certain	eligible	parties.

This	is	not	a	theoretical	problem.	It	has	been	happening	and	continues	to	happen.	The	AEC	has	been

enforcing	a	policy	that	compromises	the	integrity	of	our	political	process.	The	ABS	has	been

complicit.	Political	elites	have	exploited	this.

Additionally,	the	AEC	mistakenly	enforced	a	testing	table	with	a	typo	for	4	years	–	it’s	unknown	if

they	ever	noticed	before	the	table	was	updated.	(See	Appendix:	AEC	Membership	Testing	Tables	/
Circa	2012	to	2016)

1.	Background	Context

Recently	(leading	up	to	September	2021),	most	parliamentarians	(i.e.,	the	4	major	parties)	decided

LEX3070 Released Document No. 3Released under the Freedom of Information Act 1982


--- Page 9 ---

that	we	had	too	many	political	parties	and	that	this	was	a	problem!	It	would	not	do.	So,	a	bunch	of

changes	were	made	to	the	Electoral	Act.	Changes	designed	to	make	life	harder	for	anyone	who

wanted	to	be	part	of	our	democracy,	but	did	not	want	to	participate	in	the	rotten,	tribalist,	political

cults	that	run	the	show.	Some	of	those	changes	resulted	in	(as	of	Feb	2022)	the	pending

deregistration	of	12	parties,	and	the	very	real	deregistration	of	9	parties.	In	practice	that	is	~40%	of

parties,	gone	before	the	next	election.	Political	elites	will	claim	(and	have	claimed	in	Parliament

already)	that	these	changes,	the	culling,	and	the	subsequent	entrenchment	of	the	status	quo,	is	a

good	thing.	That	it	is	making	our	democracy	better.

In	September	2021,	the	legislatively	required	number	of	members	for	a	political	party	was	increased

from	500	to	1500	with	little	warning	and	no	grace	period.	The	AEC’s	policies	–	going	back	at	least	a

decade	–	have	encouraged	parties	not	to	bother	going	over	1.1x	the	legislative	limit	(i.e.,	previously

550,	now	1650)	with	regards	to	their	number	of	members	that	are	verifiable	against	the	roll.

(Submitting	more	than	this	is	pointless	and	makes	registration	harder.)

2.	Regular	Membership	Testing

Every	few	years,	the	Australian	Electoral	Commission	(AEC)	will	check	that	each	political	party	has

enough	members	according	to	the	legislative	requirement.	The	party	must	provide	a	list	of	1500	to
1650	names	(inclusive)	to	use	as	evidence	of	their	eligibility.	The	AEC	will	then	filter	out	some	names

(duplicates,	deceased	members,	etc).	That	produces	a	NEW	list	of	≤	1650	names.	Then,	the	AEC	will

do	a	statistical	sampling	of	members	and	will	use	that	to	determine	whether	a	party	is	eligible.

Particularly,	a	small	subset	of	members	are	selected	and	contacted,	asking	for	a	yes/no	confirmation

of	membership.	Non-responses	are	skipped.	A	“No”	answer	counts	as	a	failure	–	this	is	a	membership

denial.	In	this	document	and	associated	code:	“failure	rate”	refers	to	the	rate	at	which	members

respond	“No”.

The	AEC	does	not	accept	lists	larger	than	1650;	there	is	no	chance	for	a	party	to	replace	any	of	those
filtered	members;	that	filtering	process	increases	the	chance	of	false	negatives	(when	list	length	is

limited	+	excluding	duplicates);	parties	are	not	told	which	members	were	filtered	(even	those	which

are	deceased)	so	they	cannot	be	proactively	removed;	and,	finally,	the	standard	of	statistical

evaluation	is	to	assume	that	the	list	of	1650	members	were	the	only	members	of	the	party.	Zero

consideration	is	given	beyond	this,	outside	the	chance	to	respond	–	a	tactic	that	has,	historically,

performed	poorly	except	by	the	grace	of	the	AEC.	How	many	parties	have	been	wrongly	denied

registration	due	to	this	artificial	limit?	Nobody	knows.

The	method	is	detailed	on	pages	23	and	24	of	“Guide	for	registering	a	party”.	(mirror)

3.	Flux’s	2021	Membership	Test:	A	Known	Farce

Flux	failed	its	recent	membership	test.	The	only	problem?	We	have	at	least	4680	members	whose
details	have	been	matched	against	the	electoral	roll.	It	is	the	AEC’s	imposition	of	1650	members
maximum	that	is	the	problem.

Note	that	Flux	is	only	in	a	position	to	offer	so	many	members	because	of	our	unique	membership
system:	free	for	life.	Additionally,	significant	automation	has	been	developed	to	assist	members	in
verifying	their	details	against	the	electoral	roll	and	keeping	their	details	up	to	date.	This	is	a	task	too
involved,	expensive,	and	specialized	for	it	to	be	practical	for	most	political	parties.

AEC’s	Notice	to	Flux	(with	test	results)

Our	Response

From	the	AEC’s	notice	(note	that	the	AEC	refuses	membership	lists	with	more	than	1650	members):

LEX3070 Released Document No. 3Released under the Freedom of Information Act 1982


--- Page 10 ---

On	7	December	2021,	the	Party	responded	to	the	s	138A	Notice	by	providing	a	list	of	between

1,500	and	1,650	members	of	the	Party.

I	am	notifying	you	under	s	137(1)(b)	of	the	Electoral	Act	that	the	Electoral	Commission	is

considering	deregistering	the	Party,	as	the	Electoral	Commission	is	satisfied	on	reasonable

grounds	that	the	Party	does	not	have	at	least	1,500	members.	A	copy	of	the	s	137(1)(b)	Notice

is	enclosed.

Here	is	an	except	from	the	first	page	of	our	response,	to	give	you	an	idea	of	the	gist:

We	have	3	arguments	supporting	our	case.	Each	argument	is	individually	sufficient	to	show	that

a	decision	(by	the	AEC)	to	deregister	the	Party	would	not	be	based	on	reasonable	grounds;	each

argument	is	a	decisive	criticism	of	the	current	methodology.

The	statistical	method	used	fails	~10%	of	the	time	for	borderline	cases.

The	statistical	method	uses	an	artificially	limited	sample	size	and	thus	does	not	estimate

party	membership,	though	does	(roughly)	measure	membership	attrition.

We	have	sufficient	membership	and	provide	evidence.	Attached	is	a	list	of	4680

members.	Each	entry	was,	at	some	point,	verified	against	the	electoral	roll.

Unless	each	of	these	criticisms	can	be	addressed,	we	do	not	believe	that	a	decision	by	the	AEC

to	deregister	the	Party	would	be	based	in	reality.

(Note:	there	are	at	least	two	non-critical	errors	in	our	response	–	the	AEC	has	already	been	informed.

See	the	end	of	the	doc	for	what	was	sent	to	the	AEC	re	those	errors.)

I	became	curious	about	the	actual	statistical	properties	of	the	AEC’s	process.	How	likely	would	it

have	been	for	us	to	succeed?	(Given	that	we	are	in	fact	an	eligible	party.)

Turns	out	there	was	a	71.7%	chance	that	the	AEC’s	method	would	find	a	false	negative.

TL;DR:	It’s	rigged.

In	this	document	and	the	associated	code	and	graphs:	a	farce	is	defined	as	any	case	where	the

chance	of	a	false	negative	is	≥	50%,	i.e.,	statistical	accuracy	is	≤	50%.

The	AEC’s	membership	test	being	rigged	means	that,	in	some	relevant	cases,	the	outcome	is

predetermined.	Since	there	are	cases	where	an	eligible	party	will	have	~0%	chance	of	success,	it	is

the	case	that	there	exist	relevant	cases	where	the	outcome	is	predetermined.

4.	Analysis	Methodology

The	code	associated	with	this	document	produces	statistical	graphs	(of	the	Probability	Mass
Function,	specifically)	based	on	500,000	simulations	of	the	AEC’s	method.

For	each	simulation,	the	number	of	failures	is	recorded	as	the	output.	Subsequently,	these	results
are	normalized	to	give	the	probability	of	X	failures	for	the	given	input	parameters.	These
probabilities	are	then	graphed,	with	the	x-axis	showing	the	number	of	failures,	and	the	y-axis
showing	
(membership	denials).	As	the	AEC	has	limits	on	the	acceptable	number	of	membership	denials	based

	–	i.e.,	the	probability	of	a	membership	test	having	a	certain	number	of	failures

on	the	reduced	membership	list,	the	bars	in	these	PMFs	are	colored	blue	or	orange	to	indicate	a	pass
or	a	failure.	In	cases	where	the	party	does	meet	legislative	requirements,	the	blue	bars	( P(success) )
should,	according	to	AEC	Policy,	always	sum	to	 >	0.9 .	Where	 P(success)	<	0.5 ,	the	case	is	deemed
a	farce	and	marked	as	such.

What	happens	if	Flux	gains	more	members?

Moreover,	say	that	Flux	is	gaining	members	faster	than	it	is	losing	them.	(‘Losing’	members	means

that	they	will	now	answer	“No”	but	do	not	revoke	their	membership.)	It	turns	out	that	this	can	make

the	AEC’s	methodology	less	likely	to	succeed.	Go	figure:	a	party	increases	it’s	membership	and	the

AEC	test	get’s	less	accurate!	See	Fig	5.2,	Example	5.2.1,	Example	5.2.2	(Filtered=0),	Example	5.2.3

(Filtered=24).

The	system	is	rigged.	It’s	a	farce.

Finally,	there	are	cases	where	the	AEC’s	method	fails	even	more	spectacularly.

Say	50%	of	Flux’s	4680	members	submitted	(as	part	of	our	objection	to	the	AEC’s	consideration	of

involuntary	deregistration)	respond	“No”	–	the	AEC’s	method	fails	100%	of	the	time	in	this	case,

even	though	Flux	would	exceed	the	legislative	requirement	by	1.56x.	See	Fig	5.3,	and	related:

Example	5.3.1.

Update:	additionally,	see	8.	Flux’s	Second	Membership	Test	(March	2022).

Reading	These	Graphs

N	Members:	The	number	of	members	that	the	party	is	capable	of	submitting,	i.e.,	they	are
validated	to	the	best	of	the	party’s	ability.

Submitted:	The	number	of	members	that	the	party	submits	to	the	AEC.

Filtered	Out:	The	number	of	members	removed	without	replacement	by	the	AEC	–	parties	cannot

preemptively	remove	these	members	as	the	AEC	uses	information	that	is	unavailable	to	parties.

Sample:	The	number	of	members	after	AEC	filtering.

P(denial):	The	probability	that	a	member	will	deny	membership	when	contacted.

(Y:	…,	N:	…):	The	number	of	members	that,	when	contacted	by	the	AEC,	will	respectively

respond:	“yes”,	and	“no”.	Note:	if	a	member	does	not	respond	to	a	request	for	contact,	the	AEC
selects	a	new	member	to	contact	from	the	sample.

Simulations:	The	number	of	times	the	AEC	test	was	simulated	while	generating	the	distribution.

Eligible?:	whether	the	party	is	eligible	under	the	Electoral	Act.

Exhaustive	test:	would	the	party	pass	a	membership	test	if	every	member	in	the	sample	group
were	contacted?	Note:	this	is	limited	by	AEC	policy	to	1650	(or	550	prior	to	Sept	2021).

“x	bar”	( ):	The	mean	of	the	distribution,	i.e.,	the	average	number	of	denials.

“sigma	sub	x”	(

):	Standard	deviation	of	the	distribution.

“sigma	sub	x	bar”	(

):	Standard	error	of	the	distribution.

P(Conflict:	AEC	Method	↔	Exhaustive):	The	probability	that	the	AEC’s	method	conflicts	with	the

results	of	an	exhaustive	test.

P(Conflict:	AEC	Method	↔	Reality):	The	probability	AEC’s	method	fails	(i.e.,	produces	a	false

6.	Suspected	Farces

LEX3070 Released Document No. 3Released under the Freedom of Information Act 1982


--- Page 16 ---

Detecting	previous	farces	is	difficult	because	the	AEC	does	not	publish	the	results	of	membership

tests	and,	too	my	knowledge,	does	not	record	or	ask	for	the	number	of	members	a	party	could	offer

in	support	of	their	validity.	Instead,	we	only	know	the	number	of	members	that	were	submitted,

which	is	always	<=	1650	(or	the	limit	in	effect	at	the	time),	and	we	only	know	this	when	the	AEC	has

published	a	statement	of	reasons	which	is	only	done	when	there	is	a	request	for	review.	If	a	party

just	gives	up,	or	otherwise	misses	the	deadline,	then	we	don’t	hear	about	it	and	thus	cannot

evaluate	whether	a	farce	occurred.

Note:	these	cases	occurred	prior	to	the	September	2021	increase	in	required	members.	Therefore

they	are	judged	against	the	previous	requirements	–	the	test	method	was	practically	the	same,	the

only	difference	being	that	it	was	calibrated	for	membership	lists	of	500-550	instead	of	1500-1650.

Since	parties	sometimes	max	out	the	number	of	members	they	may	provide,	the	only	reasonable

conclusion	is	that	they	have	more	members	they	could	provide	if	a	more	responsible	method	were

used.

Therefore,	parties	are	assumed	to	have	just	enough	excess	capacity	in	additional	members	to	be

eligible,	and	that	those	extra	members	could	have	been	provided.

Excess	Capacity	Explanation

Excess	capacity	here	refers	to	additional	members	that,	if	not	for	the	AEC’s	limit,	a	party	could

provide	–	expressed	as	a	percentage	of	the	limit.	If	a	party	requires	10%	excess	capacity,	and	the

limit	of	a	membership	list	is	1650,	then	that	party	must	be	capable	of	providing	a	list	of	1815

members	that	a	list	of	1650	members	is	randomly	sampled	from.

For	comparison:	in	Flux’s	case,	we	had	3030	additional	members	(excess	capacity	of	184%)	–

excluding	those	that	we	could	not	validate.	The	AEC	is	sometimes	able	to	validate	members	that	we

cannot,	and	we	have	at	least	4285	additional	members	that	we	could	contact	with	a	request	for

them	to	update	their	details.

What	about	cases	where	the	member	list	submitted	had	a	large	number	of	duplicates?	It	is	not	safe

to	assume	the	absence	of	a	farce	in	these	cases:	maintaining	membership	lists	is	difficult.	In	my

case,	I	wrote	thousands	of	lines	of	custom	code	to	assist	Flux	in	managing	our	member	list	–	and

the	proportion	of	our	list	that	is	automatically	matched	against	the	electoral	roll	is	proof	of	this.	But,

even	with	multiple	checks	for	duplicates	(matching	phone	numbers,	emails,	first	and	last	names,

etc),	still	we	would	occasionally	get	duplicates.	These	stragglers	were	usually	found	through	a

manual	process	before	submission.	At	some	point	it	just	isn’t	worth	worrying	about.	However,	due	to

the	ambiguity	of	these	cases,	this	document	will	exclude	them	from	“suspected”	farces.

The	Suspected	Farces

Since,	in	the	following	cases,	the	excess	capacity	of	the	party	undergoing	testing	was	not	known,
these	are	only	suspected	farces.

1.	 (Fig	6.1)	30	June	2021	–	deregistration	of	Child	Protection	Party	under	s	137(6)	(mirror)	–	excess

2.	 (Fig	6.2)	9	March	2021	–	deregistration	of	Seniors	United	Party	under	s	137(6)	(mirror)	–	excess

Possible	Farces

These	are	cases	where	the	available	information	regarding	the	membership	test	is	incomplete,	so

some	assumptions	have	had	to	be	made.	Based	on	AEC	measurements,	if	the	party	had	some

cases	are	farces.

Flux	is	a	party	that	has	–	with	regards	to	membership	lists	–	excess	capacity;	if	filtered	members

could	be	replaced,	we	could	provide	them.	Note	that	filtered	members	are	never	replaced	in	the

AEC’s	method.

Given	this,	combined	with	the	artificial	limit	on	sample	size,	what	are	the	true	accuracy	values	for

the	AEC’s	test?

As	it	turns	out,	it	depends	on	the	quality	of	Flux’s	membership	list.	We	have	a	high-quality	list	–

thanks	to	a	lot	of	management	code	written	to	help	with	that	–	but	many	parties	do	not	have	the

skills	or	resources	to	do	that.

Fig	7.1	shows	that,	for	Flux’s	recent	membership	test,	the	true	accuracy	of	the	AEC’s	method	–
assuming	that	Flux’s	members	have	 P(denial)	=	0.0909 	–	was	89.0%;	which	is	lower	than	the	90%
accuracy	that’s	been	advertised	in	the	past.	That	means	that	the	results	of	the	AEC’s	test	would

incorrectly	find	Flux	ineligible	11%	of	the	time.

Additionally,	Fig	7.2	and	7.3	show	that,	as	the	number	of	members	filtered	out	increases,	accuracy

drops	–	a	lot.

@Thresh 	in	these	titles	indicates	a	9.09%	denial	rate	(which	is	not	what	was	measured	during	Flux’s
recent	membership	test).	9.09%	=	150	/	1650.

+F__ 	indicates	that	the	number	in	place	of	 __ 	is	the	number	of	members	that	were	filtered	out
(e.g.,	duplicates,	deceased	members,	etc).

Fig	7.1:	Assuming	that	91.9%	of	the	members	(randomly	sampled	from	the	full	list)	on	Flux's	2021
membership	test	will	not	deny	membership	when	contacted	(1500/1650):	500,000	simulations	of

Flux's	membership	test	show	that	it	has	an	accuracy	of	89.0%	(i.e.,	false	negative	rate	of	11.0%),

which	is	less	than	the	AEC's	previously	advertised	90%	accuracy.

8.	Flux’s	Second	Membership	Test	(March	2022)

After	Flux’s	response	in	February	2022,	the	AEC	decided	of	its	own	accord	to	conduct	another

membership	test.	Flux	did	not	request	this.	In	fact,	it	makes	no	sense	for	Flux	to	request	this

because	we	were	primarily	concerned	with	the	inability	of	the	test	to	function	as	intended.	The	AEC

ignored	our	criticisms.	It	appears	that	the	AEC	does	not	care	about	reason,	or	logic,	or	statistical

arguments.

As	though	to	emphasize	the	fact	that	the	AEC’s	method	is	a	joke,	the	AEC’s	statement	of	reasons

[mirror],	authored	by	one	Ms	Reid,	says:

 	22.	The	membership	list	submitted	by	the	Party	on	13	February	2022	contained	4,680	names

of	individuals	that	the	Party	considers	to	be	current	members	(referred	to	as	‘members’	below).

As	a	delegate	of	the	Electoral	Commission,	I	instructed	that	the	top	1,650	names	be	tested	to

conform	with	the	AEC’s	membership	testing	parameters.	[…]

LEX3070 Released Document No. 3Released under the Freedom of Information Act 1982


--- Page 25 ---

The	membership	list	that	we	submitted	was	sorted	alphabetically	by	first	name.	“Gloria”	was	the	first

member	to	miss	out	on	the	chance	to	be	contacted.	Every	member	whose	first	name	came	later	than

hers,	alphabetically,	was	excluded.

The	Statement	of	“Reasons”

Let	me	grace	you	with	the	AEC’s	wisdom.

First,	consider	that	Flux	did	not	ask	for	another	membership	test,	and	argued	that	the	method	was

invalid;	the	list	of	4680	members	was	not	provided	for	the	purpose	of	a	membership	test,	it	was

provided	as	evidence	that	the	AEC’s	method	was	in	conflict	with	reality.

The	“supporting	statement”	comprises:

 	25.	I	have	considered	the	statement	lodged	by	the	Party	on	13	February	2022,	setting	out

reasons	why	the	Party	should	not	be	deregistered.

[Omitted:	quotes	of	Flux’s	February	2022	response]	

 	26.	I	reject	the	reasons	outlined	by	the	Party	in	its	statement	provided	on	13	February	2022

for	the	following	reasons.	

 	27.	The	Party	failed	membership	testing	for	exceeding	the	maximum	number	of	permitted

denials	according	to	the	ABS	methodology	used	by	the	AEC.	It	did	not	fail	membership	testing

due	to	having	an	insufficient	number	of	members	being	identified	on	the	electoral	roll.	

 	28.	The	Electoral	Act	defines	an	elector	as	someone	that	is	on	the	Commonwealth	Electoral

Roll.	Section	123	of	the	Electoral	Act	prescribes	that	an	eligible	political	party,	not	being	a

Parliamentary	party,	has	‘at	least	1,500	members’.	The	requirement	is	not	to	be	solely	‘an

elector’	but	to	be	a	member	of	the	party.	

 	29.	The	Party	challenges	the	validity	of	the	AEC’s	membership	testing	process.	This	process

has	been	developed	by	the	AEC	to	support	the	delegate’s	consideration	of	whether	a	party	has

sufficient	members.	It	is	based	on	sampling	methodology	designed	in	consultation	with	the	ABS

and	provides	a	valid	methodology	to	satisfy	a	delegate	of	a	party’s	membership.	The	Electoral

Commission	has	previously	concluded	that	the	methodology	‘was	appropriate	for	membership

1
testing,	including	because	it	was	rational,	fair	and	practical	in	all	the	circumstances.’ 	

 	30.	I	consider	that	the	membership	testing	results	outlined	above	provide	a	more	robust

method	for	ascertaining	whether	a	party	has	satisfied	the	requirements	of	the	Electoral	Act	than

a	statement	provided	by	the	party.	

 	31.	In	summary,	I	remain	satisfied	that	the	Party	does	not	have	at	least	1,500	members

based	on	the	outcomes	from	membership	testing	both	membership	lists	of	7	December	2021

and	13	February	2022.	

 	32.	Accordingly,	in	my	capacity	as	a	delegate	of	the	Electoral	Commission,	I	have
deregistered	VOTEFLUX.ORG	|	Upgrade	Democracy!	under	s	137(6)	of	the	Electoral	Act	and	the
particulars	of	the	Party	have	been	cancelled	from	the	Register	under	s	138	of	the	Electoral	Act.

Here	is	a	brief	analysis	of	the	insanity	of	the	above:

Point	25	is	dishonest	–	Flux’s	arguments	were	ignored.	Moreover,	the	exact	thing	that	we
criticized	was	the	first	thing	that	Ms	Reid	did.

Point	27	is	largely	irrelevant,	it	doesn’t	respond	to	anything	that	we	said.	It	also	contradicts	point
29,	which	starts:	“The	Party	challenges	the	validity	of	the	AEC’s	membership	testing	process.”	If

Ms	Reid	knows	this,	why	did	she	make	point	27?	That	the	AEC	method	failed	in	spite	of	Flux

LEX3070 Released Document No. 3Released under the Freedom of Information Act 1982


--- Page 26 ---

LEX3070 Released Document No. 3Released under the Freedom of Information Act 1982


--- Page 27 ---

Fig	8.1:	Despite	being	eligible	under	the	Electoral	Act,	Flux	could	never	have	passed	the	AEC's	test.

In	this	case,	the	AEC's	method	has	a	failure	rate	>	99.996%.	In	the	AEC's	words,	this	test	is	"rational,

fair	and	practical	in	all	the	circumstances".	What	a	joke.

Rigged.	There	isn’t	much	more	to	say.

9.	Feedback	Loops	Between	AEC	Policy	and	Party	Behavior

To	my	knowledge,	parties	typically	don’t	try	to	build	membership	to	many	thousands	of	members.

That’s	because	it’s	expensive,	time	consuming,	and	difficult	to	manage.	Most	importantly	–	there’s

no	point	when	it	comes	to	registration.

The	fact	that	the	AEC	has	imposed	this	flawed	method	for	years	means	that	non-parliamentary

parties’	common	practices	are	based	around	meeting	the	AEC’s	policies.	When	the	limit	was	550
(and	500	members	required),	there	literally	was	no	point	building	beyond	that	because	it	would	not

help	you	in	registering	or	maintaining	registration	–	it	was	largely	wasted	effort.

Additionally,	the	AEC’s	policies	have	entrenched	these	common	practices	which	enabled	the	political

elite	to	change	the	legislative	requirements	suddenly	and	dramatically	–	effectively	eliminate
competition.	The	AEC	is	complicit.

If	the	previous	status	quo	was	550	members	due	to	the	AEC	promulgating	a	culture	of	not	going
beyond	this,	and	then	parliament	decides	to	radically	change	the	limit	(there	is	no	reason	they	could
not	have	done	this	gradually	over,	say,	10	years	with	a	small	bump	each	year),	at	what	point	do	we
acknowledge	that	something	is	rotten?

The	AEC	is	on	record	about	why	it	imposes	a	limit	on	membership	lists	used	for	verification:

 	26.	In	respect	of	the	assertion	in	the	application	for	review	that	the	AEC	failed	to	test	the	lists

provided	by	the	Party	on	12	June	2017	(which	contained	650	members)	and	on	20	August	2017

(which	contained	739	members),	the	Commission	notes	that	the	‘Party	Registration	Guide’

requests	that	parties	provide	a	list	of	between	500	to	550	members.	This	is	considered	to	be	to

a	party’s	advantage,	by	minimizing	the	work	required	of	the	party	in	confirming	the	enrolment

LEX3070 Released Document No. 3Released under the Freedom of Information Act 1982

status	and	contact	details	of	additional	other	members.

https://www.aec.gov.au/Parties and Representatives/Party Registration/Registration Decisions/2018

/2018-commonwealth-of-australia-party-statement-of-reasons.pdf	(mirror)

Note:	this	case	cannot	be	analyzed	as	the	AEC	neglected	to	include	any	results	of	membership	tests.

How	about	the	AEC	stop	making	decisions	on	behalf	of	parties?	Especially	when	those	decisions	have

been	proven	(by	this	document)	to	have	systemically	disadvantaged	non-parliamentary	parties,	to

have	decreased	the	accuracy	of	the	AEC	membership	test,	to	be	based	on	falsehoods,	and,

ultimately,	to	be	a	reflection	of	a	condescension	and	hubris	that	has	no	place	running	a	democracy.

10.	Conclusion

With	the	AEC’s	existing	policies,	and	on	the	assumption	that	Flux	is	a	valid	party,	it	is	only

reasonable	to	conclude	that	Flux	will	find	it	increasingly	difficult	to	remain	registered	and	pass

registration	tests,	even	if	it	grows	in	membership.	This	applies	to	all	nonparliamentary	parties.	That

is	to	say:	the	process	has	a	predetermined	outcome,	and	is	an	empty	act	done	for	show.	It	is	rigged,

and	a	farce.

With	currently	measured	values	(based	on	AEC	results),	it	would	take	(on	average)	7	repeated	trials

for	Flux	to	have	1	successful	membership	test.	So	this	is	not	a	problem	that	can	be	solved	by

repeating	the	membership	test.

At	least	5	past	cases	have	been	identified	with	farcical	properties	–	they	are	suspected	farces	–	and

at	least	5	additional	cases	have	incomplete	information	but	may	be	farcical.

That	is:	in	these	cases	the	AEC’s	test	is	less	than	50%	accurate,	provided	that	those	parties	had

additional	members	(which	the	party	would	have	been	prevented	from	submitting	only	due	to	AEC

policy).	All	5	suspected	cases	required	less	than	15%	additional	members	–	i.e.,	the	membership	test
was	a	farce	for	all	cases	if	N	≥	630.	Note	that	all	5	cases	predate	the	September	2021	change	to

membership	requirements;	at	the	time	the	required	number	of	members	was	500.

It	has	thus	been	found	that	the	AEC’s	method	is	rigged	and	a	farce,	and	that	there	is

sufficient	evidence	to	back	this	up.

Note:	It	seems	likely	that	 max	denials	to	pass =3	for	the	 members	lodged =529	row	is	a	typo	–	it
should	probably	be	 4 ,	however,	in	all	source	documents	it	was	 3 .	In	the	2016	RPA	statement	of
reasons,	a	list	of	530	lead	to	38	contacts,	and	4	or	more	denials	was	a	fail	(so	 max	denials	to
pass =3).	This	typo	has	been	enforced.	(How	many	times?	Only	the	AEC	knows.)

According	to	the	sampling	methodology,	as	applied	to	a	list	of	530	names,	if	four	or	more	people
denied	membership	then	the	AEC	could	conclude	that	the	party	did	not	have	500	members.4

LEX3070 Released Document No. 3Released under the Freedom of Information Act 1982


--- Page 32 ---

[Footnote	4:]	According	to	the	ABS,	testing	a	sample	of	38	from	a	list	of	530	carried	with	it	a

2.72%	risk	that	the	AEC	could	end	up	accepting	a	party	that	had	only	400	members,	and	a

6.17%	risk	that	the	AEC	could	end	up	rejecting	a	party	that	had	500	members.

So	there	was	a	typo	at	some	point,	but	the	AEC	actually	used	the	typo	to	judge	party	membership.

So	a	party	with	between	529	and	536	members	during	this	period,	with	4	denials,	would	have	been

wrongly	denied	even	by	the	AEC’s	own	methodology.	Also,	the	footnote	values	don’t	match	the

previously	advertised	values	in	the	table…	is	that	just	because	it’s	calculated	for	530	instead	of	529?

Or	did	the	AEC	get	an	updated	table	in	2016	and	those	risk	values	changed?	If	they	did	change,	why?

(It’s	not	like	the	maths	changed,	right?)

The	2016	Australian	Democrats	statement	of	reasons	confirms	34	contacts	for	a	list	of	526	with

maximum	3	denials.

According	to	the	sampling	methodology,	as	applied	to	a	list	of	526	names,	if	four	or	more	people

3
denied	membership	then	the	AEC	could	conclude	that	the	party	did	not	have	500	members.

[Footnote	3:]	According	to	the	ABS,	testing	a	sample	of	34	from	a	list	of	526	carried	with	it	a

2.30%	risk	that	the	AEC	could	end	up	accepting	a	party	that	had	only	400	members,	and	a

8.53%	risk	that	the	AEC	could	end	up	rejecting	a	party	that	had	500	members.

Experimental	Eval

Note:	The	row	with	 members	lodged = 529	(corrected) 	corrects	the	erroneous	 max	denials	to	pass
from	 3 	to	 4 .	The	AEC	did	not	pick	up	on	this	error	for	at	least	4	years	(if	they	ever	did).

meet	requirements.

The	italicized	part	is	not	correct.	The	AEC's	method	is	much	better	than	this	--	it	only	fails	10%	to

20%	of	the	time	(the	above	quote	implies	that	the	method	fails	more	than	50%	of	the	time).	The

exact	false	negative	rate	depends	on	the	number	of	members	filtered	by	the	AEC,	similar	to	how

our	December	2021	list	of	1649	names	had	24	entries	filtered.	The	AEC's	method	is	more

reliable	when	fewer	names	are	filtered,	with	the	20%	false	negative	rate	corresponding	to	25

members	filtered	out.	(0	names	filtered	corresponds	to	a	10%	false	negative	rate.)

It	is	worth	pointing	out	that	there	are	similar	(though	slightly	more	extreme)	parameters	that	do

result	in	a	>50%	failure	rate	of	the	AEC's	method.	For	example	a	party	of	2000	members,	300	of

which	are	malicious,	and	15	names	filtered	has	a	failure	rate	of	50.4%.

Note,	there	are	some	other	errors	too,	like	the	method	mentioned	in	the	The	AEC’s	membership	test

Use	of	“confidence”	in	prior	versions

In	some	prior	versions	of	this	document,	the	term	“confidence”	was	used	instead	of	“accuracy”.	That

is:	it	was	used	to	describe	how	often	the	AEC’s	test	arrived	at	the	correct	result.
