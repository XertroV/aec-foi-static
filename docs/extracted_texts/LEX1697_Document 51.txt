Hi 

,

Thank you for coming back to us with this and for your detailed response.

We would very much appreciate meeting with you next week to discuss the scenarios further. If still
available, Thursday 28 October from 9:30am suits us and the relevant EIAT subset best.

Would you like me to circulate a Teams invite?

Kind regards,

Hi Anastasia

Not a problem, I know it can be tough to coordinate a number of diaries!

19 July at 12pm works for us, we can talk through the functionality of the tool and then have time for
Q&A at the end of the session.

Would you like to send the invite with your Microsoft Teams link? From our side it will be 

, myself, 

 and 

 (CC’d).

Many thanks

Hi 

Thanks for reaching out. Prior to scheduling a meeting to set up our portal account, can we please
have a separate chat about the portal’s functionality?

We have three different teams with interest in utilising the portal and to determine how we can best
accommodate this, it would be great to get some more information. E.g. can the AEC have more than
one mailbox with portal access? Hopeful to discuss further.

Kind regards,

Hi Anastasia

Great to be in touch. We’d be very happy to organise a call with you and team to talk through the 

 the process and timeline for getting set up.

I’ve noted some times below that will work for us, are you able to let me know which time suits you
and the team? I think 45 minutes to run through the tool and ask questions with suffice.

Fri 16 July – 12.00-12.45, 14.00-14.45
Mon 19 July – between 12 and 1400
Thurs 22 July – between 1400 and 1600

Many thanks

That’s terrific, thanks very much Anastasia. We’d be very happy to line up a time to talk through the
new channel with a member of the team who administers it.
I’ve copied in
all to discuss how to progress with this. She’s also been helping another regulator get onto the new
channel recently, so she’s the local expert in how it works.

, who I think you met the other day, who can help coordinate and find a time for us

 will be in touch shortly.

Cheers

Hi 
Thank you so much for the below, the attached and today’s additional mis/disinformation session, we
appreciate your ongoing engagement with us!
We are very keen to initiate the process to gain trusted access to your new portal, so would like to
either set up another meeting or discuss how we can otherwise progress this. We are particularly
interested in more information about the specific requirements for processing each request (which I
note is dependent on the selected reason). Depending on the timeline for setting up access to the
portal, and in being conscious that we would like to incorporate the details into the preparation
activities we are currently conducting, is it possible that we can get further information on this at your
earliest convenience?
Thank you again for your ongoing assistance
