Please review your recent decision to deregister flux party.

My name is 

, my current residence is 

I was linked to an article on the website of the flux party via one of their communication channels: 
https://www.voteflux.org/2022/04/20/wrongful-deregistration/ 

This article outlines reasons that the flux party believe their deregistration was unfair/unjust and I agree with their 
reasoning; that there is no reason not to poll the list of active memberships extensively to reach the firmest result. 
The flux party pose a plausible attempt at contesting the status quo and creating a better life for all Australians, so I 
ask that you please review your recent decision to deregister flux party. 

Thanks,
