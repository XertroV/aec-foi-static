The short URLs for each page are:  Thornlands 4164 – www.facebook.com/ThornlandsQLD Redland Hospital: Let’s fight for fair funding – www.facebook.com/RedlandHospital  We would suggest a reasonable approach here would be for you to contact Facebook, provide the above links and a list of dates and times for relevant posts to be retrieved. The other page – Redlands Institute is still live and all of the links are below: Redland Institute https://www.facebook.com/RInstit/photos/289654448560573 https://www.facebook.com/RInstit/photos/343065656552785 https://www.facebook.com/RInstit/photos/311386569720694 https://www.facebook.com/RInstit/photos/305907743601910 https://www.facebook.com/RInstit/posts/366292914230059 https://www.facebook.com/RInstit/posts/368025340723483 Assuming you already have but also a good idea to be taking screen shots of everything – including the page bio’s as they can change at any time. Let us know if you need anything else! Cheers,Bella  Isabella McCormick | Digital & Social Media Officer Australian Electoral CommissionT: (02) 6271 4704 X: 21086
