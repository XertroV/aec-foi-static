Thank you for checking with me. 

Additionally, I suggest the following edits:

If you want to discuss, let me know.

Hi 

Thanks for your email on 27 June 2024 regarding the PASA election E2024/78.

In relation to your allegation of breaches of s190 of the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Act 2009, if you have any evidence that union staff
campaigned during their work hours and not in the own personal time, please send it through and we will review the evidence.  You may also seek
you own legal advice regarding whether s190 was breached.

In regards to your concerns about the accuracy of the roll of voters, members who did not receive ballot papers could have contacted the AEC to
update their address details and be sent a replacement ballot kit to their new address. 
Unfortunately, it is too late for that now with the ballot closing on 4 July 2024.

In regards to voting, voters in this election can only vote once and cannot change their vote.

Kind regards
…………………….

On the FWC website Section 190 read this

 Organisation assisting particular candidates
It is an offence for an organisation or branch to allow its property to be used to help one candidate against another candidate in an election for office or other position (section 190).
This includes use of organisation or branch resources such as, but not limited to:

staff

facilities

work-issued vehicles, mobile phones and computers (even if private use is otherwise allowed).

My argument to what you’ve said, is it’s staff that are lobbying. Board members are paid by the Police Association. And they’ve created
emails that depict they are from PASA and explain they are on the board. 
Would you like to see the emails?

I also have another 2 queries.. 

The following is direct message to me from a member.. 

“I have been trying to get onto AEC and finally got someone this morning to help. 
My name was never on their list. 

So this example, 
papers. 

and has not received ballot

I also know of at least 20 known to me members that have not received their ballot papers to vote because the wrong address was
recorded either at AEC or PASA. 

What does this mean for this election? If some members weren’t even able to vote. 
Some may have called in, but if the election outcome is close in numbers, does that mean an appeal is available to other candidates that
don’t win. 

Is that possible or once it’s in, it’s in? 

I’m sorry for all the queries, but this is all new to me and some of it doesn’t seem fair to the process. 

Kindest Regards,

Dear 

Thank you for your email sent on 24 June 2024 regarding the election E2024/78.

It does not appear that s190 has been breached.

s190 of the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Act 2009 states:

FAIR WORK (REGISTERED ORGANISATIONS) ACT 2009 - SECT 190 : Organisation or branch must not assist one
candidate over another.

An organisation or branch commits an offence if it uses, or allows to be used, its property or resources to help a candidate
against another candidate in an election under this Part for an office or other position.
Penalty:  100 penalty units.

The organisations rule book can be found on the Fair Work Commission website under the tab ‘Registered Organisation’.

Thank you for bringing concerns to my attention.

Dear 
In addition to my last, the sending of these emails were sent by the recipients intending to be seen as PASA representatives,
otherwise they would’ve used their SAPol emails or other private email addresses.

They were sent to many people.

They are also supporting one candidate on the board over another on the board.

Thank you

No they are not official emails.  They are created by the member on Gmail and outlook.

But I’d argue that they appear to general members (who they were sent to - and lots of junior members) would
reasonably think/consider they are from PASA.

They are board members and known as board members.

Not many members know the official PASA email addresses.

The official email addresses ar

Where could I get a copy of those rules please?
