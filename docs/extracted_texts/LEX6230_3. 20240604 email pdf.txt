Hi 

, 

Happy Friday! 

Please find our queries below in regards to media recommendations: 

  Will there be a buy for the Brand phase? We created a 30” TVC last election 
  30” formality: As mentioned on the call we couldn’t fit the current script into this length. We could look at a 30” that raises awareness of the two ballot papers, and 

then use either one 30” or 2 x 15” on how to complete. 

o  We have not allowed for production costs to create a new TVC edit either. 

  Cinema formality – we would recommended keeping the 60” here given it is an option 
  Can we have some more clarity around the integrate partnerships and what assets we will need to provide/create for those? 

o 

If they are new, we haven’t allowed for those in the current estimates 

  Can we confirm what the horizontal META formats are or are they only for WeChat and Weibo? 

o  Also, are we reading the plan correctly and are we only going to be creating 15” social video assets? If so, what is the strategic thinking behind not 

producing 6” and 10”? 

o  To confirm as well, are we not providing social static assets for social? 
  Will we need two versions of the Formality OOH again – with and without the QR code? 
  Will UM be producing the live read pointers and the handicapped radio assets again? 

Also attached is the updated asset delivery timeline which we touched on in our last regroup. Let us know if you have any queries on that. 

Would also be great to start our WIPs from next week too if you are available?  

I believe we said Tuesday originally but would Wednesday 5th June between 9:30 and 12pm work for you then we can lock them in weekly ongoing. 

Cheers,
