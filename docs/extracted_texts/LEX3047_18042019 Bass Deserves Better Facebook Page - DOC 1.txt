Complaint Details

There is a social media page on Facebook named "Bass Deserves Better", posting 
and sharing union political messages. the page is run by a known senior union 
' (who is a Industrial Organiser at CPSU Tasmania) , as found 
member 
by scrolling through hundreds of posts I found that 
 was running it. The page is 
misleading as it being used to campaign against the Liberals and conservatives, on 
the premise that Labor is the only party to support. 

The issue is, the page is clearly being run by union members as away to reach 
voters in 'Bass', but has no 'authorised' message anywhere on the page. For the 
average voter they would see this page as being run by an apolitical group, but that 
is not the case.

Should this page be authorised by either Greene or the Union? As is the case with 
other union campaign pages. 

Link to page " https://www.facebook.com/BassDeservesBetter/ "

Expected Outcome

Should this page be authorised, or is it exempt, if so how come? reach out to the

group by telling them they are required to be authorised to stop misleading voters 
that they are apolitical.
