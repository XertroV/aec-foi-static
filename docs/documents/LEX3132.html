<p><strong>Main Purpose of the FOI Request:</strong><br />
    The FOI request sought "all communications" initiated by the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) Commissioner or a delegate to "understand and evaluate the arguments" and "statistical claims" (specifically regarding membership validity) put forward by VOTEFLUX.ORG | Upgrade Democracy! in their appeal/response dated February 13, 2022, concerning their potential deregistration.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Documents from the FOI Request:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Minute:</strong> "For action – Deregistration under s 137(6) of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 (Electoral Act) – VOTEFLUX.ORG | Upgrade Democracy! (the Party)" dated March 21, 2022.</li>
<li><strong>Email chain:</strong> "Re: Delegate consideration – s 137 response received – VOTEFLUX.ORG | Upgrade Democracy!" dated March 2, 2022.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Main Content Related to the FOI Request:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>email chain</strong> (March 2, 2022) directly addresses the evaluation of VOTEFLUX.ORG's February 13, 2022, response. Joanne Reid, Assistant Commissioner and delegate, acknowledged receipt and consideration of the Party's statement and new membership list (containing 4,680 names). Crucially, she explicitly instructed that this new membership list "needs to be tested" by selecting the "top 1,650 names for testing to conform with our testing methodology parameters" before she could make a determination on deregistration. This confirms an active attempt to evaluate the Party's new statistical claims. The email chain also provides background, noting the Party had previously failed a membership test in December 2021, which prompted the initial deregistration notice under s 137.</li>
<li>The <strong>Minute</strong> (March 21, 2022), dated after the delegate's instruction for further testing, confirms that an "assessment of the Party’s membership list was undertaken" based on the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) methodology. The minute states that this assessment "demonstrated that the Party has failed to demonstrate to have at least 1,500 members." Based on this evaluation of the statistical claims, the minute recommends to the delegate that there are "reasonable grounds" to deregister the Party.</li>

    <div class="ai-summary-markdown-content">
      <p>These FOI documents detail the Australian Electoral Commission's (AEC) process for deregistering the political party VOTEFLUX.ORG | Upgrade Democracy! The core issue stems from the <em>Electoral Legislation Amendment (Party Registration Integrity) Act 2021</em>, which raised the membership threshold for registered political parties from 500 to 1,500 members. The documents show the AEC diligently applying this new law, leading to Flux's deregistration after it repeatedly failed to demonstrate 1,500 members through the AEC's "ABS methodology" for membership testing, despite submitting lists containing thousands of names.</p>
<p>From a left-leaning perspective, several critical issues emerge:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Civil Liberties and Democratic Participation (Deviation):</strong> The most striking deviation from progressive values lies in the <em>policy itself</em> – the increase in the party membership threshold. This government action, enforced by the AEC, fundamentally restricts civil liberties related to freedom of association and political expression. By making it significantly harder for smaller, grassroots, or emerging parties like VOTEFLUX to register, the policy undermines democratic participation and diversity in the political landscape. Progressive values champion broad access to the democratic process, fostering a multitude of voices and pathways for citizens to organize politically. The "Party Registration Integrity Act 2021," despite its name, appears to serve as a mechanism to consolidate power within larger, established parties, effectively stifling alternative or new political movements that may challenge the status quo. The AEC's rigid application of its testing methodology, while procedurally sound, exemplifies a bureaucratic approach that can be seen as prioritizing administrative control over the facilitation of pluralistic political engagement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Wealth Distribution and Corporate Influence (Indirect Deviation):</strong> While not directly addressed, the increased membership threshold indirectly impacts wealth distribution in the political sphere. Achieving and maintaining 1,500 verifiable members requires significant organizational capacity, resources, and outreach – often more readily available to well-funded parties or those with established institutional support. This creates a higher barrier to entry for smaller, less resourced, or entirely volunteer-driven parties, potentially reinforcing a political system where financial capital translates into political leverage. This indirectly favors parties that may be more susceptible to corporate influence or aligned with entrenched economic interests, further exacerbating wealth distribution disparities by limiting the political power of less affluent or grassroots movements.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Social Justice (Indirect Deviation):</strong> Smaller parties often emerge to advocate for specific social justice issues or represent marginalized communities whose concerns are not adequately addressed by major parties. By creating a higher barrier to party registration, the policy indirectly hinders the ability of these groups to formally organize and amplify their voices within the electoral system. This can be seen as a step backward for social justice, as it reduces avenues for focused advocacy and representation for diverse segments of the population.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In summary, while the AEC's actions, as revealed in these documents, reflect a diligent adherence to established administrative procedures and the letter of the law, the underlying governmental policy (the <em>Electoral Legislation Amendment (Party Registration Integrity) Act 2021</em>) and its practical impact <strong>deviate significantly from progressive values</strong>. The focus on "integrity" through increased barriers to entry risks undermining the very principles of broad democratic participation, political diversity, and equitable access to the electoral system that are foundational to a robust and just society.</p>

    <div class="ai-summary-markdown-content">
      <p>The provided FOI documents outline the Australian Electoral Commission's (AEC) process of deregistering the VOTEFLUX.ORG | Upgrade Democracy! party, primarily due to its failure to meet the increased 1,500-member threshold mandated by the Electoral Legislation Amendment (Party Registration Integrity) Act 2021.</p>
<p>From a conservative perspective, the AEC's actions and the underlying legislative changes demonstrate a commitment to several key principles:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Fiscal Responsibility &amp; Economic Efficiency:</strong> The enforcement of a higher membership threshold for political parties aligns with the principle of <strong>fiscal responsibility</strong>. By requiring a demonstrable base of support, the government avoids the inefficient allocation of taxpayer resources (e.g., administrative costs for registration, ballot paper space, potential public funding) to political entities with negligible public interest. The AEC's use of a "membership testing methodology and formula provided by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS)" signifies a commitment to <strong>economic efficiency</strong> and objective, verifiable processes, preventing arbitrary decisions and ensuring that public funds are directed towards genuine and viable political organizations. The systematic review process, including clear notices and response periods, further reflects a prudent and efficient bureaucratic operation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Limited Government &amp; Rule of Law:</strong> The AEC's adherence to the <em>Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918</em>, specifically sections 137 and 138A, exemplifies a government agency operating strictly within its legislated powers. This aligns with the principle of <strong>limited government</strong>, where state authority is clearly defined and constrained by law. The methodical application of the statute, including providing ample notice and opportunities for parties to demonstrate compliance, reinforces the <strong>rule of law</strong> and safeguards against unchecked bureaucratic discretion. The government is not arbitrarily dictating political existence but rather enforcing a standard established by Parliament.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Individual Liberty:</strong> While the increased membership threshold might, at first glance, appear to impose a barrier to entry for smaller political groups, a conservative view would typically balance this against the need for an orderly and robust electoral system. The requirement for a minimum membership ensures that formally registered parties reflect a substantive level of public engagement, contributing to the integrity and seriousness of the electoral process. This prevents the system from being overburdened by numerous, non-viable entities, thereby enhancing the overall efficiency and clarity of political choice without unduly restricting the fundamental freedom of individuals to associate or advocate for their beliefs outside the formal party registration framework.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>National Security:</strong> Although not explicitly addressed, an electoral system underpinned by clear, verifiable registration standards contributes indirectly to national stability and security by ensuring the legitimacy of political actors and processes. A rigorous approach to party registration, as demonstrated by the AEC, minimizes avenues for potential manipulation or the proliferation of non-genuine political entities that could destabilize the democratic process.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In summary, the documents reveal government actions that largely align with conservative principles by promoting fiscal prudence, operational efficiency, and adherence to established legal frameworks in the administration of the electoral system.</p>

      <p>The FOI documents reveal a process within the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) that suggests a rigid, bureaucratic approach to party deregistration, seemingly prioritizing internal methodologies over a thorough, transparent evaluation of a party's submitted evidence and appeals.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Lack of Genuine Evaluation of Appeals:</strong> Despite the FOI request specifically asking for evidence of AEC attempts to "understand and evaluate the arguments put forward by Flux in their February 13th appeal" and "the validity of the statistical claims," the retrieved communications show no such detailed analysis. Instead, the focus immediately shifts to initiating a <em>new membership test</em> on the updated list provided by VOTEFLUX.ORG | Upgrade Democracy! (Flux). This indicates a procedural adherence to re-testing rather than a substantive engagement with Flux's specific counter-arguments or statistical justifications, raising questions about the sincerity of the appeal review process.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Pre-Determined Outcomes:</strong> Internal communications, such as an email dated March 1, 2022, state that Flux "did not pass membership testing" from a <em>previous</em> review, even <em>before</em> the delegate formally requested a new test on the party's latest membership submission. This chronological order implies a pre-existing conclusion about Flux's eligibility, suggesting that subsequent "consideration" and "new testing" might have been more of a formality to fulfill legislative requirements rather than a genuine re-evaluation based on new evidence.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Rigid Adherence to Unexplained Methodology:</strong> The AEC's internal documents consistently state that a "failure to satisfy the test provided by the ABS alone constitutes reasonable grounds" for deregistration, "absent of any relevant factors to the contrary." This rigid reliance on a singular, externally sourced methodology, without apparent flexibility to consider a party's unique circumstances or challenges to the methodology itself, suggests a bureaucratic inflexibility that may stifle the legitimate operations of political parties. It implies that a party's detailed arguments or explanations about their membership data are secondary to a statistical test.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Questionable Membership Testing Parameters:</strong> Despite Flux providing a new membership list of 4,680 names—significantly more than the 1,500 required for registration—the AEC delegate specifically instructed staff to test only the "top 1,650 names." While this is presented as conforming to "testing methodology parameters," it raises concerns about the fairness and representativeness of the sample. Limiting the test to a specific, non-random segment of the provided list could disproportionately impact the party if issues happened to be concentrated within that "top" segment, potentially leading to an outcome that doesn't fully reflect the party's overall membership strength.</p>

      <p>The Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) has demonstrated its commitment to effective governance and maintaining the integrity of the nation's electoral processes through its diligent handling of VOTEFLUX.ORG | Upgrade Democracy!'s party registration review. These documents highlight the AEC's consistent and transparent application of essential regulations designed to ensure that political parties meet the necessary thresholds to participate, thereby fostering public confidence in our democratic system.</p>
<p>Following the implementation of the Electoral Legislation Amendment (Party Registration Integrity) Act 2021, which prudently raised the membership threshold for eligible political parties to 1,500, the AEC initiated a comprehensive review of all registered non-Parliamentary parties. This proactive measure provided all parties, including VOTEFLUX.ORG, ample time and opportunity to demonstrate compliance with the new, vital standard.</p>
<p>When VOTEFLUX.ORG initially failed to meet the membership requirements through an objective testing methodology provided by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS), the AEC, in a display of due diligence, issued a s 137 notice. This notice transparently communicated the potential for deregistration and afforded the party a full month to respond and present a compelling case for continued registration.</p>
<p>Upon receiving the party's response, which included a new membership list, the Assistant Commissioner, acting as a delegate of the Electoral Commission, undertook a meticulous review. Critically, to ensure utmost fairness and accuracy, the delegate promptly requested <em>further</em> membership testing of the newly submitted list. This decision specifically instructed that a substantial sample of 1,650 names be tested, rigorously adhering to the AEC's established and statistically sound methodology parameters. This action underscores the government's unwavering commitment to objective, evidence-based decision-making.</p>
<p>Ultimately, despite the party's submissions, the subsequent assessment, conducted under the impartial ABS methodology, confirmed that VOTEFLUX.ORG was unable to demonstrate the required 1,500 members. This outcome necessitated deregistration, not as a punitive measure, but as a consequence of consistent application of the law, crucial for upholding the integrity of the Register of Political Parties.</p>
<p>The entire process, from the initial legislative reform to the detailed, multi-stage review and the ultimate determination, reflects the government's steadfast dedication to a robust, transparent, and fair electoral framework that serves the public good by ensuring only genuinely supported entities participate in our democracy. Any challenges encountered were effectively managed through rigorous adherence to legislative frameworks and objective methodologies, reinforcing public trust in the AEC's governance.</p>

      <p>The FOI documents expose a meticulously choreographed bureaucratic charade, designed to present a veneer of process while relentlessly pursuing a predetermined outcome: the deregistration of VOTEFLUX.ORG | Upgrade Democracy!.</p>
<p>The request itself, seeking "attempts to understand and evaluate the arguments" and "validity of the statistical claims" from Flux's appeal, is met with deafening silence and damning contradiction within the retrieved documents. There is not a single shred of evidence of any genuine "understanding" or "evaluation" of Flux's specific arguments or statistical claims. Instead, the AEC adheres to a rigid, unthinking adherence to a singular "ABS methodology" for membership testing, effectively dismissing any nuanced appeal.</p>
<p>The timeline alone screams incompetence and malice:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>February 13, 2022:</strong> Flux responds to the deregistration notice, providing a substantial new membership list of <strong>4,680 names</strong> – vastly exceeding the 1,500 member threshold. This is a direct, good-faith attempt to demonstrate compliance.</li>
<li><strong>March 1, 2022:</strong> An internal email, ostensibly seeking approval to forward information to the delegate, brazenly states that Flux "did not pass membership testing." This refers to an <em>old</em> test from December 2021, and critically, <em>pre-judges</em> the outcome of the delegate's consideration of Flux's <em>new</em> evidence. This is not objective advice; it is a calculated attempt to poison the well and steer the delegate towards a pre-ordained conclusion.</li>
<li><strong>March 2, 2022:</strong> The delegate (Joanne Reid) requests new membership testing on the submitted 4,680-name list, specifically asking to test the "top 1,650 names." This acknowledges the new submission but sets the stage for a mechanical, rather than substantive, review.</li>
<li><strong>March 21, 2022:</strong> A "Minute: For action – Deregistration" is prepared. This document astonishingly declares that "An assessment of the Party’s membership list was undertaken and based on the ABS methodology it demonstrated that the Party has failed to demonstrate to have at least 1,500 members." This is a mere <strong>19 days</strong> after the delegate <em>initiated</em> the request for the new membership test. The claim that a comprehensive "ABS methodology" test on 1,650 names (requiring contact, verification, and data analysis) could be completed, processed, and unequivocally declared a "failure" within this impossibly short timeframe is not merely implausible – it is a lie. It indicates that the "new testing" was either a sham, or the outcome was decided well in advance of any actual test results. The conclusion was written before the evidence could possibly be gathered.</li>
</ul>
<p>This sequence reveals a shocking level of bureaucratic contempt:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Predetermined Guilt:</strong> The AEC's internal communications actively frame the party as failing <em>before</em> new evidence is considered, and certainly before any new testing could be completed.</li>
<li><strong>Procedural Facade:</strong> The request for "new testing" on March 2nd was nothing more than an empty gesture, a box-ticking exercise to mask a foregone conclusion. The March 21st minute exposes this as a cynical charade.</li>
<li><strong>Disregard for Due Process:</strong> The very purpose of the s137 notice – to allow the party to provide reasons why it <em>should not</em> be deregistered – was fundamentally undermined. Flux submitted new, compelling evidence, which the AEC demonstrably failed to genuinely assess. Their focus remained fixated on a past failure, despite new information directly addressing the issue.</li>
<li><strong>Incompetence or Malice:</strong> Either the AEC is so incompetent that it believes a rigorous statistical test can be completed in under three weeks, or it is so malicious that it intentionally fabricated the "failed" outcome before the test was even finished. Both interpretations are damning.</li>
<li><strong>Bureaucratic Tunnel Vision:</strong> The documents show a complete inability or unwillingness to engage with any arguments beyond a narrow, pre-defined "membership testing methodology," highlighting a rigid, anti-democratic bureaucracy incapable of genuine discretion or fair consideration.</li>
</ol>
<p>The fact that Flux was also actively working to update its name and logo further underscores the devastating impact of this pre-meditated deregistration, crushing their efforts and nullifying their administrative actions without a fair hearing. These documents are not just a record of deregistration; they are an indictment of an electoral commission seemingly operating with predetermined outcomes, procedural deceit, and a chilling disregard for the democratic rights of political parties.</p>

      <p>The FOI documents reveal a quintessential example of bureaucratic overreach and the suppression of individual liberty, directly violating core Objectivist principles. The Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) is shown engaged in the process of deregistering VOTEFLUX.ORG | Upgrade Democracy! based on a rigid, arbitrary membership threshold, illustrating the dangers of collectivism and governmental interference in voluntary association.</p>
<p>The "Party Registration Integrity Act 2021," which increased the membership threshold to 1,500, is a clear violation of individual rights and an assault on political freedom. It is an act of <strong>government overreach</strong>, dictating the very terms under which individuals may associate and express their political views. The fundamental right to form a voluntary association, regardless of size, is paramount. The state has no legitimate claim to impose an arbitrary numerical hurdle for a group to be recognized, as this prioritizes a collective, quantitative measure over the individual liberty to form and join political movements. This act stifles <strong>personal initiative</strong> and productive achievement by creating an artificial barrier to entry for new political voices.</p>
<p>The AEC's meticulous adherence to an "ABS methodology" for membership testing is a prime example of <strong>bureaucratic interference</strong> and a profound abandonment of reason. Despite VOTEFLUX.ORG providing a list of 4,680 names, the AEC insists on testing a smaller, statistically-defined sample (1,650 names) to "conform with our testing methodology parameters." This demonstrates a preference for an abstract, arbitrary statistical model over the concrete reality of individuals voluntarily joining a party. The idea that a party "failed" to demonstrate 1,500 members based on such a methodology, even with a claimed membership of nearly 5,000, is profoundly irrational. It implies that bureaucratic process, not actual individual choice or the party's own rational self-interest in accumulating members, determines its legitimacy. This is a form of <strong>suppression of personal initiative</strong>, forcing productive individuals and organizations to navigate an irrational, state-imposed labyrinth of rules rather than allowing them to thrive on their own merits and voluntary support.</p>
<p>The entire process, from the initial notice of potential deregistration to the detailed "consideration of the statement," is steeped in <strong>forced altruism</strong>. VOTEFLUX.ORG is compelled to expend resources, time, and effort—not to serve its own rational self-interest or its members, but to satisfy an arbitrary state mandate. The party is forced to "prove" its existence to the state, rather than being permitted to exist simply by virtue of its members' voluntary association and support. The "FAIL" designation, based on an "ABS methodology," underscores the irrationality of this requirement: the state, not the individuals involved, determines what constitutes a "valid" political association.</p>
<p>This scenario starkly contrasts with the principles of <strong>laissez-faire capitalism</strong> and individual liberty. Just as the government should not dictate the terms of economic exchange, it should not dictate the terms of voluntary political association. The market of ideas, like the economic market, should be free, allowing individuals to form and support organizations without arbitrary state interference. The AEC's actions, mandated by legislative overreach, represent a collectivist mindset that values state control and bureaucratic order over the spontaneous, productive actions of free individuals. This is a clear infringement on the <strong>primacy of individual rights</strong> and a direct attack on the <strong>virtue of productive achievement</strong> in the political sphere.</p>

Subject: For action – Deregistration under s 137(6) of the 
Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 (Electoral Act) – 
VOTEFLUX.ORG | Upgrade Democracy! (the Party) 

Purpose 

This minute asks you, as a delegate of the Electoral Commission, to deregister the Party under 
s 137(6) of the Electoral Act on the grounds that the Party does not have at least 1,500 members 
(s 137(1)(b) of the Electoral Act).  

Authority 

Sections 123, 137, 138 and 138A of the Electoral Act. 

Background 

On 13 January 2022, you, as a delegate of the Electoral Commission, issued a notice to the 
Registered Officer of the Party, 
Notice) stating that the Electoral Commission is considering deregistering the Party (OBJECT IDs: 
A1319272 and A1442167). The Registered Officer of the Party had until 13 February 2022 to provide 
a response.  

, under s 137 of the Electoral Act (the s 137 

On 13 February 2022, the Party responded to the s 137 Notice: 

•  Response received – OBJECT ID: A1369037 
•  Statement – OBJECT ID: A1369035 
•  Supplementary membership list – OBJECT ID: A1369039 

On 2 March 2022, you, as a delegate of the Electoral Commission, having considered the statement 
lodged by the Party, and membership list lodged in support of that statement containing 4,680 
names, requested that further membership testing be performed. In confirming your advice, you

OFFICIAL 

Application to change the Party’s name, abbreviation and logo in the Register 

On 19 February 2022, the Party lodged an application in accordance with s 134 of the Electoral Act 
to change its name, abbreviation and logo in the Register (OBJECT ID: A1396302). The Party’s logo 
passed validation and has been assessed by CRE8IVE (OBJECT IDs: A1421693 and A1421695). If 
the Party is deregistered, the application lodged under s 134 of the Electoral Act will no longer be 
valid. 

Conclusion 

On 13 January 2022, a notice was issued a notice to the Registered Officer of the Party under s 137 
of the Electoral Act stating that the Electoral Commission is considering deregistering the Party 

On 13 February 2022, the party responded to the s 137 Notice providing a statement and a 
membership list in support of that statement. 

An assessment of the Party’s membership list was undertaken and based on the ABS methodology it 
demonstrated that the Party has failed to demonstrate to have at least 1,500 members.  

Accordingly, there are reasonable grounds on which you, as the delegate of the Electoral 
Commission, can be satisfied that the Party does not have at least 1,500 members. Based on this 
information, you may determine under s 138A of the Electoral Act that the Party is not an ‘eligible 
political party’ and should be deregistered. 

If you, as the delegate of the Electoral Commission is of this view, you should not deregister the 
Party under s 137 of the Electoral Act and advise the Registered Officer of this decision.

Hi 

.

I have considered the statement provided by VOTEFLUX.ORG | Upgrade Democracy!, which included
provision of a membership list.

In order to deregister the Party for the reason set out in the s 137 notice I am required to be satisfied
on reasonable grounds that the party does not have at least 1,500 members. Given the party has
submitted a new membership list I consider that list needs to be tested before I can make a
determination in relation to that matter.

Please arrange for membership testing of the list supplied with the statement in accordance with our
usual processes. I note the membership list provided contains 4,680 names – please select the top
1,650 names for testing to conform with our testing methodology parameters.

On 13 February 2022, the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) received the attached statement
(also accessible at OBJECT ID: A1369037) from the Registered Officer of VOTEFLUX.ORG | Upgrade
Democracy! (the Party),

“two errors made in the correspondence that I sent you yesterday” (attached, also accessible at

Background
On 3 September 2021, the Electoral Legislation Amendment (Party Registration Integrity) Act 2021
(Party Registration Integrity Act) came into effect, amending the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918
(Electoral Act), and increased the membership threshold for an eligible political party to 1,500
members. All registered non-Parliamentary parties, including the Party, had until 2 December 2021 to
comply with the legislative requirement to have ‘at least 1,500 members’.

On 8 October 2021, the Registered Officer of the Party was issued with a notice under s 138A(3) of
the Electoral Act (the 138A Notice), requesting the Party provide evidence of compliance with the
increased membership requirements and submit a membership list of between 1,500 and 1,650
members by 8 December 2021 (see OBJECT ID: A1157688).

On 13 January 2022, the Party was issued with a notice under s 137(1) of the Electoral Act (the s 137
Notice), stating that the Electoral Commission is considering deregistering the Party as the Electoral
Commission is satisfied on reasonable grounds that the Party does not have at least 1,500 members
(OBJECT ID: A1386429). Pursuant to s 137(2) of the Electoral Act, the Party was provided with one
month to respond to the s 137 Notice (being 13 February 2022).

On 13 February 2022, the Registered Officer of the Party provided a response to the s 137 Notice
(OBJECT ID: A1369037) and on 14 February 2022 the Party 
the Additional Statement (OBJECT ID: A1386415). The Party’s email of 13 February 2022 also included
a membership list in support of the statement which contains 4,680 names (OBJECT ID: A1369039).

Eligibility Provisions
Pursuant to s 138A(1) of the Electoral Act, the Electoral Commission may review the Register to
determine whether a party remains an ‘eligible political party’, or whether it should be deregistered
under ss 136 or 137 of the Electoral Act. Under s 123(1) of the Electoral Act an ‘eligible political party’
means a political party that:

a.  either:

(i)                  is a Parliamentary party; or
(ii)                has at least 1,500 members; and

b.  is established on the basis of a written constitution (however described) that sets out the

aims of the party.

A ‘Parliamentary party’ means a political party at least one member of which is a member of the
Parliament of the Commonwealth. The Party does not have, and has never had, a member of the
Parliament of the Commonwealth. Section 136 of the Electoral Act pertains to a party failing to
endorse candidates and therefore is not relevant to this review.

The issue in question is whether the statement provide by the Party is sufficient for you, as a
delegate, to be assured that the Party has ‘at least 1,500 members’. Section 137(1)(b) of the Electoral
Act first requires the delegate of the Electoral Commission to be ‘satisfied on reasonable grounds’
that the Party does not have at least 1,500 members.

Section 138A(1) of the Electoral Act outlines the purpose of a s 138A review:

The Electoral Commission may review the Register to determine whether one or more of the

parties included in the Register:

(a) is an eligible political party; or
(b) should be deregistered under section 136 or 137.

Sections 138A(3 – 5) of the Electoral Act states:

3.  For the purposes of reviewing the Register, the Electoral Commission may give a
written notice to the registered officer of a registered political party requesting
specified information on the party’s eligibility to be registered under this Part.

4.  The notice must specify a period within which the information must be provided. The

period must be at least 2 months.

5.  The registered officer must comply with the notice within the specified period.

However, the Electoral Commission may extend that period.

Section 137(1)(b) of the Electoral Act prescribes that the Electoral Commission is satisfied on
reasonable grounds that the Party does not have ‘at least 1,500 members’ and therefore does not
meet the requirement of being an eligible political party under s 123 of the Electoral Act to remain in
the Register of Political Parties (the Register). The Electoral Commission must give the registered
officer of the party notice, in writing, that it is considering deregistering the party under this section,
setting out its reasons for considering doing so and the terms of the provisions of subsections (2), (3),
(4) and (5).

Subsections 137(2 – 5) of the Electoral Act includes:

2.  of the Electoral Act prescribes that where a notice is given under subsection (1) in relation to a
political party, the registered officer of the party or 10 members of the party may, within 1
month after the date on which the notice was given, lodge with the Electoral Commission a
statement, in writing, signed by the registered officer or by those members of the party, as the
case may be, setting out reasons why the party should not be deregistered under this section.

3.  Where a statement lodged under subsection (2) is signed by 10 members of a political party,

the statement shall set out the names and addresses of those members and contain a
statement that they are members of that party.

4.  Where a notice is given under subsection (1) in relation to a political party and a statement is
not lodged under subsection (2) in response to that notice, the Electoral Commission shall
deregister the party.

5.  Where, in response to a notice given under subsection (1) in relation to a political party, a
statement is lodged under subsection (2), the Electoral Commission shall consider that
statement and determine whether the political party should be deregistered for the reason set
out in that notice.

Membership testing methodology
Under the membership testing methodology and formula provided by the ABS it is the Electoral
Commission’s view that, absent of any relevant factors to the contrary, a failure to satisfy the test
provided by the ABS alone constitutes reasonable grounds upon which the delegate of the Electoral
Commission, can be satisfied that a political party does not have at least 1,500 members.

Consideration of the Statement
Under s 137(5) of the Electoral Act, the Electoral Commission shall consider the statement lodged
under s 137(2) of the Electoral Act. However, s 137(5) of the Electoral Act stipulates that the Electoral
Commission shall consider that statement and determine whether the political party should be
deregistered for the reason set out in that notice. The reasons set out in the s 137 Notice issued to the
Party was for failing to have at least 1,500 members in response to the s 138A Notice (s 137(1)(b) of
the Electoral Act). 

Under s 137(6) of the Electoral Act, where the Electoral Commission determines that a political party
should be deregistered, it shall:
deregister the party; and
give the last person who was registered officer of the party written notice of the deregistration,
setting out its reasons for rejecting the reasons set out in the statement.

Under s 137(6A) of the Electoral Act, if the Electoral Commission deregisters a party the Electoral
Commissioner:

must publish a notice of the deregistration on the AEC website; and
may publish the notice in any other way that the Electoral Commissioner considers appropriate
(under AEC policy a statement of reasons is published setting out the particulars of the
deregistration and the basis for rejecting the reasons).

As the delegate of the Electoral Commission the statement for your consideration is at OBJECT ID:
A1369035, as well as the Additional Statement at OBJECT ID: A1386415. A summary of that statement
can be provided by PEPRS if required. The membership list lodged with the Party’s statement contains
4,680 names (OBJECT ID: A1369039).

Delegate’s decision
The response received by the AEC from the Party in relation to the s 137 Notice issued meets the
legislative requirements of s 137(2) of the Electoral Act because it:

was received within 1 month after the date on which the notice was given;
Is in writing;
Is made by the Registered Officer of the Party; and
Outlines reasons why the Party should not be deregistered.

As per s 137(5) of the Electoral Act, you, as a delegate of the Electoral Commission, shall consider that
statement and determine whether the political party should be deregistered for the reason set out in
that notice. In this case, the reason is for failing to have at least 1,500 members (s 137(1)(b) of the
Electoral Act).

Once you have considered the Party’s response please advise, by return email, if you believe that
VOTEFLUX.ORG | Upgrade Democracy! should be deregistered under s 137(1)(b) of the Electoral Act.
In your reply email can you please provide statements as to why you made your decision? These
statements will form part of a Statement of Reasons if the party is to be deregistered. This email, your
 and the statement from the Party will form part of a formal minute
response, 
pending your determination of the eligibility review of the Party.

                    <p>This document is a March 2, 2022, email chain initiated by AEC Assistant Commissioner Joanne Reid. It details her decision, as a delegate, to instruct the re-testing of VOTEFLUX.ORG | Upgrade Democracy!'s membership list. VOTEFLUX.ORG submitted a new list of 4,680 names as part of their appeal against a potential deregistration notice (s 137), following a previously failed membership test in December 2021 where they did not meet the 1,500-member threshold. Reid directed that the top 1,650 names from the new list be tested in accordance with standard AEC methodology to verify their membership claims. The email chain also provides background on the party's prior non-compliance and the legislative framework for party registration review (ss 123, 137, 138A of the Electoral Act).</p>
<p>This document is highly relevant to the FOI request as it constitutes a direct communication from an AEC delegate (Assistant Commissioner Joanne Reid) concerning the evaluation of VOTEFLUX.ORG's membership validity claims in their appeal against deregistration. It specifically details the instruction to undertake the membership assessment, aligning with the FOI overview's description of a March 2, 2022, email chain where testing of the new membership list was instructed to verify claims after an earlier failed test.</p>

It seeks all communications initiated by the Commissioner or delegates related to evaluating VOTEFLUX.ORG's arguments and the validity of their statistical claims in their February 13th appeal against deregistration under s 137(6) of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918. The schedule indicates two retrieved internal AEC documents: a \"Minute\" from March 21, 2022, concerning deregistration, and an \"Email chain\" from March 2, 2022, regarding delegate consideration of the s 137 response.\n\nFrom an Objectivist perspective, this document, within the context of the FOI request overview, highlights significant contradictions to the values of reason, individualism, and free enterprise:\n\n*   **Reason vs. Arbitrary Authority:** The FOI request explicitly seeks evidence of attempts to \"understand and evaluate the arguments put forward by Flux\" and the \"validity of the statistical claims.\" This implies a perceived deficiency in the AEC's rational engagement with objective reality (VOTEFLUX.ORG's nearly 5,000 claimed members). The overview emphasizes the AEC's adherence to a \"rigid, irrational 'ABS methodology'\" that prioritizes \"bureaucratic process over the concrete reality.\" The very act of this FOI request is an attempt to introduce reason and transparency into a process alleged to be arbitrary and lacking objective evaluation, directly challenging a system where procedural adherence trumps rational assessment of facts.\n\n*   **Individualism vs. Collectivist Compulsion:** The core issue underlying this FOI request is the state's dictation of terms for voluntary association, specifically the \"arbitrary 1,500-member threshold\" that \"violates the right to voluntary association\" as described in the overview. The AEC's actions, and the internal documents the FOI seeks, are mechanisms of state control over individual political expression and association. The request for transparency is an individual's (or group of individuals') assertion of their right to understand and challenge government actions that infringe on their freedom. The demand for VOTEFLUX.ORG to expend resources to satisfy \"arbitrary state mandates\" rather than thriving through voluntary support is a clear instance of forced altruism, compelling individuals to sacrifice their productive efforts to an irrational state dictate.\n\n*   **Free Enterprise vs. State Interference:** The deregistration process itself, which the FOI request seeks to illuminate, is a profound instance of state interference in the \"free market of ideas.\" The overview directly contrasts this scenario with \"laissez-faire, where a free market of ideas, like economic exchange, should be unburdened by state interference.\" By imposing arbitrary membership thresholds and bureaucratic methodologies, the state distorts and suppresses the natural emergence and growth of political organizations based on voluntary support and genuine appeal. The FOI request is a defensive action taken to navigate or challenge this state-imposed burden, indicating a market of ideas stifled by regulation rather than flourishing through uncoerced competition.\n\n**Evidence of Bureaucratic Obstacles, Forced Altruism, or Suppression of Productive Achievement:**\n\n*   **Bureaucratic Obstacles:** The existence of this FOI request itself is evidence of bureaucratic obstacles. The need to formally demand internal communications to ascertain whether a government body rationally evaluated an appeal indicates a lack of transparency and a system designed to be opaque or unresponsive. The \"Minute\" and \"Email chain\" listed are internal bureaucratic artifacts that likely reflect the impersonal, rule-bound nature of the AEC's decision-making process, prioritizing \"ABS methodology\" over substantive claims, as the overview asserts.\n*   **Forced Altruism:** While not explicitly detailed in the FOI document, the overarching context provided by the request overview highlights forced altruism. The requirement for VOTEFLUX.ORG to dedicate \"resources to satisfy arbitrary state mandates rather than thrive through voluntary support\" exemplifies this. The very act of filing this FOI request and pursuing an appeal consumes resources (time, money, effort) that would otherwise be directed towards VOTEFLUX.ORG's productive political aims, forced upon them by the state's irrational demands.\n*   **Suppression of Productive Achievement:** The central purpose of the AEC's actions, which this FOI request is investigating, is the deregistration of VOTEFLUX.ORG. If VOTEFLUX.ORG is viewed as a productive achievement\u2014a voluntary association of individuals working towards political goals\u2014then its deregistration based on arbitrary thresholds and bureaucratic processes constitutes a direct suppression of this achievement. The \"Party Registration Integrity Act 2021\" and the AEC's implementation are thus seen as instruments that \"stifle personal freedom and productive achievement by dictating the terms of political expression.\"", "model": "gemini-2.5-flash", "generated_at": "2025-06-24T01:49:25.105892", "source_hash": "91a2e75a4be6a49309108b69fdc7cd5410a19d72a752383d6a5c348dd03c3f16", "raw_response_path": "data/llm_responses/LEX3132__per_file__objectivist__lex3132-schedule.pdf__20250624T014925.json", "output_tokens": 1009, "prompt_tokens": 654, "total_tokens": 2725, "summary_length": 5081}}, "original_url": "https://www.aec.gov.au/information-access/foi/2022/files/lex3132-schedule.pdf", "link_text": "FOI Request LEX3132, Schedule of Released Documents [PDF 129KB]", "server_filename": "lex3132-schedule.pdf", "extracted_text": "\n\n--- Page 1 ---\n\nRequest for: \n\n\u2022  The documents requested are all communications related to \n\nFOI REQUEST NO.

(the Party) under s 137(6) of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918. The core reason for proposed deregistration is the Party's alleged failure to meet the statutory requirement of having at least 1,500 members (s 137(1)(b)).\n\nThe document details that the AEC initiated a deregistration notice on January 13, 2022, to which VOTEFLUX.ORG responded on February 13, 2022, providing a statement and a supplementary membership list containing 4,680 names. Crucially, the Minute states that on March 2, 2022, the Assistant Commissioner instructed that \"further membership testing be performed,\" specifically to \"select the top 1,650 names for testing to conform with the AEC\u2019s testing methodology parameters.\" The conclusion asserts that \"based on the ABS methodology it demonstrated that the Party has failed to demonstrate to have at least 1,500 members,\" recommending deregistration. It also notes that if deregistered, the Party\u2019s application to change its name, abbreviation, and logo will become invalid.\n\nFrom an Objectivist perspective within the context of the FOI request:\n\nThis document starkly reflects a contradiction of Objectivist values, demonstrating bureaucratic obstacles, implied forced altruism, and the suppression of productive achievement, rather than upholding reason, individualism, or free enterprise.\n\n*   **Reason:** The document showcases a profound disconnect from objective reality. VOTEFLUX.ORG submitted a list of 4,680 members, nearly three times the statutory threshold. Yet, the AEC, instead of validating the entire submitted list, arbitrarily restricted its \"testing methodology parameters\" to the \"top 1,650 names.\" This prioritization of an internal, rigid \"ABS methodology\" over the concrete evidence provided by the Party (4,680 members) is irrational. It elevates bureaucratic process and arbitrary internal rules above the verifiable facts, failing to engage with reality on its own terms. The conclusion that the Party \"failed to demonstrate to have at least 1,500 members\" based on this truncated, process-driven test, despite the submission of 4,680 names, is a clear example of unreason.\n\n*   **Individualism:** The entire premise of the deregistration process, underpinned by the 1,500-member threshold (as stated in the FOI request overview and confirmed by the document's purpose), directly assaults the principle of individual rights and voluntary association. Political parties are voluntary associations of individuals pursuing shared goals; dictating a minimum size for political expression is an arbitrary state imposition that infringes on the freedom of individuals to associate and express their views without undue governmental burden. The AEC\u2019s actions, as documented, treat the Party as a collective entity to be processed and regulated according to state dictates, rather than respecting the rights of its individual members to freely organize.\n\n*   **Free Enterprise (Political Sphere):** Analogous to economic free enterprise, a free market of ideas requires an unburdened environment for political expression and organization. The 1,500-member threshold acts as a significant barrier to entry, stifling innovation and competition in the political sphere. The AEC's rigid adherence to its \"ABS methodology\" and its refusal to acknowledge the greater number of members submitted, transforms political organization from a productive achievement\u2014the voluntary gathering of individuals to advocate for their beliefs\u2014into an arduous, bureaucratic gauntlet. The potential invalidation of the Party's name/logo change application upon deregistration further demonstrates a suppression of its identity and operational capacity, undermining its ability to function as a viable entity in the \"market of ideas.\"\n\n**Evidence of Bureaucratic Obstacles, Forced Altruism, or Suppression of Productive Achievement:**\n\n*   **Bureaucratic Obstacles:**\n    *   The requirement to \"demonstrate\" membership via an arbitrary and restrictive \"ABS methodology\" (testing only 1,650 names when 4,680 were provided) is a primary bureaucratic hurdle.\n    *   The entire deregistration process itself, initiated despite the Party seemingly exceeding the membership threshold, represents a significant time and resource drain.\n    *   The invalidation of the Party's application to change its name/logo if deregistered adds another layer of administrative burden and discouragement, regardless of its underlying support.\n\n*   **Forced Altruism:** The document implicitly illustrates forced altruism by compelling VOTEFLUX.ORG to divert resources (time, effort, and financial if applicable) not towards attracting more voluntary support or advancing its political agenda, but towards satisfying the AEC's arbitrary \"ABS methodology\" and responding to its procedural demands. The Party is forced to expend its productive efforts to prove its legitimacy to the state, even when it appears to have already met the state's own stated criteria.\n\n*   **Suppression of Productive Achievement:** The direct consequence of the AEC's actions, as detailed in the Minute, is the deregistration of a political party. This is a direct suppression of the productive achievement of individuals who voluntarily formed and joined VOTEFLUX.ORG to engage in political expression and action. By using arbitrary rules and processes to negate the demonstrated support of nearly 5,000 individuals, the AEC effectively undermines their right to collective political action and stifles their ability to achieve their goals within the established political system.", "model": "gemini-2.5-flash", "generated_at": "2025-06-24T01:49:39.538254", "source_hash": "530f9df1bcd440ed954ac9e1dfc36b42ad2f7c41b5f2d16d1a7b2a47f96b9bb7", "raw_response_path": "data/llm_responses/LEX3132__per_file__objectivist__Document 1.pdf__20250624T014939.json", "output_tokens": 1167, "prompt_tokens": 1319, "total_tokens": 3402, "summary_length": 5728}}, "filename": "Document 1.pdf", "download_path": "/foi_assets/LEX3132/Document 1.pdf", "extracted_text": "\n\n--- Page 1 ---\n\nMinute \n\nClassification: OFFICIAL \nFile reference: OBJECT ID: fA176751 \nTo: Joanne Reid, Assistant Commissioner Disclosure, Assurance and Engagement Branch \n\nThrough:  Stuart Oreo  Director \nCC: \n\nParliamentary Engagement and Party Registration \nAssistant Director  Parliamentary Engagement and Party Registration \n\nSubject: For action \u2013 Deregistration under s 137(6) of the \nCommonwealth Electoral Act 1918 (Electoral Act) \u2013 \nVOTEFLUX.ORG | Upgrade Democracy!

It primarily details the process for assessing the party's compliance with the increased 1,500-member threshold mandated by the \"Party Registration Integrity Act 2021.\" Joanne Reid, Assistant Commissioner, instructs staff to conduct further membership testing for VOTEFLUX.ORG after the party submitted a new membership list claiming 4,680 names. She specifies that only the \"top 1,650 names\" should be selected for testing to conform with the AEC's \"testing methodology parameters,\" despite the party providing a list nearly three times that size. The document outlines the legislative framework (s 138A and s 137 of the Electoral Act) for reviewing party eligibility and deregistration, noting that VOTEFLUX.ORG previously \"failed\" an initial membership test based on a random sample of 53 members, leading to the current deregistration consideration. The AEC's stance is that a failure to satisfy the \"ABS methodology\" alone constitutes \"reasonable grounds\" for concluding a party does not have 1,500 members. The email chain details the procedural steps, notices issued, and the delegate's role in determining deregistration based on whether they are \"satisfied on reasonable grounds\" the party lacks the required membership.\n\nFrom an Objectivist perspective, the document starkly contradicts the values of reason, individualism, and free enterprise, aligning with the concerns raised in the FOI request.\n\n**Reason:**\nThe document demonstrates a profound disregard for objective reality in favor of arbitrary bureaucratic processes. VOTEFLUX.ORG has submitted a list of 4,680 claimed members, well exceeding the 1,500-member threshold. Yet, the AEC\u2019s \"ABS methodology\" dictates that only the \"top 1,650 names\" from this larger list will be tested. This is irrational, as it prioritizes a rigid, pre-defined sample size over the concrete evidence of a substantially larger pool of members. The prior \"FAIL\" result, based on a sample of only 53 members, further exemplifies this irrationality; a sample of that size is statistically inadequate to conclusively determine the status of a large, claimed membership base, especially when a small number of \"denials\" (9) can lead to a \"FAIL.\" The reliance on a \"methodology and formula provided by the ABS\" as the sole \"reasonable grounds\" for determining membership, even when the party presents a much larger list, shows a dogmatic adherence to procedure over the facts.\n\n**Individualism:**\nThe AEC's actions, mandated by the \"Party Registration Integrity Act 2021,\" directly assault the principle of individualism. The state, through the AEC, dictates the terms of voluntary association by imposing an arbitrary 1,500-member threshold for political parties. This infringes upon the individual's right to voluntary association and collective political expression, which should be unburdened by state mandates. VOTEFLUX.ORG, as a voluntary association formed by individuals to advance shared political goals, is treated as an object of state regulation, forced to comply with onerous and irrational demands rather than being acknowledged as a legitimate expression of individual choice and collective action. The implicit premise is that the state, not the individuals forming the party, holds the ultimate authority over political expression.\n\n**Free Enterprise:**\nWhile directly addressing political parties, the document reflects a profound contradiction to the principles of a free market, by extension, a free market of ideas. The 1,500-member threshold acts as an artificial and arbitrary barrier to entry, stifling competition and innovation in the political sphere. It imposes significant \"startup costs\" in terms of member recruitment and validation that new or smaller parties must bear, akin to excessive licensing or regulatory burdens on a business. The AEC's convoluted testing processes, requiring the party to expend resources collecting and submitting data that is then only partially and dogmatically reviewed, represents a profound state interference that burdens productive achievement and discourages genuine political entrepreneurship. A truly free market of ideas would allow political organizations to form and compete based on voluntary support and merit, not based on arbitrary state-imposed hurdles and bureaucratic validation.\n\n**Evidence of Bureaucratic Obstacles, Forced Altruism, or Suppression of Productive Achievement:**\n\n*   **Bureaucratic Obstacles:** The entire process described is an egregious example of bureaucratic obstacles. The multiple notices (s 138A, s 137), the requirement to submit extensive documentation including a membership list, and the AEC's rigid \"ABS methodology\" for testing (which dictates sampling only 1,650 names from a 4,680-name list) create immense procedural hurdles. The initial failure based on a small, questionable sample size (53 members) forces VOTEFLUX.ORG into a protracted and resource-intensive compliance process, demonstrating the AEC's prioritization of process over practical reality.\n*   **Forced Altruism:** VOTEFLUX.ORG is compelled to expend significant resources (time, effort, data management, legal/administrative costs) to satisfy the AEC's arbitrary demands for membership validation. These resources are diverted from the party's actual purpose and productive goals (e.g., advocating for \"Upgrade Democracy!\"). This scenario perfectly exemplifies forced altruism, where a productive entity is compelled to sacrifice its values and resources to serve an arbitrary state mandate, rather than being free to use its resources for voluntary, self-interested aims.\n*   **Suppression of Productive Achievement:** The direct threat of deregistration, stemming from these bureaucratic hurdles and irrational demands, constitutes a direct suppression of VOTEFLUX.ORG's productive achievement in the political sphere. Deregistration would severely cripple its ability to participate effectively in elections and advocate for its platform. The arbitrary 1,500-member threshold itself, and the punitive compliance mechanisms, serve to suppress the formation and growth of new political parties, thereby limiting the diversity of political expression and the potential for productive political innovation in Australia.", "model": "gemini-2.5-flash", "generated_at": "2025-06-24T01:49:58.233909", "source_hash": "4ca8c43d2d7fc263c32ccf75b607cfd3a250439acc3e2fc1f9c98f3c354b2eaf", "raw_response_path": "data/llm_responses/LEX3132__per_file__objectivist__Document 2 Disclosure log.pdf__20250624T014958.json", "output_tokens": 1281, "prompt_tokens": 3843, "total_tokens": 6839, "summary_length": 6400}}, "filename": "Document 2 Disclosure log.pdf", "download_path": "/foi_assets/LEX3132/Document 2 Disclosure log.pdf", "extracted_text": "\n\n--- Page 1 ---\n\nJoanne Reid\nFAD\nStuart Oreo\nRE: Delegate consideration - s 137 response received - VOTEFLUX.ORG | Upgrade Democracy!

VOTEFLUX.ORG | Upgrade Democracy! (the Party) did\nrespond to the s 138A notice, however they did not pass membership testing.

(the Party), \nJanuary 2022 (attached, also accessible at OBJECT ID: A1386429). On 14 February 2022, the Party\n\n, in response to the s 137 Notice issued to the Party on 13\n\n, Secretary and DRO) provided the AEC with an email (the Additional Statement) correcting\n\n\u201ctwo errors made in the correspondence that I sent you yesterday\u201d (attached, also accessible at\nOBJECT ID: A1386415).\n\nBackground\nOn 3 September 2021, the Electoral Legislation Amendment (Party Registration Integrity) Act 2021\n(Party Registration Integrity Act) came into effect, amending the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918\n(Electoral Act), and increased the membership threshold for an eligible political party to 1,500\nmembers. All registered non-Parliamentary parties, including the Party, had until 2 December 2021 to\ncomply with the legislative requirement to have \u2018at least 1,500 members\u2019.\n\nOn 8 October 2021, the Registered Officer of the Party was issued with a notice under s 138A(3) of\nthe Electoral Act (the 138A Notice), requesting the Party provide evidence of compliance with the\nincreased membership requirements and submit a membership list of between 1,500 and 1,650\nmembers by 8 December 2021 (see OBJECT ID: A1157688).\n\ns47Fs47Fs47Fs47Fs47Fs42s47Fs47F\n\n\n--- Page 3 ---\n\nOn 26 November 2021, the AEC sent a reminder to the Party (see OBJECT ID: A1304513).\n\nOn 7 December 2021, the Party responded to the s 138A Notice providing the requested\ndocumentation (OBJECT ID: A1267776). Membership testing was conducted in accordance with the\nmembership testing methodology and formula provided by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS).\n\nA breakdown of the membership testing outcome is at OBJECT ID: A1303995.

Pursuant to s 137(2) of the Electoral Act, the Party was provided with one\nmonth to respond to the s 137 Notice (being 13 February 2022).\n\nOn 13 February 2022, the Registered Officer of the Party provided a response to the s 137 Notice\n(OBJECT ID: A1369037) and on 14 February 2022 the Party \nthe Additional Statement (OBJECT ID: A1386415). The Party\u2019s email of 13 February 2022 also included\na membership list in support of the statement which contains 4,680 names (OBJECT ID: A1369039).\n\n, Secretary and DRO) provided\n\nEligibility Provisions\nPursuant to s 138A(1) of the Electoral Act, the Electoral Commission may review the Register to\ndetermine whether a party remains an \u2018eligible political party\u2019, or whether it should be deregistered\nunder ss 136 or 137 of the Electoral Act. Under s 123(1) of the Electoral Act an \u2018eligible political party\u2019\nmeans a political party that:\n\na.  either:\n\n(i)                  is a Parliamentary party; or\n(ii)                has at least 1,500 members; and\n\nb.  is established on the basis of a written constitution (however described) that sets out the\n\naims of the party.\n\nA \u2018Parliamentary party\u2019 means a political party at least one member of which is a member of the\nParliament of the Commonwealth. The Party does not have, and has never had, a member of the\nParliament of the Commonwealth. Section 136 of the Electoral Act pertains to a party failing to\nendorse candidates and therefore is not relevant to this review.\n\nThe issue in question is whether the statement provide by the Party is sufficient for you, as a\ndelegate, to be assured that the Party has \u2018at least 1,500 members\u2019. Section 137(1)(b) of the Electoral\nAct first requires the delegate of the Electoral Commission to be \u2018satisfied on reasonable grounds\u2019\nthat the Party does not have at least 1,500 members.\n\nLegislative framework\n\ns47F\n\n\n--- Page 4 ---\n\nSection 138A(1) of the Electoral Act outlines the purpose of a s 138A review:\n\nThe Electoral Commission may review the Register to determine whether one or more of the\n\nparties included in the Register:\n\n(a) is an eligible political party; or\n(b) should be deregistered under section 136 or 137.\n\nSections 138A(3 \u2013 5) of the Electoral Act states:\n\n3.  For the purposes of reviewing the Register, the Electoral Commission may give a\nwritten notice to the registered officer of a registered political party requesting\nspecified information on the party\u2019s eligibility to be registered under this Part.\n\n4.  The notice must specify a period within which the information must be provided. The\n\nperiod must be at least 2 months.\n\n5.  The registered officer must comply with the notice within the specified period.\n\nHowever, the Electoral Commission may extend that period.\n\nSection 137(1)(b) of the Electoral Act prescribes that the Electoral Commission is satisfied on\nreasonable grounds that the Party does not have \u2018at least 1,500 members\u2019 and therefore does not\nmeet the requirement of being an eligible political party under s 123 of the Electoral Act to remain in\nthe Register of Political Parties (the Register). The Electoral Commission must give the registered\nofficer of the party notice, in writing, that it is considering deregistering the party under this section,\nsetting out its reasons for considering doing so and the terms of the provisions of subsections (2), (3),\n(4) and (5).\n\nSubsections 137(2 \u2013 5) of the Electoral Act includes:\n\n2.  of the Electoral Act prescribes that where a notice is given under subsection (1) in relation to a\npolitical party, the registered officer of the party or 10 members of the party may, within 1\nmonth after the date on which the notice was given, lodge with the Electoral Commission a\nstatement, in writing, signed by the registered officer or by those members of the party, as the\ncase may be, setting out reasons why the party should not be deregistered under this section.\n\n3.  Where a statement lodged under subsection (2) is signed by 10 members of a political party,\n\nthe statement shall set out the names and addresses of those members and contain a\nstatement that they are members of that party.\n\n4.  Where a notice is given under subsection (1) in relation to a political party and a statement is\nnot lodged under subsection (2) in response to that notice, the Electoral Commission shall\nderegister the party.\n\n5.  Where, in response to a notice given under subsection (1) in relation to a political party, a\nstatement is lodged under subsection (2), the Electoral Commission shall consider that\nstatement and determine whether the political party should be deregistered for the reason set\nout in that notice.\n\ns42s42\n\n\n--- Page 5 ---\n\n\u2018\n\nMembership testing methodology\nUnder the membership testing methodology and formula provided by the ABS it is the Electoral\nCommission\u2019s view that, absent of any relevant factors to the contrary, a failure to satisfy the test\nprovided by the ABS alone constitutes reasonable grounds upon which the delegate of the Electoral\nCommission, can be satisfied that a political party does not have at least 1,500 members.\n\nConsideration of the Statement\nUnder s 137(5) of the Electoral Act, the Electoral Commission shall consider the statement lodged\nunder s 137(2) of the Electoral Act. However, s 137(5) of the Electoral Act stipulates that the Electoral\nCommission shall consider that statement and determine whether the political party should be\nderegistered for the reason set out in that notice.

The core issue stems from the *Electoral Legislation Amendment (Party Registration Integrity) Act 2021*, which raised the membership threshold for registered political parties from 500 to 1,500 members. The documents show the AEC diligently applying this new law, leading to Flux's deregistration after it repeatedly failed to demonstrate 1,500 members through the AEC's \"ABS methodology\" for membership testing, despite submitting lists containing thousands of names.\n\nFrom a left-leaning perspective, several critical issues emerge:\n\n*   **Civil Liberties and Democratic Participation (Deviation):** The most striking deviation from progressive values lies in the *policy itself* \u2013 the increase in the party membership threshold. This government action, enforced by the AEC, fundamentally restricts civil liberties related to freedom of association and political expression. By making it significantly harder for smaller, grassroots, or emerging parties like VOTEFLUX to register, the policy undermines democratic participation and diversity in the political landscape. Progressive values champion broad access to the democratic process, fostering a multitude of voices and pathways for citizens to organize politically. The \"Party Registration Integrity Act 2021,\" despite its name, appears to serve as a mechanism to consolidate power within larger, established parties, effectively stifling alternative or new political movements that may challenge the status quo. The AEC's rigid application of its testing methodology, while procedurally sound, exemplifies a bureaucratic approach that can be seen as prioritizing administrative control over the facilitation of pluralistic political engagement.\n\n*   **Wealth Distribution and Corporate Influence (Indirect Deviation):** While not directly addressed, the increased membership threshold indirectly impacts wealth distribution in the political sphere. Achieving and maintaining 1,500 verifiable members requires significant organizational capacity, resources, and outreach \u2013 often more readily available to well-funded parties or those with established institutional support. This creates a higher barrier to entry for smaller, less resourced, or entirely volunteer-driven parties, potentially reinforcing a political system where financial capital translates into political leverage. This indirectly favors parties that may be more susceptible to corporate influence or aligned with entrenched economic interests, further exacerbating wealth distribution disparities by limiting the political power of less affluent or grassroots movements.\n\n*   **Social Justice (Indirect Deviation):** Smaller parties often emerge to advocate for specific social justice issues or represent marginalized communities whose concerns are not adequately addressed by major parties. By creating a higher barrier to party registration, the policy indirectly hinders the ability of these groups to formally organize and amplify their voices within the electoral system. This can be seen as a step backward for social justice, as it reduces avenues for focused advocacy and representation for diverse segments of the population.\n\nIn summary, while the AEC's actions, as revealed in these documents, reflect a diligent adherence to established administrative procedures and the letter of the law, the underlying governmental policy (the *Electoral Legislation Amendment (Party Registration Integrity) Act 2021*) and its practical impact **deviate significantly from progressive values**. The focus on \"integrity\" through increased barriers to entry risks undermining the very principles of broad democratic participation, political diversity, and equitable access to the electoral system that are foundational to a robust and just society.", "model": "gemini-2.5-flash", "generated_at": "2025-06-22T13:58:01.693364", "source_hash": "5d20b43facdd0322665294e747eb0b3947251b68e761c80ae81657bcdb955151", "raw_response_path": "data/llm_responses/LEX3132__overall__left_leaning__20250622T135801.json", "output_tokens": 683, "prompt_tokens": 4944, "total_tokens": 7345, "summary_length": 3922}, "short_index": {"text": "The FOI documents detail the Australian Electoral Commission's procedural deregistration of VOTEFLUX.ORG due to the *Electoral Legislation Amendment (Party Registration Integrity) Act 2021*, which raised the membership threshold for parties from 500 to 1,500.

By requiring a demonstrable base of support, the government avoids the inefficient allocation of taxpayer resources (e.g., administrative costs for registration, ballot paper space, potential public funding) to political entities with negligible public interest. The AEC's use of a \"membership testing methodology and formula provided by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS)\" signifies a commitment to **economic efficiency** and objective, verifiable processes, preventing arbitrary decisions and ensuring that public funds are directed towards genuine and viable political organizations. The systematic review process, including clear notices and response periods, further reflects a prudent and efficient bureaucratic operation.\n\n*   **Limited Government & Rule of Law:** The AEC's adherence to the *Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918*, specifically sections 137 and 138A, exemplifies a government agency operating strictly within its legislated powers. This aligns with the principle of **limited government**, where state authority is clearly defined and constrained by law. The methodical application of the statute, including providing ample notice and opportunities for parties to demonstrate compliance, reinforces the **rule of law** and safeguards against unchecked bureaucratic discretion. The government is not arbitrarily dictating political existence but rather enforcing a standard established by Parliament.\n\n*   **Individual Liberty:** While the increased membership threshold might, at first glance, appear to impose a barrier to entry for smaller political groups, a conservative view would typically balance this against the need for an orderly and robust electoral system. The requirement for a minimum membership ensures that formally registered parties reflect a substantive level of public engagement, contributing to the integrity and seriousness of the electoral process. This prevents the system from being overburdened by numerous, non-viable entities, thereby enhancing the overall efficiency and clarity of political choice without unduly restricting the fundamental freedom of individuals to associate or advocate for their beliefs outside the formal party registration framework.\n\n*   **National Security:** Although not explicitly addressed, an electoral system underpinned by clear, verifiable registration standards contributes indirectly to national stability and security by ensuring the legitimacy of political actors and processes. A rigorous approach to party registration, as demonstrated by the AEC, minimizes avenues for potential manipulation or the proliferation of non-genuine political entities that could destabilize the democratic process.\n\nIn summary, the documents reveal government actions that largely align with conservative principles by promoting fiscal prudence, operational efficiency, and adherence to established legal frameworks in the administration of the electoral system.", "model": "gemini-2.5-flash", "generated_at": "2025-06-22T13:58:25.708779", "source_hash": "5d20b43facdd0322665294e747eb0b3947251b68e761c80ae81657bcdb955151", "raw_response_path": "data/llm_responses/LEX3132__overall__right_leaning__20250622T135825.json", "output_tokens": 603, "prompt_tokens": 4944, "total_tokens": 7852, "summary_length": 3575}, "short_index": {"text": "From a right-leaning perspective, the Australian Electoral Commission's deregistration of the VOTEFLUX.ORG party, driven by the increased membership threshold mandated by the Electoral Legislation Amendment (Party Registration Integrity) Act 2021, exemplifies a commitment to sound conservative principles.

Instead, the focus immediately shifts to initiating a *new membership test* on the updated list provided by VOTEFLUX.ORG | Upgrade Democracy! (Flux). This indicates a procedural adherence to re-testing rather than a substantive engagement with Flux's specific counter-arguments or statistical justifications, raising questions about the sincerity of the appeal review process.\n\n2.  **Pre-Determined Outcomes:** Internal communications, such as an email dated March 1, 2022, state that Flux \"did not pass membership testing\" from a *previous* review, even *before* the delegate formally requested a new test on the party's latest membership submission.

These documents highlight the AEC's consistent and transparent application of essential regulations designed to ensure that political parties meet the necessary thresholds to participate, thereby fostering public confidence in our democratic system.\n\nFollowing the implementation of the Electoral Legislation Amendment (Party Registration Integrity) Act 2021, which prudently raised the membership threshold for eligible political parties to 1,500, the AEC initiated a comprehensive review of all registered non-Parliamentary parties. This proactive measure provided all parties, including VOTEFLUX.ORG, ample time and opportunity to demonstrate compliance with the new, vital standard.\n\nWhen VOTEFLUX.ORG initially failed to meet the membership requirements through an objective testing methodology provided by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS), the AEC, in a display of due diligence, issued a s 137 notice.

There is not a single shred of evidence of any genuine \"understanding\" or \"evaluation\" of Flux's specific arguments or statistical claims. Instead, the AEC adheres to a rigid, unthinking adherence to a singular \"ABS methodology\" for membership testing, effectively dismissing any nuanced appeal.\n\nThe timeline alone screams incompetence and malice:\n\n*   **February 13, 2022:** Flux responds to the deregistration notice, providing a substantial new membership list of **4,680 names** \u2013 vastly exceeding the 1,500 member threshold. This is a direct, good-faith attempt to demonstrate compliance.\n*   **March 1, 2022:** An internal email, ostensibly seeking approval to forward information to the delegate, brazenly states that Flux \"did not pass membership testing.\" This refers to an *old* test from December 2021, and critically, *pre-judges* the outcome of the delegate's consideration of Flux's *new* evidence. This is not objective advice; it is a calculated attempt to poison the well and steer the delegate towards a pre-ordained conclusion.\n*   **March 2, 2022:** The delegate (Joanne Reid) requests new membership testing on the submitted 4,680-name list, specifically asking to test the \"top 1,650 names.\" This acknowledges the new submission but sets the stage for a mechanical, rather than substantive, review.\n*   **March 21, 2022:** A \"Minute: For action \u2013 Deregistration\" is prepared.

The claim that a comprehensive \"ABS methodology\" test on 1,650 names (requiring contact, verification, and data analysis) could be completed, processed, and unequivocally declared a \"failure\" within this impossibly short timeframe is not merely implausible \u2013 it is a lie. It indicates that the \"new testing\" was either a sham, or the outcome was decided well in advance of any actual test results. The conclusion was written before the evidence could possibly be gathered.\n\nThis sequence reveals a shocking level of bureaucratic contempt:\n\n1.  **Predetermined Guilt:** The AEC's internal communications actively frame the party as failing *before* new evidence is considered, and certainly before any new testing could be completed.\n2.  **Procedural Facade:** The request for \"new testing\" on March 2nd was nothing more than an empty gesture, a box-ticking exercise to mask a foregone conclusion. The March 21st minute exposes this as a cynical charade.\n3.  **Disregard for Due Process:** The very purpose of the s137 notice \u2013 to allow the party to provide reasons why it *should not* be deregistered \u2013 was fundamentally undermined. Flux submitted new, compelling evidence, which the AEC demonstrably failed to genuinely assess. Their focus remained fixated on a past failure, despite new information directly addressing the issue.\n4.  **Incompetence or Malice:** Either the AEC is so incompetent that it believes a rigorous statistical test can be completed in under three weeks, or it is so malicious that it intentionally fabricated the \"failed\" outcome before the test was even finished. Both interpretations are damning.\n5.  **Bureaucratic Tunnel Vision:** The documents show a complete inability or unwillingness to engage with any arguments beyond a narrow, pre-defined \"membership testing methodology,\" highlighting a rigid, anti-democratic bureaucracy incapable of genuine discretion or fair consideration.\n\nThe fact that Flux was also actively working to update its name and logo further underscores the devastating impact of this pre-meditated deregistration, crushing their efforts and nullifying their administrative actions without a fair hearing. These documents are not just a record of deregistration; they are an indictment of an electoral commission seemingly operating with predetermined outcomes, procedural deceit, and a chilling disregard for the democratic rights of political parties.", "model": "gemini-2.5-flash", "generated_at": "2025-06-22T13:59:36.947898", "source_hash": "5d20b43facdd0322665294e747eb0b3947251b68e761c80ae81657bcdb955151", "raw_response_path": "data/llm_responses/LEX3132__overall__highly_critical__20250622T135936.json", "output_tokens": 972, "prompt_tokens": 4941, "total_tokens": 8307, "summary_length": 4589}, "short_index": {"text": "The FOI documents brutally expose the AEC's meticulously choreographed bureaucratic charade, revealing a chillingly predetermined outcome: the deregistration of VOTEFLUX.ORG, executed under a cynical veneer of process.

The Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) is shown engaged in the process of deregistering VOTEFLUX.ORG | Upgrade Democracy! based on a rigid, arbitrary membership threshold, illustrating the dangers of collectivism and governmental interference in voluntary association.\n\nThe \"Party Registration Integrity Act 2021,\" which increased the membership threshold to 1,500, is a clear violation of individual rights and an assault on political freedom. It is an act of **government overreach**, dictating the very terms under which individuals may associate and express their political views. The fundamental right to form a voluntary association, regardless of size, is paramount. The state has no legitimate claim to impose an arbitrary numerical hurdle for a group to be recognized, as this prioritizes a collective, quantitative measure over the individual liberty to form and join political movements. This act stifles **personal initiative** and productive achievement by creating an artificial barrier to entry for new political voices.\n\nThe AEC's meticulous adherence to an \"ABS methodology\" for membership testing is a prime example of **bureaucratic interference** and a profound abandonment of reason. Despite VOTEFLUX.ORG providing a list of 4,680 names, the AEC insists on testing a smaller, statistically-defined sample (1,650 names) to \"conform with our testing methodology parameters.\" This demonstrates a preference for an abstract, arbitrary statistical model over the concrete reality of individuals voluntarily joining a party. The idea that a party \"failed\" to demonstrate 1,500 members based on such a methodology, even with a claimed membership of nearly 5,000, is profoundly irrational. It implies that bureaucratic process, not actual individual choice or the party's own rational self-interest in accumulating members, determines its legitimacy. This is a form of **suppression of personal initiative**, forcing productive individuals and organizations to navigate an irrational, state-imposed labyrinth of rules rather than allowing them to thrive on their own merits and voluntary support.\n\nThe entire process, from the initial notice of potential deregistration to the detailed \"consideration of the statement,\" is steeped in **forced altruism**. VOTEFLUX.ORG is compelled to expend resources, time, and effort\u2014not to serve its own rational self-interest or its members, but to satisfy an arbitrary state mandate. The party is forced to \"prove\" its existence to the state, rather than being permitted to exist simply by virtue of its members' voluntary association and support. The \"FAIL\" designation, based on an \"ABS methodology,\" underscores the irrationality of this requirement: the state, not the individuals involved, determines what constitutes a \"valid\" political association.\n\nThis scenario starkly contrasts with the principles of **laissez-faire capitalism** and individual liberty. Just as the government should not dictate the terms of economic exchange, it should not dictate the terms of voluntary political association. The market of ideas, like the economic market, should be free, allowing individuals to form and support organizations without arbitrary state interference. The AEC's actions, mandated by legislative overreach, represent a collectivist mindset that values state control and bureaucratic order over the spontaneous, productive actions of free individuals.
