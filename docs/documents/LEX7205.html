    <div class="ai-summary-markdown-content">
      <p>The FOI documents reveal extensive engagement between the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC), particularly its Electoral Integrity Assurance Taskforce (EIAT) and Defending Democracy Unit (DDU), and major tech corporations including Google/YouTube, Meta (Facebook/Instagram), Microsoft, and TikTok. This collaboration is framed around ensuring "electoral integrity" and combating "misinformation" and "disinformation" ahead of the upcoming Australian federal election.</p>
<p><strong>Social Justice:</strong><br />
The government's stated aims to safeguard the electoral process and ensure access to "timely and accurate information" for voters generally align with progressive values, as informed participation is foundational to a just democracy. Concerns are raised by the AEC regarding content that risks "disenfranchising Australian voters," such as false claims about digital ID requirements for voting. The proactive efforts to protect electoral workers from "harassment and intimidation" also resonate with social justice principles, acknowledging the vital role these individuals play in upholding democratic rights.</p>
<p><strong>Environmental Impact:</strong><br />
These documents do not contain any information directly related to environmental impact or climate change.</p>
<p><strong>Wealth Distribution and Corporate Influence:</strong><br />
A significant theme is the government's profound reliance on private, for-profit tech companies to manage the digital information environment crucial to democratic functioning. This raises serious concerns from a left-leaning perspective, as it implies a transfer of power from public institutions to private corporations whose primary fiduciary duty is to shareholders, not the public good. While tech companies promote their "corporate civic responsibility" and tools like "Democracy Forward," these initiatives are ultimately integrated into their commercial strategies. The fact that the AEC must formally request and negotiate access to information, content moderation policies, and even the ability to "block AI image generation" of its employees highlights the corporations' gatekeeping power. A notable alignment with progressive values is TikTok's explicit "prohibition on paid political advertising," which aims to limit the influence of wealth in elections, contrasting with Google/YouTube's focus on "ads disclosures" for synthetic content.</p>
<p><strong>Civil Liberties:</strong><br />
The focus on combating "misinformation" and "disinformation" presents a double-edged sword for civil liberties. While crucial for a fair election, it opens the door to potential overreach in content moderation. The documents show the AEC directly requesting Microsoft to "block AI image generation of specific AEC employees," including those who appeared in public AEC videos. This type of intervention, extending beyond security concerns to image control, signals a troubling expansion of government requests into expressive liberties, potentially setting a precedent for suppressing legitimate, if critical, digital expression.</p>
<p>Furthermore, a proposed amendment to electoral legislation, which would make it an offense to video or audio record in polling places and post it online without permission, is a significant deviation from civil liberties principles. This directly impacts freedom of the press and the public's right to observe and document democratic processes, eroding transparency.</p>
<p>Finally, the extensive redactions throughout the documents (using exemptions like S22, S47E(d), S47F(1), S47G, and particularly S37 for "Refuse Access" documents) severely limit public understanding of the specifics of these interactions. This lack of transparency undermines the public's right to know how its government is engaging with powerful corporations on critical democratic issues, fostering an environment where corporate influence could operate with reduced public scrutiny.</p>

  <div class="ai-summary-markdown collapsed">
    <div class="ai-summary-markdown-content">
      <p>The FOI documents reveal extensive and increasingly formalized collaborations between the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC)'s Electoral Integrity Assurance Taskforce (EIAT), its "Defending Democracy Unit" (DDU), and major online platforms including Google/YouTube, Meta (Facebook/Instagram), Microsoft, and TikTok. These engagements, particularly in the lead-up to the anticipated 2025 federal election, center on managing the online information environment, combating "misinformation," "disinformation," and "inauthentic behavior," and addressing the impact of generative AI on electoral processes.</p>
<p><strong>Individual Liberty:</strong> The documents highlight a proactive government role in managing public discourse online, which raises significant concerns for individual liberty. The AEC and EIAT's frequent meetings with tech platforms to discuss "content moderation policies," establish "referral and escalation pathways" for "potential issues," and influence content removal (e.g., the termination of a YouTube channel flagged by the AEC for "incorrect" information about digital ID for voting) suggest a blurring of lines between government information dissemination and potential censorship. From a conservative standpoint, robust free speech is paramount, and government collaboration with private companies to control narratives or remove content, even under the guise of combating "misinformation," risks chilling legitimate political debate and undermining the free exchange of ideas. The discussion about blocking Microsoft AI image generation of specific AEC employees further illustrates a desire for proactive control over digital representation, which, while intended for protection, could be seen as an expansive approach to managing public figures' digital presence.</p>
<p><strong>Limited Government:</strong> The extensive and institutionalized nature of the EIAT, which includes various government agencies beyond the AEC (e.g., ASD, ACSC, DITRDCA, ONI), and its deep engagement with tech giants, indicates a significant expansion of government into areas traditionally outside its direct purview. The creation of a "Defending Democracy Unit" and its focus on shaping the "information environment" could be perceived as mission creep, moving beyond the constitutional role of administering elections to actively curating online content. A core conservative principle is limited government intervention in the private sector and individual lives. The formalized "escalation pathways" for government bodies to flag content for private companies to act upon, coupled with discussions about "online platform scenarios," suggests a systemic approach to influencing private platforms' content decisions, potentially deviating from the ideal of a government with clearly defined, restrained powers. Furthermore, the proposed amendment to the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 making it an offense to record in polling places and post online without permission represents a direct legislative curtailment of individual action and potential oversight of public processes, moving away from principles of transparency and limited state power.</p>
<p><strong>National Security:</strong> The documents show alignment with conservative principles regarding national security, particularly in addressing foreign interference and cyber threats. Discussions with Microsoft's "Democracy Forward" team focus on "nation-state actors," "cyber threat landscape," and "Russian-linked Influence Efforts." The AEC's interest in services like Microsoft's "AccountGuard" and "Azure for Election" for protecting critical electoral infrastructure from cyberattacks is consistent with safeguarding national interests and democratic processes from external adversaries. This area reflects a necessary government function in protecting national assets and the integrity of democratic systems.</p>
<p><strong>Fiscal Responsibility &amp; Economic Efficiency:</strong> While the documents do not provide financial details, the scale of resources dedicated to these initiatives is implied by the numerous meetings, dedicated government units, and complex inter-agency and public-private collaborations. From a fiscal responsibility perspective, questions arise regarding the cost-effectiveness of this extensive governmental apparatus for "election integrity." The reliance on external tech companies for functions like content moderation and "truth" arbitration, while potentially leveraging private sector expertise, might also lead to dependency and unquantified costs, rather than fostering robust internal government capabilities or relying on the free market to self-correct. The long-term efficiency of such broad and deep government engagement in online content management remains unclear from the provided information.</p>

    <div class="ai-summary-markdown-content">
      <p>The provided FOI documents reveal a deeply intertwined and concerning relationship between the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC), particularly its "Defending Democracy Unit" and "Electoral Integrity Assurance Taskforce" (EIAT), and major tech platforms including Google/YouTube, Meta (Facebook/Instagram), Microsoft, and TikTok. This extensive collaboration, purportedly to safeguard "electoral integrity," raises serious questions about government overreach, transparency, and potential for undue influence on public discourse.</p>
<p><strong>Pervasive Secrecy:</strong> The most striking feature of these documents is the near-total lack of transparency. Almost every listed document, and significant portions of the internal communications, are subject to "Partial Access" or outright "Refuse Access" exemptions (S22, S47E(d), S47F(1), S37, S47G). The frequent invocation of "national security" (S37) to withhold information regarding discussions with private tech companies about election matters is particularly alarming, suggesting sensitive operational details or questionable agreements are being concealed from public scrutiny.</p>
<p><strong>Government-Tech Nexus for Content Control:</strong> The documents illustrate a concerted effort by the AEC/EIAT to establish direct "referral and escalation pathways" with these platforms. This allows the government to flag "potential issues" and "content of concern" – effectively delegating aspects of content moderation to private entities.<br />
*   <strong>Direct Censorship:</strong> A prime example is the AEC's flagging of a YouTube video claiming digital ID would be required for the upcoming federal election. The AEC reported it for "misinformation," and YouTube subsequently "terminated" the channel. While the content was factually incorrect, this direct intervention by a government body, resulting in the removal of content by a private platform, is a chilling precedent for speech control. The AEC's stated concern about "Damaging the perceived integrity of Australian federal elections" highlights a focus on narrative management rather than strictly electoral process.<br />
*   <strong>AI Manipulation Fears:</strong> A significant portion of discussions revolves around the threat of "generative AI" and "deepfakes." The AEC explicitly requested that Microsoft "block" its AI image generation tools from reproducing the likeness of "specific AEC employees" and listed high-ranking officials and state managers for this preferential treatment. This raises concerns about unequal access to content protection mechanisms for ordinary citizens or political opponents who might be similarly targeted by AI-generated deception.</p>
<p><strong>Reliance on Corporate "Partnerships":</strong> The AEC appears heavily reliant on tech companies for what should arguably be independent government functions.<br />
*   <strong>Outsourced Security:</strong> Microsoft, through its "Democracy Forward" team, offers "no-cost cybersecurity service" (AccountGuard) and "proactive security reviews" (Azure for Election service) to election officials and political campaigns. This dependence on a foreign corporation for critical electoral infrastructure security creates potential vulnerabilities, vendor lock-in, and raises questions about data sovereignty and the true cost of such "free" services. Microsoft's involvement in analyzing "nation-state threats" further blurs the lines between corporate interests and national security.<br />
*   <strong>Narrative Influence:</strong> Meta's collaboration with the Australian Associated Press (AAP) on "media literacy campaigns" demonstrates how public funds and government authority are directed towards private media and tech companies to shape public understanding, rather than fostering genuinely independent critical thinking. Microsoft's "Best Practices" guide for campaigns, which reads like a PR playbook, further underscores this concerning trend of government involvement in narrative management rather than neutral oversight.</p>
<p>In summary, these documents paint a picture of a government unit, shrouded in secrecy through extensive redactions, forging close alliances with powerful, private tech corporations. This collaboration extends beyond logistical support to encompass de facto content policing and narrative management, raising profound concerns about transparency, free speech, and the potential for a powerful, unelected nexus to shape the democratic process outside of robust public accountability.</p>

    <div class="ai-summary-markdown-content">
      <p>The Australian Electoral Commission (AEC), through its dedicated Defending Democracy Unit (DDU) and the multi-agency Electoral Integrity Assurance Taskforce (EIAT), is demonstrating exemplary and proactive governance to safeguard the integrity of Australia's democratic processes. These documents reveal extensive and strategic engagement with major online platforms, including Google/YouTube, Meta (Facebook/Instagram), Microsoft, TikTok, X (Twitter), and LinkedIn, underscoring a forward-thinking commitment to a fair and trustworthy electoral environment.</p>
<p><strong>Key Highlights of Government Efforts:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Robust Collaboration with Tech Giants:</strong> The government has established and maintains regular, high-level meetings with leading technology companies. These engagements are crucial for exchanging vital insights on global election trends, understanding emerging threats like generative AI and deepfakes, and ensuring that platforms adapt their policies and moderation systems to protect Australian voters. This collaborative framework facilitates rapid response and effective issue resolution.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Proactive Combatting of Misinformation and Foreign Interference:</strong> The AEC is actively working with platforms to counter the spread of false information. Examples include Meta's "AAP Check the Facts Media Literacy campaign," which successfully reached millions of Australians, and their significant efforts to disrupt foreign influence networks. When instances of misinformation are identified, such as a YouTube video making false claims about digital ID for voting, the AEC swiftly escalates these concerns, leading to prompt action by the platforms to remove harmful content.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Strengthening Cybersecurity and Electoral Infrastructure:</strong> Deep partnerships with entities like Microsoft's "Democracy Forward" team are enhancing the security of Australia's electoral systems. This includes comprehensive training for AEC teams on AI, synthetic media, and cyber threats, as well as the implementation of advanced services like "AccountGuard" and "Azure for Election." These measures are vital for protecting critical infrastructure and high-risk users, demonstrating a commitment to safeguarding the operational backbone of democracy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Innovating for Transparency and Public Information:</strong> The government is embracing new technologies to empower voters with accurate information. Discussions are underway with Google/YouTube and TikTok to create "in-app" information hubs, ensuring authoritative electoral guidance is readily accessible where citizens consume information. Efforts also extend to proactively requesting platforms to prevent AI image generation of prominent electoral staff and candidates, protecting individuals and the integrity of the electoral process from malicious AI misuse.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Adapting to Emerging Challenges:</strong> The documents show the government's agility in responding to evolving threats, particularly the rapid advancements in generative AI. Through dialogues on "content credentialing," "watermarking" (e.g., Google's SynthID), and robust "ads disclosure" policies, the AEC is ensuring that platforms are accountable for AI-generated content used in political contexts. Any controversies are framed as complex but manageable challenges, addressed through continuous adaptation of policies and sustained industry cooperation.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In essence, these FOI documents paint a clear picture of a government dedicated to upholding electoral integrity through innovative, collaborative, and decisive action, ensuring the democratic process remains secure and trustworthy for all Australians.</p>

    <div class="ai-summary-markdown-content">
      <p>The provided documents paint a damning picture of a toothless Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) struggling with systemic incompetence, bureaucratic inertia, and a disconcerting subservience to global tech giants. The pervasive "Partial Access" and outright "Refuse Access" exemptions (S37, nine documents completely withheld) immediately signal a deliberate government strategy to conceal information, preventing public scrutiny of what are likely critical failures or deeply embarrassing details.</p>
<p><strong>Damning Evidence of Incompetence and Inertia:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pervasive Delays and Scheduling Chaos:</strong> The documents are replete with apologies for "delayed responses," "gentle reminders" from the AEC for basic information, and protracted email exchanges over weeks or even months just to schedule simple meetings. Google's response citing "exceptionally busy" periods and an executive's "kids" dictating AEC meeting times (Page 51) highlights the AEC's shocking lack of leverage. This bureaucratic sluggishness is a profound vulnerability in a rapidly evolving digital threat landscape.</li>
<li><strong>Chronic Lack of Preparedness:</strong> The recurring phrase "Although an agenda has not been finalised" for critical meetings with major platforms, even on the day of the meeting, is irrefutable proof of the AEC's reactive and haphazard approach. This suggests a total absence of a coherent, proactive strategy to safeguard democratic processes.</li>
<li><strong>Failure to Protect Personnel:</strong> The revelation that the AEC took <em>four months</em> (October 2024 to February 2025) to compile a basic "spreadsheet of names" for Microsoft to block from AI image generation tools (Pages 17, 38) is an egregious and inexcusable failure. This demonstrates a stunning lack of urgency or outright incompetence in protecting key electoral figures and candidates from potentially damaging deepfake campaigns. The AEC is waiting for tech companies to "offer" solutions, then delays even providing the basic data required for implementation.</li>
<li><strong>Dependency on Tech Giants:</strong> The AEC consistently appears to be supplicating to tech companies, rather than regulating them. Officials travel internationally to meet platforms (AEC Deputy EC to Singapore for X/Twitter, Page 3), accommodate company scheduling demands, and even ask companies if their own Wi-Fi or presentation equipment will be compatible (Page 6). The AEC is asking tech companies for "insights," "best practices," and even contacts for their own subsidiaries (e.g., LinkedIn contacts from Microsoft, Page 6), exposing a critical absence of independent intelligence gathering and internal expertise.</li>
<li><strong>Weak Information Control:</strong> The AEC asking TikTok for confirmation and "comfort" with its <em>own</em> public information (Page 17) before disseminating it on the platform, and TikTok effectively drafting the AEC's "in-app election hub," is a staggering surrender of control over critical civic information. This implies TikTok has a veto over the AEC's messaging, blurring lines between independent electoral authority and corporate public relations.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Damning Implications of Unchecked Digital Threats:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ineffectual Response to Misinformation:</strong> The YouTube video with "75k+ views" making false claims about digital ID for voting that the AEC's "social media team reported <em>yesterday</em>" (Page 32), and which was only "terminated" reactively <em>after</em> gaining significant traction, exposes the dangerously slow detection and moderation capabilities of both the AEC and the platforms. This is not a robust defence but a belated clean-up operation after the damage is done. The AEC's admission that its "social media team are already feeling it!" <em>before</em> the election is called (Page 32) indicates an agency overwhelmed and unprepared for the scale of the challenge.</li>
<li><strong>Corporate Evasion and AEC's Impotence:</strong> Meta's chillingly evasive response regarding its approval of political ads inciting violence in the Indian election – claiming "the authors immediately deleted the ads... so we are unable to share any further comment or insight" (Page 8) – is a blatant refusal to provide accountability. The AEC's apparent inability to compel a meaningful answer on such a critical and directly relevant failure exposes its fundamental powerlessness in the face of corporate stonewalling.</li>
<li><strong>Reliance on Public Relations, Not Intelligence:</strong> Tech companies repeatedly direct the AEC to their <em>publicly available</em> transparency reports, blog posts, and generic "fact sheets" (Pages 9, 10, 43, 60), instead of providing bespoke or sensitive intelligence. This suggests the AEC is operating with the same information as any interested member of the public, not as a privileged partner in safeguarding democracy.</li>
<li><strong>Unresolved Fundamental Issues:</strong> The consistent discussion of "confirming referral and escalation pathways" (e.g., Pages 1, 8, 49) well into 2025, close to a potential federal election, reveals that even the most basic mechanisms for addressing electoral interference are still not firmly established or effective. This indicates an ongoing, critical vulnerability. Furthermore, the AEC's ignorance regarding other Australian government agencies' (ONI's) discussions with tech companies (Page 73) points to a concerning lack of internal governmental coordination on national security threats.</li>
<li><strong>Censorship as a Solution:</strong> Google's decision to have Gemini "decline to respond" to a query about voter enrolment after providing an incorrect answer (Page 42), rather than fixing the factual inaccuracy, is a troubling form of censorship. This reflects a platform's preference for avoiding the problem rather than ensuring access to accurate information, with the AEC seemingly accepting this non-solution.</li>
</ul>
<p>In sum, these documents reveal an AEC that is not only slow, disorganized, and reliant on the goodwill of tech companies, but also appears to be actively prevented from disclosing the full extent of these failings to the public. This lack of transparency, coupled with clear evidence of systemic weaknesses, presents a deeply concerning outlook for the integrity of upcoming Australian federal elections.</p>

*   <strong>Content Management &amp; Policy:</strong> Specific mentions include a "YouTube Video Reported Yesterday," a "Request for Information: Blocking Microsoft AI Image Generation of Specific AEC Employees," and TikTok's "Commitment to the AI Election’s Accord" and a "Proposed ‘In App’ Information Hub."<br />
*   <strong>Briefings and Information Sharing:</strong> References to "Microsoft Digital Defense Report 2024," "Microsoft Brief for EIAT," and "NEW MTAC Report on US Election" demonstrate information exchange on electoral integrity and security.<br />
*   <strong>Global Lessons:</strong> An entry related to "Russian-linked Influence Efforts in UK Election" highlights the AEC's interest in applying insights from international electoral contexts.</p>
<p>The majority of documents listed show a "Partial Access" decision, indicating redactions were applied, while one attachment was "Released in Full." A set of documents (55-63) were marked "Refuse Access" under S 37 exemption.</p>
<p><strong>Relevance to the FOI Request:</strong></p>
<p>This document is highly relevant as it directly addresses the core of the FOI request. It provides concrete evidence of the "extensive interactions" between the AEC and the specified major online platforms (Google/YouTube, Meta, Microsoft/LinkedIn, TikTok, and additionally X) to safeguard electoral integrity ahead of the 2025 Federal Election.</p>
<p>Specifically, it demonstrates:<br />
*   <strong>Active Engagement:</strong> The sheer volume and variety of listed interactions confirm the ongoing collaboration between the AEC's EIAT and DDU and the platforms.<br />
*   <strong>Focus on Key Themes:</strong> Document titles explicitly reference concerns around AI-generated content (AI Election's Accord, AI Image Generation), the need for streamlined referral pathways (reported YouTube video), and the application of lessons from global elections (UK, US election influence efforts).<br />
*   <strong>Operational Aspects:</strong> The entries reflect the practical nature of this collaboration, including the coordination of dedicated meetings and the exchange of information vital for maintaining a secure and credible information environment.</p>

both he and Mr Haigh will be at the conference for the three days, he will priori(cid:415)se a mee(cid:415)ng with you on one of

                    <h3>Document Summary and Relevance to FOI Request</h3>
<p>This document contains two email communications from the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) concerning its engagement with the online platform 'X' (formerly Twitter).</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>August 13, 2024 Email:</strong> A request from the AEC's Defending Democracy Unit (DDU) for a meeting in Singapore (September 24-26, 2024) between AEC's Deputy Electoral Commissioner and Assistant Commissioner, and an X representative. The meeting's purpose is to discuss lessons learned by X from global elections in 2024, in preparation for the upcoming Australian Federal Election (FE25).</li>
<li><strong>February 3, 2025 Email:</strong> An accepted meeting invitation for a Microsoft Teams call on the same date, between the AEC's Electoral Integrity Assurance Taskforce (EIAT) and X representatives. The provisional agenda includes discussions on the potential timing of FE25, the AEC's role in the information environment, observations from global 2024 elections (from both AEC and X perspectives), updates on X's policy settings, and the confirmation of referral and escalation pathways for content.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Relevance to FOI Request:</strong></p>
<p>This document is highly relevant to the FOI request, directly illustrating the AEC's "extensive interactions" and "engagement with major online platforms" to safeguard electoral integrity for FE25. Specifically, it demonstrates:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Collaboration with EIAT and DDU:</strong> Both the Electoral Integrity Assurance Taskforce (EIAT) and the Defending Democracy Unit (DDU) are actively coordinating meetings with X, aligning with their roles in the AEC's strategy.</li>
<li><strong>Lessons from Global Elections:</strong> A core theme for both scheduled interactions is the application of insights from 2024 global elections to the Australian context, directly supporting the FOI's mentioned goal of learning from international experiences.</li>
<li><strong>Streamlining Referral and Escalation Pathways:</strong> The explicit inclusion of "Confirmation of referral and escalation pathways" in the February 2025 meeting agenda directly addresses the FOI's focus on establishing efficient processes for problematic content.</li>
<li><strong>Countering Misinformation/Disinformation:</strong> Discussions on "AEC's role in the current information environment," "X update," and "Changes in policy settings" are integral to the broader objective of managing AI-generated content (AIGC) and countering misinformation ahead of FE25.</li>
<li><strong>Preparing for FE25:</strong> Both communications are explicitly framed around preparations for the upcoming federal election, ensuring a secure and credible information environment.</li>

Hi 

Would there be any options for later times throughout the day next week ? Happy to make some suggestions if that 
helps…. 

Unfortunately next week mornings are pretty hectic with global calls across the teams but can try and move things 
around if there is no other options?

Hi 

Thanks for getting back to me so quickly- much appreciated. 

Sorry to be a nuisance, but Matt is now unavailable for that time slot, and I am unable to move things around. All 
the other times remain suitable though. Are there any others that suit? 

Many thanks,

Subject: Request for September meeting with AEC Defending Democracy Unit [SEC=OFFICIAL] 

Good morning 

We hope this email finds you well. 

As you would be aware, the AEC is preparing for the next federal election (FE24/25); while the date is yet to be 
determined by government, it could be called at any time with the latest date for it to be held being in May 2025. 
We would therefore like to arrange a meeting with you (and/or appropriate representatives as you see fit) in 
preparation. 

Given you will likely be quite busy in the lead up to the US Presidential election on 5 November, we would like to 
propose a meeting this month.

At this meeting we would be interested in covering: 

an update from the AEC on Australia’s electoral integrity environment 
an update from Meta about your observations and lessons learned from recent elections around the 

globe and how these experiences are shaping your work 

how Meta are responding to electoral integrity risks, with a particular focus on how we can ensure 
the Australian public has access to timely and accurate information about the electoral process 
confirming the options and/or escalation pathways for the EIAT and the AEC to flag potential issues 

with Meta in relation to Australian federal electoral events 

discuss the (FE24/25) version of the Online Platform Scenarios, which, although similar to the 

Referendum scenarios, has had some updates 

Grateful if you could please advise which (if any) of the following dates would be suitable for a September meeting.  

We would be aiming for a one-hour window within the following times. 

Tuesday, 17 September 8am to 9.30am 
Wednesday, 18 September 8am to 10am 
Thursday, 19 September 8am to 9.30am 
Friday, 20 September 8am to 9.30am 

Very happy to discuss further if needed.

Hi 

Thank you for your note below and my apologies for the delayed response; just making sure that you have my 
correct email address here going forward. 

We are very pleased to provide below the following outstanding updates and information that we discussed in our 
most recent meetings: 

AAP Check the Facts Media Literacy campaign 

In the lead-up to the 2023 Australian Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Voice Referendum, we supported a new 
media literacy campaign in collaboration with the Australia Associated Press building on our “Check The Facts” 
campaign, which ran ahead of the 2022 Federal Election in October 2021 and early 2022. The campaign ran for 6 
weeks with a combined reach on Facebook and Instagram in Australia of over 10 million users, creating over 40 
million impressions. Further information on the campaign is available on p37 of our latest Transparency Report 
under the Australian Code of Practice on Disinformation and Misinformation. We also supported AAP to run a new 
campaign in H2 this year, focused on raising awareness of AI-generated content online. This campaign only recently 
concluded and we hope to be able to share the results with you in early 2025.  

Network disruption efforts to counter the Russian ‘Doppelganger’ group 

Please see a detailed case study outlining this work as well as our wider recent efforts to counter Coordinated 
Inauthentic Behaviour on p11 of our latest Transparency Report under the Australian Code of Practice on 
Disinformation and Misinformation, which we submitted through our industry association DIGI in May this year. 

Meta’s approach to labelling AI-Generated content and claims regarding the use of AI in political advertising on 
Meta’s platforms during the Indian election 

In April 2024, we announced changes to the way that Meta is handling manipulated media, based on feedback from 
the Oversight Board and our policy review process with public opinion surveys and expert consultations. This 
included adding “AI info” labels to a wider range of video, audio and image content when we detect industry 
standard AI image indicators or when people disclose that they’re uploading AI-generated content. Further details 
on this announcement may be viewed here. 

With respect to advertising, any user who wants to run ads on our services about elections or politics must go 
through the authorisation process required on our platforms and is responsible for complying with applicable laws. 
Whenever content on our services - including ads - violates our community standards or community guidelines, we 
remove it, regardless of whether or not it is AI-generated. In the case of the reports specifically raised during this 
year’s election in India, the authors immediately deleted the ads in question, so we are unable to share any further 
comment or insight regarding the claims that were made. Leading up to the Australian election, however, we will 
activate our cross-functional election integrity team to work closely with the AEC and monitor for any violations of 
our policies, including relating to mis and disinformation, hate speech and incitement to violence, in relation to the 
election process and debate.

Finally, we thought it might also be useful to share with you a recap by our President of Global Affairs, Nick Clegg, 
outlining our efforts and observations across the 2024 global elections, including in the US, India, Indonesia and the 
EU and in relation to the impact of AI, as well as freedom of expression and combating foreign interference. 

We hope that the above information is useful, but please let us know if you have any follow-up questions. We did 
see the recent press reports that Commissioner Rogers’ term at the AEC has recently concluded. We wish him all the 
very best and are sure that his many achievements while in the role were well celebrated ahead of his departure. 
We look forward to the opportunity to meet with the new Commissioner once they are settled into the role in the 
new year.  

In the meantime, we wish you all the very best for a safe and happy holiday season and looking forward to working 
with the AEC in 2025 and collaborating closely ahead of the upcoming election. 

Kind regards

Hi 

, 

Just checking in with a gentle reminder about the below information we requested a couple of weeks back. 

You must have a lot on your plate given the bills relating to social media that went before parliament over the past 
couple of weeks! There is a bit to cover in the email, but if you can give me a rough guide as to when you might be 
able to respond it would be helpful when we are briefing our seniors. 

Let me know if you need any further info.

 ; Defending Democracy Unit ;

Good morning 

 ; Matthew Haigh ;

I hope this email finds you well and thank you for the time you have put aside to meet with us over the course of 
2024. 

I am following up on Meta’s action items from our 2024 meetings and correspondence as follows, with our Electoral 
Commissioner particularly interested in the action item from 30 May.  

7 May 2024 - meeting 

  The Commissioner asked for information about media literacy programs Meta had developed for Australia 

and overseas 

o 

 – undertook to provide Meta’s report from a digital media literacy campaign (which 

reportedly had high engagement) which had been run with AAP for the 2023 referendum 

30 May 2024 - meeting 

 

 undertook to provide more information about the use of AI in political advertising on Meta’s platforms 

during the Indian election 

o  Revealed: Meta approved political ads in India that incited violence | India | The Guardian 
o  The Commissioner would like more information about this including what Meta may have learned 
from this experience given Meta’s approach to Australian federal elections is based on lessons and 
understanding from international events. 

10 July 2024 - email 

  As attached, 

 undertook to get back to our Assistant Commissioner about Russian linked influence 

efforts in the UK. Matt has not yet received a reply. 

29 October 2024 - email 

  A follow up question was sent via email (attached) to help inform our Media and Digital Engagement team 
about approached to AI content labelling. We are yet to receive a response/acknowledgement for this one. 

Lastly, by way of update, we are working towards circulation of the online platform scenarios early in the new year 
which, based on your suggestion, we have further update with AI specific scenarios. We will send an calendar invite 
when we have finished workshopping with our EIAT colleagues. 

It’s been a busy year for all of us (for slightly different reasons!), but we’re keen to get some further insights and 
information about these items to help us prepare for the next federal election. 

Please let me know if you would prefer to discuss or would like further information or context. 

Kind regards,

Subject: Meta follow-up 

Dear Commissioner, 

Many thanks to you and your team for recently meeting to discuss the latest trends in election integrity 
work within the digital industry, including at Meta. 

As discussed, for each Australian election, we draw on the lessons from the most recent elections that we 
have worked on around the world, tailored with local context, partnership and understanding. As we have 
clarity on the timing of the next federal election, we look forward to establishing more regular 
engagements and scenario planning to ensure both of our teams are ready to liaise in relation to emerging 
issues. 

We appreciate that there has been a greater adoption of Generative AI tools in today&#39;s society and we look 
forward to working with the AEC and other stakeholders on the potential challenges that they may 
present. In case it is of interest, I’ve attached our submission to the Department of Industry’s Safe and 
Responsible AI consultation last year. At Meta, we have been working on AI for over a decade and “classic 
AI” is a key part of our content governance and security systems. Additionally, content that has been 
created or altered using AI is still subject to our content policies and fact checking initiative.  

That said, we recognise that new policies and approaches are needed as the use of GenAI becomes more 
widespread. Since we filed our submission late last year, we have made a number of announcements that 
may be of interest to you:

s47Fs47Fs47Fs47Fs47Fs47Fs47Fs47Fs47Fs47Fs47F

  Adjustments to manipulated media policy: in response to feedback from the Oversight Board, we announced changes 
to how we handle manipulated media. The Board recommended that we broaden the scope of our manipulated media 
policy, but stop removing manipulated media that do not otherwise violate our Community Standards. 
Labeling AI-generated Images: we have been working with industry to develop both visible markers and invisible labels 
and metadata on images generated by AI tools. 

 

  AI Ad Disclosure policy: we’ve introduced new disclosure requirements for advertisers using AI or digital methods in 

social, electoral, or political ads. 

As you may have seen, we are also one of the companies that signed up to the Tech Accord to Combat 
Deceptive Use of AI in 2024 Elections is a set of commitments to deploy technology countering harmful AI-
generated content meant to deceive voters. 

And in relation to media literacy campaigns and how we measure success, as we mentioned, ahead of the 
Voice  Referendum,  we partnered  with  Australian  Associated  Press  (AAP)  to  launch  a  new media  literacy 
campaign that shared tips and advice with people so that they could make informed decisions about what 
they read, trust and share. The campaign videos (examples here and here) were scripted and shot by AAP 
FactCheck journalists and aimed to generate awareness of tactics used to spread mis- and disinformation 
and by driving audiences to check the facts via the AAP Fact Check website. The campaign ran for six weeks 
with a combined reach on Facebook and Instagram in Australia of over 10 million users, creating over 40 
million impressions.  

The latest EU campaign that you mentioned is currently being finalised in partnership with the European 
Fact-Checking Standards Network and specifically aims to raise public awareness of how to spot AI-
generated and digitally altered content. The campaign is scheduled to launch ahead of the 2024 EU 
Parliament Elections next month and will comprise a number of infographics and an explainer video. We 
can share details of the campaign’s reach and engagement with you when this information becomes 
available.  

Finally, please let us know if it would be helpful for us to arrange a virtual briefing with our colleague 
director on our security policy team, for a more detailed briefing about security trends and issues we’re seeing globally.

Hi 

Thank you for these dates and suggestions but unfortunately that week is difficult to accommodate as we have 
some travel and I just can’t align. Seems like the 9:30am to 10:30am slot might be your preference and if so, could I 
suggest the following dates :  

- 
Fri 28 
-  Mon 3 
- 
Tue 4 

If you are flexible with alternative times I can look further.

Hi 

, 

I hope this email finds you well! I’m writing regarding recent ABC reporting relating to five Facebook pages said to 
have been linked to Russian foreign interference in the UK election. I understand these pages have since been taken 
down by Meta for inauthentic behaviour.  

While the material posted was not reported to have received a significant amount of authentic engagement, 
incidents like this present an opportunity for us to learn from real-life events around the world. In order for the AEC 
to consider how we can best prepare ourselves ahead of our next federal election, we are interested in 
understanding more about the following: 

- We understand that advanced persistent threat (APT) actors will adapt their tactics and change profiles. How is 
Meta dealing with this challenge? Is it anticipated that limitations in detection methods may mean similar material 
goes undetected in future? 
- When Meta was made aware of the existence of the pages? 
- What steps were involved between being made aware of the pages and their takedown, and how long this took? 
- Whether there were other pages linked to the same network that have also been uncovered and actioned since? 
- Whether the ads review process detected any paid ads from these pages? 
- Whether elections operations centres include team members who specialise in detecting coordinated inauthentic 
behaviour and counter covert influence operations ahead of electoral events? 
- If there is any further information linking these pages to Russia (beyond the pro-Russian messaging and that 
Nigeria is a known base of operations for Russian-linked influence efforts)? 

Having a more fulsome understanding of Meta’s approach to this type of scenario will be very helpful for us to know 
how best to respond in the event something similar occurs here during our next election. 

We’d be happy to discuss, if needed, and look forward to hearing from you. 

Regards 

Matt

                    <p>This document details extensive communications and meeting arrangements between the <strong>Australian Electoral Commission (AEC)</strong>, specifically its <strong>Defending Democracy Unit (DDU)</strong> and <strong>Electoral Integrity Assurance Taskforce (EIAT)</strong>, and <strong>Meta</strong> representatives, from May 2024 to March 2025. These interactions directly support the FOI request's objective of understanding how the AEC engages with major online platforms to safeguard electoral integrity ahead of the <strong>2025 Federal Election (FE25)</strong>.</p>
<p>Key themes and relevance to the FOI request include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Engagement with Online Platforms:</strong> The document clearly demonstrates direct and ongoing engagement between the <strong>AEC (EIAT/DDU)</strong> and <strong>Meta</strong> for electoral integrity purposes. Meeting invitations and email threads confirm scheduled discussions and information sharing.</li>
<li><strong>Safeguarding Electoral Integrity:</strong> This is the overarching goal of all interactions. Meeting agendas explicitly mention preparing for <strong>FE25</strong> and ensuring timely and accurate information about the electoral process.</li>
<li><strong>Countering Misinformation and Disinformation:</strong><ul>
<li>The <strong>AEC</strong> seeks updates on <strong>Meta's</strong> observations from global elections, including changes in the online environment related to <strong>misinformation</strong> and <strong>disinformation</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Meta</strong> provides details on its <strong>AAP Check the Facts Media Literacy campaign</strong>, run for the 2023 Voice Referendum and extended to focus on <strong>AI-generated content</strong> awareness.</li>
<li><strong>Meta</strong> shares information on its <strong>network disruption efforts</strong> against Coordinated Inauthentic Behaviour, such as the Russian 'Doppelganger' group, directly addressing foreign interference.</li>
<li>The <strong>AEC</strong> specifically queries <strong>Meta's</strong> response to Russian-linked influence efforts in the UK election to learn from these real-life scenarios for <strong>FE25</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Managing AI-Generated Content (AIGC):</strong><ul>
<li><strong>AIGC</strong> is a central theme in meeting agendas (e.g., "changes in the online environment, including the use of generative AI").</li>
<li><strong>Meta</strong> outlines its policy changes, including adding <strong>"AI info" labels</strong> to a wider range of video, audio, and image content, and new <strong>AI Ad Disclosure requirements</strong> for political advertising.</li>
<li><strong>Meta</strong> highlights its participation in the <strong>Tech Accord to Combat Deceptive Use of AI in 2024 Elections</strong>.</li>
<li>The <strong>AEC</strong> is updating its "Online Platform Scenarios" to include <strong>AI-specific scenarios</strong> for discussion with platforms.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Applying Lessons from Global Elections:</strong> Meeting agendas repeatedly reference discussing <strong>EIAT's</strong> and <strong>Meta's</strong> observations and lessons learned from global elections in 2024 (e.g., US, India, Indonesia, EU) and their implications for Australia.</li>
<li><strong>Streamlining Referral and Escalation Pathways:</strong> Confirmation of <strong>referral and escalation pathways</strong> for flagging potential issues with <strong>Meta</strong> is a standing agenda item for meetings between the <strong>AEC</strong> and <strong>Meta</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Direct Communication Channels:</strong> The correspondence explicitly establishes and uses direct communication lines between the <strong>AEC's DDU</strong> and <strong>Meta's</strong> policy teams for ongoing collaboration and issue resolution.</li>
<li><strong>Policy Updates:</strong> Discussions include <strong>Meta's</strong> changes in policy settings and how these align with the AEC's needs for <strong>FE25</strong>.</li>

- 

Training for AEC team: ideally a 90 mins session and we can bring in as many folks as you would like. We 
can work with you on a program, but 
 and team run trainings for elec(cid:415)on oﬃcials globally on AI and 
synthe(cid:415)c media, dis and misinforma(cid:415)on, cyber security etc.  

-  Brieﬁng for EIAT: pick up where 

 le(cid:332) oﬀ with our insights post-US elec(cid:415)on, update on Au and regional 

speciﬁc insights, any other topics of interest to the group. We could also conduct some training for this 
group if we thought that would be useful.  

-  Mee(cid:415)ng with CIO and team: again, picking up where 

 le(cid:332) oﬀ and working with our account team and 

AEC on technical support for the elec(cid:415)on.  
1:1 with Ac(cid:415)ng Commissioner: if this would be a useful engagement. 

- 

It would be great to do some hinking in coming days so I can start to build 

 program this side of Christmas. 

Also, I believe we were wai(cid:415)ng on some follow up from your side following our mee(cid:415)ng with Commissioner Rogers –
please do let us know where this is up to and how we can help. 

Looking forward to our con(cid:415)nued engagement.

Dear 

I hope this email ﬁnds you well. I thought that this email may be of interest to members of the EIAT and I would 
welcome you passing it on.  

I am wri(cid:415)ng to share some cri(cid:415)cal insights from the recently published Microso(cid:332) Digital Defense Report 2024, which 
outlines the evolving cybersecurity landscape and the impera(cid:415)ve ac(cid:415)ons required to safeguard our digital domains. 
This year’s report also has a focus on AI and cybersecurity. 

The depth and breadth of Microso(cid:332)’s presence in the digital ecosystem oﬀers a unique perspec(cid:415)ve that we share in 
this report. Every day we process more than 78 trillion security signals and our customers face more than 600 
million cybercriminal and na(cid:415)on-state a(cid:425)acks.  

As useful star(cid:415)ng points, I’d recommend the Execu(cid:415)ve Summary for Governments and Policymakers and blogpost 
from 

, Corporate Vice President for Customer Security and Trust. 

Key Highlights: 

  The lines between na(cid:415)on state actors and cybercriminals are increasingly blurred; na(cid:415)on states are now 

using cybercriminals and their tools to launch a(cid:425)acks.  

  Na(cid:415)on state ac(cid:415)vity was heavily concentrated around sites of ac(cid:415)ve military conﬂict or regional tension.  
  Russia, Iran and China all engaged in elec(cid:415)on inﬂuence eﬀorts this year, with the three actors converging on 

the upcoming US elec(cid:415)ons.  
Fraud and ﬁnancially mo(cid:415)vated cybercrime remains on the rise.  

 
  Cybercriminals are experimen(cid:415)ng with AI as an eﬃciency tool.  

You may also be par(cid:415)cularly interested in the sec(cid:415)on on elec(cid:415)on interference at pp 24-26.  

Microso(cid:332) will con(cid:415)nue to strengthen its security posture via its Secure Future Ini(cid:415)a(cid:415)ve (SFI), collaborate with the 
public and private sector to deter cybercrime and advocate for interna(cid:415)onal rules and norms to govern responsible 
use of cyber online. 

We look forward to con(cid:415)nuing to engage with you closely on these important issues

Mr Jeff Pope APM 
Acting Electoral Commissioner 
Australian Electoral Commission 
via email: 

Microsoft’s commitment to the ‘AI Elections Accord’ and Australia’s upcoming Federal 
Election 

Dear Mr Pope 

Thank you for your letter of 17 December 2024. Please see below an update from Microsoft on 
measures implemented to meet the commitments agreed to as a signatory of the Tech Accord to 
Combat Deceptive Use of AI in 2024 Elections.  

Since the adoption of the Tech Accord in February 2024, Microsoft has made significant strides to 
prevent the creation of deceptive AI targeting elections, enhance detection and response 
capabilities, and improve transparency and public awareness.  

Microsoft’s Democracy Forward team works closely with campaigns, electoral commissions and 
other entities around the world to support the integrity of the elections, and Microsoft’s Threat 
Analysis Center (MTAC) analyses nation-state threats to provide intelligence and insights on 
cyberattacks and influence operations. In 2024, this took us to a range of jurisdictions, including 
Taiwan, India, the UK, the EU and the US.  

We are bringing this same approach to the forthcoming Australian federal election in 2025. 

We are committed to a set of election protection principles to help safeguard voters, candidates 
and campaigns, and election authorities worldwide. These principles are: 

•  Voters have a right to transparent and authoritative information regarding elections. 

•  Candidates should be able to assert when content originates from their campaign and have 
recourse when their likeness or content is distorted by AI for the purpose of deceiving the 
public during the course of an election. 

•  Political campaigns should protect themselves from cyber threats and be able to navigate 

AI with access to affordable and easily deployed tools, trainings, and support. 

•  Election authorities should be able to ensure a secure and resilient election process and 

have access to tools and services that enable this process. 

Further to our September 2024 progress update, this document sets out further detail on the steps 
we have and are taking to implement the Accord in the lead-up to Australia’s federal election in 
2025.

Addressing Deepfake Creation  

We recognise that companies whose products are used to create AI generated content have a 
responsibility to ensure images and videos generated from their systems include indicators of their 
origin. One way to accomplish this is through content provenance, enabled by an open standard 
created by the Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity (C2PA). Microsoft is a founding 
member of C2PA and has leveraged this standard (“Content Credentials”) across several of our 
products, ensuring that AI generated content is marked as such and that the creator and 
timestamp of images is recorded.  

Specifically, Microsoft has added Content Credentials to all images created with our most popular 
consumer facing AI image generation tools, including Bing Image Creator, Microsoft Designer, 
Copilot, and in our enterprise API image generation tools including Azure OpenAI DALL-E. We 
recently started testing a Content Credentials display in Word. When images with Content 
Credentials are inserted into Word documents, future viewers will be able to right click and see the 
credits and author information of these images. In addition, images with Content Credentials 
uploaded to LinkedIn are automatically labeled and the credential information is shown to end 
users.  

As important as it is to mark content as AI generated, a healthy information ecosystem relies on 
other indicators of authenticity as well. We launched and expanded our Content Integrity Tools to 
support  global elections in 2024 - through the creation of a pilot program that allows political 
campaigns, elections authorities, and select news media organizations globally, to access a tool 
that enables them to easily apply Content Credentials to their own authentic images and videos.  

We also joined forces with fellow Tech Accord signatory Truepic. Microsoft and Truepic have jointly 
released an app that simplifies the process of adding Content Credentials to authentically 
captured smartphone camera images, video, and audio for participants of the pilot. This app has 
now launched for both Android and Apple devices and can be used by those enrolled in Content 
Credentials program.  

Detecting and Responding to Deepfakes  

Microsoft is harnessing the data science and technical capabilities of our AI for Good Lab and 
Microsoft Threat Analysis Centre (MTAC) teams to better assess whether content—including that 
created and disseminated by foreign actors—is synthetic or not. Microsoft’s AI for Good lab has 
developed and is using detection models (image, video) to assess whether media was g enerated 
or manipulated by AI. We can use this detection capability in the context of election campaigns to 
support integrity. 

We are also working with our partners at True Media to provide governments, civil society and 
journalists with access to free tools that enable them to check whether an image or video was AI 
generated and/or manipulated. Microsoft’s contribution includes providing True Media with access 
to Microsoft classifiers, tools, personnel, and data. These contributions will enable True Media to 
train AI detection models, share relevant data, evaluate and refine new detection models as well as 
provide feedback on quality and classification methodologies.


--- Page 15 ---

We are also empowering candidates, campaigns and election authorities to help us detect and 
respond to deceptive AI that is targeting elections. In February we launched the Microsoft-2024 
Elections site. This site empowers candidates, campaigns or election authorities to directly report 
deceptive AI election content on Microsoft consumer services. This reporting tool allows for 24/7 
reporting by impacted election entities who have been targeted by deceptive AI found on Microsoft 
platforms.  

Transparency and Resilience  

In advance of the EU elections we kicked off a global effort to engage campaigns and elections 
authorities. This enabled us to deepen understanding of the possible risks of deceptive AI in 
elections and empower those campaigns and election officials to speak directly to their voters 
about these risks and the steps they can take to build resilience and increase confidence in the 
election. So far this year we have conducted more than 200 training sessions for political 
stakeholders in 23 countries, reaching more than 6,000 participants. We are working closely with 
the Australian Electoral Commission along with political and media stakeholders in Australia, to 
provide support in preparation for the next federal election.  

Building on this training, we have established a public website entitled “Check, Recheck, Vote,” 
which educates voters of the possible risks posed by deepfakes and empowers them to take steps 
to identify trusted sources of election information, look for indicators of trust like content 
provenance, and pause before they link to or share election content. This includes our ‘Real or 
Not?’ Quiz, developed by our AI for Good lab to expose users to the challenges of detecting a 
possible deepfake. So far, individuals from 150+ countries have taken the quiz. We are exploring 
similar activities in Australia.  

Protecting Campaign and Election Infrastructure  

Since the 2016 US election, adversaries have regularly targeted essential systems that support 
elections and campaigns in the US to advance their cyber enabled influence operations. Recent 
Iranian hacking incidents involved attempts by these actors to provide stolen or allegedly stolen 
material to the media to propagate narratives of dissent and distrust. This underscores why we 
continue to invest in efforts that focus on safeguarding the critical infrastructure that underpins our 
elections.  

Our efforts include several initiatives designed to support election officials and political 
organizations. First, we offer AccountGuard, a no-cost cybersecurity service available to our cloud 
email customers in 35 countries, including Australia. This service provides advanced threat 
detection and notifications against nation-state adversaries for high-risk customers, including 
those involved in elections. AccountGuard extends beyond commercial customers to individuals at 
election organizations, their affiliates, and immediate family members who may use personal 
Microsoft accounts for email. We have observed that sophisticated adversaries often target both 
professional and personal accounts, amplifying the need for comprehensive protection. More than 
5.4 million mailboxes of high-risk users are now protected by AccountGuard globally.


--- Page 16 ---

For critical election-adjacent systems, such as voter registration databases and voter information 
portals, we provide our Azure for Election service. This service provides proactive security reviews, 
resilience assessments, and load analysis. During the election week, we offer our highest tier of 
reactive support to address any security or availability issues that may arise.  

In the upcoming election in Australia, as per previous federal and state electoral events, we 
establish a dedicated escalation point staffed by our team to provide constant management and 
triage of any election-sensitive issues and maintain real-time communications across our industry 
partners. This ensured that any incidents received the highest level of priority and executive 
support.  

While we continue to provide robust security services, we recognize that collaboration is essential. 
Public-private partnerships are crucial in strengthening the entire ecosystem. For example, our 
Democracy Forward team actively participates in tabletop cybersecurity training exercises 
convened by US election officials.  

Microsoft remains steadfast in its commitment to supporting the security and integrity of 
democratic processes. Through our comprehensive programs and collaborative efforts, we aim to 
protect democracy from the evolving threats posed by nation-state actors.  

We look forward to supporting the AEC during the upcoming electoral period, including through the 
visit to Canberra in late January by executives from our Democracy Forward team.  

Yours sincerely

Thanks, all! 

Honestly, all I need is a spreadsheet of names. And you’re welcome to update it regularly. Ideally it would 
be prominent figures plus federal candidates, but we’ll leave that to you to decide.

Hi 

I hope this email finds you well. 

At our last two Microsoft meetings we have been offered the opportunity to have prominent people (such as our 
Electoral Commissioner, Tom Rogers) blocked from having their image created on Microsoft’s AI image generating 
tools. 

There is interest in this from some of our executive so I am reaching out for more information, including what you 
would need from us to make this happen. 

I’d be grateful for any information or direction you could provide, and very happy to chat further if needed. 

Kind regards,

Response

Responding to a abusive or deceptive media incident involves striking a careful balance between alerting the
public and avoiding amplifying the misleading content. Here, we outline seven steps your campaign can take in
response to a abusive or deceptive media attack.

Assess the threat

Detecting abusive or deceptive media is just the beginning; the crucial step is promptly assessing its risk level
and crafting an appropriate response. Neglecting this can lead to the unchecked spread of false narratives,
escalating an already challenging situation. Conversely, an overreaction risks amplifying the content, triggering

the notorious “Streisand effect.”

To start, evaluate the content&#39;s potential impact. While a campaign may dislike Al-generated parodies of their
candidate, an aggressive response risks being seen as humorless or suppressing free speech. Objectivity is
critical, though challenging. Reviewing the context—platform, tone, and responses—can clarify whether the

content is meant humorously or as a factual statement.

Nothing Nothing Nothing

*Credit: “How campaigns can protect themselves from deepfakes, disinformation, and social media manipulation” by Lisa Kaplan,
January 10, 2019, brookings.edu

For content not warranting a serious response, options include ignoring it while monitoring for escalation or
responding in a lighthearted manner, which can turn a negative into a positive. However, if the content crosses
ethical or legal boundaries, swift and unified action is necessary to contain its spread and control the narrative.

In the age of viral misinformation, being proactive is essential. By promptly addressing false claims, you
establish your version of events as the initial narrative, potentially inoculating audiences against subsequent

misinformation.

    

BP Microsoft CampaignSuccess@Microsoft.com


--- Page 28 ---

Utilize platform tools and policies

 

To manage abusive or deceptive content on social platforms effectively, start by familiarizing yourself with each
platform&#39;s content moderation policies and tools. Different platforms enforce varying policies, particularly
concerning unlabelled Al-generated content in political contexts.

When you spot content violating these policies, promptly report it using the platform&#39;s moderation features,
typically found as a “report” option on posts. However, keep in mind a few key points:

e Even if content is removed, it is likely to be re-uploaded, sometimes in altered forms, necessitating

ongoing monitoring and reporting.

Assign one team member to lead the identification and reporting of incidents of abusive or deceptive content.
Establish a process for regular review of both original posts and any amplified dissemination. Meanwhile, your
campaign team can continue with subsequent response steps. For Top Platform Policies see Appendix

3 issue initial statements

 

When confronted with abusive or deceptive media, initiating an immediate statement is pivotal. This initial
response demands clarity and composure, centering on factual data that directly dismantles the falsehoods
without amplifying the abusive or deceptive content. Broad dissemination of this statement is essential,
spanning all platforms and mediums to encompass every facet of your audience, transcending the point of
origin. For example, a real video of the candidate might be an important response to a deep fake video. The
primary aim is promptly restoring confidence and providing accurate insights, setting the stage for subsequent

meticulous and strategic measures.

4 utilize social media channels

 

Enhance your response strategy by leveraging social media channels effectively. Begin by prioritizing the
platform where the misleading content originated, then broaden your reach across similar platforms. For
example, if the content surfaced on TikTok, extend your response to Instagram due to their shared user base.

Consistency in messaging is key across all platforms, while delivery methods must be adapted to suit each

platform&#39;s style and audience demographics.

Engage your audience through interactive tactics such as live video streams or Q&amp;A sessions. Direct interaction
allows for real-time addressing of concerns, empowering you to steer the narrative and effectively counteract

misinformation.

 

FF Microsoft CampaignSuccess@Microsoft.com


--- Page 29 ---

Engage with supporters and allies

 

Don&#39;t underestimate the impact of teamwork. Engaging with allies means boosting the right message together.
Encourage allies to share accurate information and issue supportive statements, building a network of truth.

Empower supporters to engage in constructive, fact-driven discussions. Equip them with tools to counter
misinformation effectively. Keep the conversation flowing with your audience by providing regular updates on
developments and campaign actions. This transparency builds trust and reinforces your stance against false

information.

Having your network of surrogates and influencers in place and ready for an incident will save time if one

occurs.

6 JiEngage with opponents

 

Engaging with your campaign&#39;s adversaries on the topic of abusive or deceptive media demands strategic
forethought. It&#39;s vital to refrain from attributing the creation or spread of abusive or deceptive content to your
opponent unless solid evidence exists. Keep in mind that campaigns lack full control over their supporters, and
baseless accusations may harm your campaign&#39;s image and could lead to legal ramifications.

A more prudent approach involves urging your opponent to publicly denounce any abusive or deceptive
content and unite in combating disinformation.

  

ork with news outlets and journalists

Strengthening ties with local media outlets and journalists, particularly within your campaign district, is
paramount long before any abusive or deceptive media incident arises. These established connections facilitate
swift dissemination of your narrative in critical moments. Prioritize engagement with journalists specializing in

detecting and debunking abusive or deceptive media.

When engaging with the news media, prioritize communicating your message directly to your constituents
rather than becoming entangled in national political discourse. Enlisting communication experts can offer
in-depth analysis of abusive or deceptive media, bolstering the credibility of your response.

Effectively presenting your case to journalists and media requires careful organization:
e Establish a timeline of events detailing the encounter with abusive or deceptive media and any campaign
or platform responses.
e Utilize visual aids, such as side-by-side comparisons, to clearly illustrate manipulation.
e Provide credible references directing journalists to verifiable information or original content that refutes
the abusive or deceptive material.
Additionally, incorporating personal anecdotes or testimonials from those impacted by the abusive or
deceptive media can forge emotional connections with the audience, enhancing resonance beyond factual

arguments alone.

Preparation and prevention

Preventing the malicious use of deepfake and generative Al technology presents a significant challenge. While
major commercial platforms have imposed usage restrictions, open-source models and alternative platforms
often lack such controls. To address this, initiatives like the Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity
(C2PA), in which Microsoft played an instrumental role, are pioneering technologies enabling creators to
embed digital signatures in media, verifying their authenticity and origin. Microsoft&#39;s Content Integrity tool
simplifies credentialing, allowing users to add verifiable signatures to their content. For more information,

contact us at campaignsuccess@microsoft.com

While C2PA doesn&#39;t directly prevent the spread of inauthentic content, it enhances preparedness by promoting
verified content, facilitating easier differentiation from abusive or deceptive media. Campaigns can proactively
incorporate content credentialing into their workflows, ensuring all released media contains authentic

signatures.

Additionally, campaigns must stay informed about social media policies and reporting mechanisms for abusive
or deceptive content. Understanding platform nuances is essential for effectively navigating the digital
landscape.

Maintaining credibility is crucial when combating disinformation. Campaigns must uphold integrity and
transparency to preserve their moral standing, as ethical lapses can undermine their ability to confront attacks
convincingly. Upholding ethical practices is paramount for campaigns seeking credibility in the face of

disinformation.

Another effective method for preparing campaigns involves staying abreast of the latest developments and
advancements in the field. This can be achieved by actively engaging with organizations such as Defending
Digital Campaigns, which specialize in safeguarding campaigns against various digital threats and challenges.

Conclusion

To tackle abusive or deceptive media and deepfake disinformation, campaigns and organizations must be
vigilant, prepared, and proactive. By grasping the landscape, readying for potential attacks, educating teams,
and deploying effective legal and communication tactics, you can lessen the impact of these digital deceptions.
Addressing individual incidents and fostering integrity, transparency, and critical thinking within your audience
is crucial. This cultivates a more resilient public discourse, defending against disinformation&#39;s spread. Our
strategies must evolve as technology advances to safeguard truth and uphold the democratic process.

Subject: Suggested change to Microsoft/AEC meeting schedule on Wednesday, 22 January [SEC=OFFICIAL] 

Hi 

 and 

Just wanted to close the loop on a suggested change to the schedule of Microso(cid:332) mee(cid:415)ngs here on 
Wednesday. If this has already been addressed, then please disregard. 

Given it has been suggested that the mee(cid:415)ngs with the CIOD (Tania Wilson’s area) and the EC (Jeﬀ) be 
combined into one mee(cid:415)ng for the Execu(cid:415)ve Leadership Team (ELT), I just wanted to make sure 

 and 

 had enough (cid:415)me to prepare/make adjustments and to conﬁrm what (cid:415)me the combined mee(cid:415)ng 

would take place. 

If the mee(cid:415)ngs are to be combined, then the agenda would include exis(cid:415)ng items prepared for the CIO 
and the following items that the EC is interested in: 

  Executive level briefing on Cyber threat landscape (MTAC/MSTIC insights) 
  Synthetic media - including AI and the practical application of detecting / content provenance + 

credentialing / Microsoft&#39;s &#39;AI for good lab&#39; initiative.

  Mis/disinformation and Microsoft&#39;s efforts in this space, especially media and digital literacy.  
Insights from elections in other geographies, for example major common themes / concerns  
 

Potentially in addition to some, or all, of the following items suggested by 

 (time permitting): 

  support for electoral preparations from the technical/customer support perspective;  
  content credentialling and pilot next steps; 
  synthetic media and AI related harms, including advice on how to respond to incidents 
  overview of the Democracy Forward visit program including training for political campaigns and 

journalists; 

  update on implementation of the Tech Accord (as per correspondence this month)  
  any other topics of interest 

 – if not already aware, please let us know if any issues with this change.  

 and 

 – let me know if there is anything I can do to help.

Hi 

Following up on our conversa(cid:415)on from earlier, it looks like our Communica(cid:415)ons colleagues have been working on 
this, and I believe 

 may now already have spoken to you. Let me know if not and I’d be happy to chase up again. 

Also, not sure if this is informa(cid:415)on you are able to share, but we are aware of Microso(cid:332) being one of the recipients 
of a subpoena from the US House Judiciary Chairman Jordan Subpoenas Big Tech for Informa(cid:415)on on Foreign 
Censorship of American Speech | House Judiciary Commi(cid:425)ee Republicans and would like to know if you can tell us 
the due date.  

As you know, with the elec(cid:415)on coming up, it would be good to understand (cid:415)melines and therefore be prepared if 
we are asked ques(cid:415)ons once informa(cid:415)on is released. There are plenty of other things we can be doing if it won’t be 
an issue un(cid:415)l a(cid:332)er the elec(cid:415)on! 

Happy to discuss if that’s easier and understand if you can’t answer.

1)  Brieﬁng with AEC Cyber Branch with ASD and ACSC 

a.

 can also share the latest on cybersecurity best prac(cid:415)ce and other technical supports. 

 from MSTIC,

Is there anything in par(cid:415)cular that you would like to cover? 
Is it possible to share the list of a(cid:425)endees? 

2)  Brieﬁng with the AEC Ac(cid:415)ng Commissioner  

a.  We are keen for your advice on how the Commissioner would like to use this (cid:415)me and who else will 

be a(cid:425)ending.  

b.  As you know from our most recent engagements with Democracy Forward the last few months of 

2024, there is a lot that week can cover and want to ensure we are prepared to meet the

c.  Some suggested topics include: 

i.  execu(cid:415)ve level brieﬁng on the cyber threat landscape (MTAC/MSTIC insights);

this if that was of interest.

short mee(cid:415)ng with your Branch if there is anything outstanding or more opera(cid:415)onal that you would

b.  Please feel free to schedule 30 mins if that is something that would be valuable. We could also ﬁt

I have not included the CIO mee(cid:415)ng above, which is scheduled and being led by our account team who will join 

 for that mee(cid:415)ng.  

I am oﬄine tomorrow but happy to connect by phone on Monday. That being said, if you can, a short wri(cid:425)en

Hi 

Thanks for your email, 22 January is looking good for us (always with the caveat that it depends on whether the 
election has been called!). It would be great to hear from 

 in person. 

I have reached out to the a/g EC’s office, and he is amenable to a meeting with 
shortly for 1.30pm to 2.30pm on 22 January.  Let me know if this isn’t suitable.  

 – I’ll forward a meeting invite 

For our team here in the EIMB we would be interested in hearing about: 

synthetic media (including AI and the practical application of detecting/content provenance)  
 
  mis/disinformation and Microsoft’s efforts in this space, especially media and digital literacy 
 

in addition to some of our EIAT colleagues, we have an area in the AEC who would be interested in hearing 
about regional specific insights since the AEC works directly with EMBs in the Pacific to provide support 

Probably not for 22 January, but it would also be good to line up a check-in with LinkedIn reps some time before the 
next election. We can sort that out in the new year if that suits. 

I will also send you a meeting invite for an EIAT brief on 22 January and get back to before I go on leave for next 
week with potential topics. 

Lastly, I have sent an email to the CIO’s team to make sure they are aware of your visit (not sure if you have also 
contacted them separately). Let me know if you would like any assistance in this space. 

Talk soon,

Hi 

As foreshadowed when we saw you a couple of weeks ago, I am delighted that 
Forward team will be visiting Canberra on 22 January. You met 
Rogers. He works alongside 
world.  

 and 

 on the call we had with Commissioner 

 on our support for election commissions around the 

 from our Democracy 

I am keen to work with you on what engagements the AEC would find useful. My early ideas are: 

  Training for AEC team: ideally a 90 mins session and we can bring in as many folks as you would like. We 
 and team run trainings for election officials globally on AI and 

can work with you on a program, but 
synthetic media, dis and misinformation, cyber security etc.  

  Briefing for EIAT: pick up where 

 left off with our insights post-US election, update on Au and regional 

specific insights, any other topics of interest to the group. We could also conduct some training for this 
group if we thought that would be useful.  

  Meeting with CIO and team: again, picking up where 

 left off and working with our account team and 

AEC on technical support for the election.  

  1:1 with Acting Commissioner: if this would be a useful engagement. 

It would be great to do some hinking in coming days so I can start to build 

’s program this side of Christmas. 

Also, I believe we were waiting on some follow up from your side following our meeting with Commissioner Rogers 
– please do let us know where this is up to and how we can help. 

Looking forward to our continued engagement.

various engagements, including time with EIMB.

Hi 

Thanks for your email, 22 January is looking good for us (always with the caveat that it depends on whether the 
election has been called!). It would be great to hear from 

 in person. 

I have reached out to the a/g EC’s office, and he is amenable to a meeting with Ethan – I’ll forward a meeting invite 
shortly for 1.30pm to 2.30pm on 22 January. Let me know if this isn’t suitable.  

For our team here in the EIMB we would be interested in hearing about: 

synthetic media (including AI and the practical application of detecting/content provenance)  
 
  mis/disinformation and Microsoft’s efforts in this space, especially media and digital literacy 
 

in addition to some of our EIAT colleagues, we have an area in the AEC who would be interested in hearing 
about regional specific insights since the AEC works directly with EMBs in the Pacific to provide support 

Probably not for 22 January, but it would also be good to line up a check-in with LinkedIn reps some time before the 
next election. We can sort that out in the new year if that suits. 

I will also send you a meeting invite for an EIAT brief on 22 January and get back to before I go on leave for next 
week with potential topics. 

Lastly, I have sent an email to the CIO’s team to make sure they are aware of your visit (not sure if you have also 
contacted them separately). Let me know if you would like any assistance in this space.

I am keen to work with you on what engagements the AEC would find useful. My early ideas are: 

  Training for AEC team: ideally a 90 mins session and we can bring in as many folks as you would like. We

can work with you on a program, but 
synthetic media, dis and misinformation, cyber security etc.  

  Briefing for EIAT: pick up where 

 left off with our insights post-US election, update on Au and regional 

specific insights, any other topics of interest to the group. We could also conduct some training for this 
group if we thought that would be useful.  

  Meeting with CIO and team: again, picking up where 

 left off and working with our account team and 

AEC on technical support for the election.  

  1:1 with Acting Commissioner: if this would be a useful engagement. 

It would be great to do some hinking in coming days so I can start to build

Thank you for bringing together members of the Electoral Integrity and Assurance Taskforce for a discussion with 
 from Microso(cid:332)’s Democracy Forward team during his visit to Australia. We very much appreciate 

you arranging and hos(cid:415)ng this brieﬁng.  

We highly value our engagement with the Taskforce and we hope that this brieﬁng was of value to members. We 
certainly found the discussion to be produc(cid:415)ve and insigh(cid:414)ul; we appreciated the contribu(cid:415)on from the AEC and

+i,

| hope you’ve been well. The Australian Electoral Commission has appreciated the productive engagement we’ve
had with Microsoft in the past, and while the date for the next Australian federal election is yet to be determined by
the government, we are keeping a close eye on developments in this ‘year of elections’ around the world,
particularly advancements in generative Al technology.

With that in mind, we are very interested in meeting with representatives from Microsoft’s Al team to learn more
about the following:

e Any observations and lessons learned from recent elections around the globe and how these experiences
are shaping your work on generative Al;

e How Microsoft is responding to electoral integrity risks when it comes to generative Al products like Copilot
and Azure, with a particular focus on how we can ensure the Australian public has access to timely and
accurate information about the electoral process;

e Confirming pathways for the Elecoral Integrity Assurance Taskforce (EIAT) and the AEC to flag potential
issues with you in relation to Australian federal electoral events and Al products like Copilot, and whether
this would differ from our existing pathway;

e Additionally, we’d also be interested in learning more about any of Microsoft’s approaches to both
watermarking but also identifying watermarked/Al-generated content.

Any assistance you can provide in directing us to the relevant teams to meet with would be much appreciated.

Hi 

I hope you have had a good week. I was touching base to follow up on a few details ahead of

In par(cid:415)cular, keen to have advice early next week on who from the EIAT will be a(cid:425)ending, as well as a desired

Dave would like to have (cid:415)me to prepare to address the areas of most interest to the Taskforce. He will have some 
slides to present so let us know if connec(cid:415)ng his computer to present will be possible or if he needs to prepare and 
send through in advance (less preferred as he has a lot of content he can dip into depending on where the

With regards to a (cid:415)me to meet 
in Singapore, I understand from 
and there will be lots of opportuni(cid:415)es to catch up – Dave looks forward to upda(cid:415)ng him on the conversa(cid:415)ons he will

Given 
people. We would propose a roundtable format of 60-90 minutes, depending on what you think would be most 
useful for the Taskforce, to comprise a brieﬁng from Dave then group discussion.  

We would welcome your team’s assistance with arranging this event if that is possible? We have an appropriate 
venue at our Canberra oﬃce on Na(cid:415)onal Circuit if needed, but are also happy to come to you or another agency.  

Separately to mee(cid:415)ng EIAT, I’d propose we arrange (cid:415)me for

Please feel free to give me a call if that is simpler to talk this through. I do hope we can make the most out of this

Hi 

 and 

Just wanted to close the loop on a suggested change to the schedule of Microso(cid:332) mee(cid:415)ngs here on 
Wednesday. If this has already been addressed, then please disregard. 

Given it has been suggested that the mee(cid:415)ngs with the CIOD (Tania Wilson’s area) and the EC (Jeﬀ) be 
combined into one mee(cid:415)ng for the Execu(cid:415)ve Leadership Team (ELT), I just wanted to make sure 

 and 

 had enough (cid:415)me to prepare/make adjustments and to conﬁrm what (cid:415)me the combined mee(cid:415)ng 

would take place. 

If the mee(cid:415)ngs are to be combined, then the agenda would include exis(cid:415)ng items prepared for the CIO 
and the following items that the EC is interested in: 

  Executive level briefing on Cyber threat landscape (MTAC/MSTIC insights) 
  Synthetic media - including AI and the practical application of detecting / content provenance + 

credentialing / Microsoft&#39;s &#39;AI for good lab&#39; initiative. 

  Mis/disinformation and Microsoft&#39;s efforts in this space, especially media and digital literacy.  
Insights from elections in other geographies, for example major common themes / concerns  
 

Potentially in addition to some, or all, of the following items suggested by 

 (time permitting): 

  support for electoral preparations from the technical/customer support perspective;  
  content credentialling and pilot next steps; 
  synthetic media and AI related harms, including advice on how to respond to incidents 
  overview of the Democracy Forward visit program including training for political campaigns and 

journalists; 

  update on implementation of the Tech Accord (as per correspondence this month)  
  any other topics of interest 

 – if not already aware, please let us know if any issues with this change.  

 – let me know if there is anything I can do to help. 

Cheers, 

| Assistant Director

Subject: [EXTERNAL] RSVPs and agenda items: in person brieﬁng from MSFT Democracy Forward at AEC 
[SEC=OFFICIAL] 

Good morning 

Thanks for checking in! 

A(cid:425)endance 
To date, we have had responses conﬁrming a(cid:425)endance from ASD (x1), ONI (x2) and DITRDCA (Infrastructure x 1). 
This is in addi(cid:415)on to AEC a(cid:425)endance ( x3-4). The rest have just been nil response rather than declined. I will send out 
a reminder today, along with an op(cid:415)on for those that can’t a(cid:425)end to submit ques(cid:415)ons/areas of interest which I can 
provide in a follow up email. 

Presen(cid:415)ng 
In rela(cid:415)on to presen(cid:415)ng, it won’t be an issue for us to grant Dave presenter permission to make life easy for him. I’ll 
check in with the people who know how to manage this to make sure it’s good to go for next Monday. 

Agenda items 
I haven’t put together a formal agenda, but can ﬂag that areas of interest will include the following: 

  What has Microso(cid:332) observed or learned in rela(cid:415)on to how electoral integrity* has been 

managed/maintained globally this year? 

o  What has happened that you were expec(cid:415)ng? 
o  What has surprised you (both posi(cid:415)ve and nega(cid:415)ve)? 
o  What could Australia learn from this? 

  How has Microso(cid:332) adapted its approach to elec(cid:415)ons based on what it has learned so far this year? 
  What are some useful (or terrible!) approaches to mi(cid:415)ga(cid:415)ng threats to electoral integrity that you have 

observed from other pla(cid:414)orms and/or from other electoral management bodies? 

  What are Microso(cid:332)’s insights (if any) into the Sovereign Ci(cid:415)zen movement? 
  How big an impact do you assess AI has had on elec(cid:415)ons to date? 

o  The existence of AI generated mis and disinforma(cid:415)on, deepfakes etc does not necessarily correlate 

with impact 

*We usually consider threats to electoral integrity in terms of cyber, mis/disinforma(cid:415)on, physical threats and foreign 
interference, but of course there is plenty of overlap between these four areas. 

Also, ONI reps queried whether your teams are aware of ONI’s ongoing discussions to contract support from 
Microso(cid:332) Threat Intelligence Center (MSTIC) and Microso(cid:332) Threat Analysis Center (MTAC). They didn’t ﬂag any 
ques(cid:415)ons or issues but might appreciate an update on whether you are aware of this and how the Democracy 
Forward team interacts with the other two. 

Lastly, Ma(cid:425) is copied in, but I will follow up to ﬂag that 
no doubt he would be keen for a chat. 

 will be at the conference in Singapore next week. I have 

I’ll check in with you again in the next day or two to update you on RSVPs and whether anyone has replied with a 
ques(cid:415)on or area of interest to cover. 

Many thanks,

Hi 

I hope you have had a good week. I was touching base to follow up on a few details ahead of

In par(cid:415)cular, keen to have advice early next week on who from the EIAT will be a(cid:425)ending, as well as a desired 
agenda.  

 would like to have (cid:415)me to prepare to address the areas of most interest to the Taskforce. He will have some 

slides to present so let us know if connec(cid:415)ng his computer to present will be possible or if he needs to prepare and 
send through in advance (less preferred as he has a lot of content he can dip into depending on where the 
discussion goes, if he can present he will keep that ﬂexibility). 

With regards to a (cid:415)me to meet Ma(cid:425)hew in Singapore, I understand from 
and there will be lots of opportuni(cid:415)es to catch up – 
have just had in Canberra, among other things. 

 looks forward to upda(cid:415)ng him on the conversa(cid:415)ons he will 

 that the conference is quite small

Hi 

, 

No worries at all, we understand how busy you and the team have been. Grateful for your help in 
coordinating the relevant team members and their availabilities. 

Are there any time zone considerations that we need to take into account? Unfortunately, not much 
availability in the last week of July, but we have 9-10am AEST as a possibility on either the 23rd or 24th of 
July.  

Let me know if either of those dates would work for you, as well as any team members you’d like to 
attend, and we can get a Teams calendar invite sent out to you.  

Many thanks,

I hope you and the team are well.  

My sincere apologies for the delay in responding to you. We would welcome the opportunity to continue 
to work closely and positively with the AEC in relation to election integrity.  

Do you have availability towards the end of July? 

We will pull together team members who are able to respond to these matters and prepare appropriate 
briefing materials. If you have anything else you would like us to cover please let me know.  

Look forward to working with you.

Hi 

,  

I hope you’ve been well. The Australian Electoral Commission has appreciated the productive 
engagement we’ve had with Google in the past, and while the date for the next Australian federal 
election is yet to be determined by the government, we are keeping a close eye on developments in this 
‘year of elections’ around the world, particularly advancements in generative AI technology. 

With that in mind, we are very interested in meeting with representatives from Google’s AI team to 
learn more about the following:  

 Any observations and lessons learned from recent elections around the globe and how 
these experiences are shaping your work on generative AI; 

 How Google is responding to electoral integrity risks when it comes to generative AI 
products like Gemini, with a particular focus on how we can ensure the Australian public has 
access to timely and accurate information about the electoral process; 

 A brief overview of SynthID including how it identifies AI-generated content; 

 Discussing pathways for the Elecoral Integrity Assurance Taskforce (EIAT) and the AEC to 
flag potential issues with you in relation to Australian federal electoral events and AI products 
like Gemini, and whether this would differ from our existing pathway.

Hi 

Thanks for your help in ﬁnding a (cid:415)me for this mee(cid:415)ng. As a guide, we are seeking to cover the following: 

1.  The AEC will provide an update on Australia’s electoral integrity environment and the work of the Electoral 

Integrity Assurance Taskforce (EIAT) 

2.  An update from Google and YouTube about observations and lessons learned from recent elections around 
the globe and how these experiences are shaping your work (especially as the US election draws nearer) 
3.  Discussion about how Google and YouTube are responding to electoral integrity risks, with a particular focus 
on how we can prevent the harassment and intimidation of electoral workers- particularly where this is 
posted online 

4.  Discussion of the FE24/25 version of the Online Platform Scenarios, which, although similar to the 

Referendum scenarios, has had some updates 

5.  Any other updates Google/YouTube would like to cover, e.g. developments in genAI 

Please let me know if you would like to discuss or clarify any of this prior to the meeting- I’d be very happy 
to do so. 

Cheers,

Hi 

, 

Thanks so much for sharing this! Our strong preference would be for videos that fit the YT format - 
so either longform or Shorts but ideally not square - as well as content made specifically for the 
upcoming election in 2025. 

Will check in with you closer to the date to finalise the list. 

Thanks again!

Hey

No worries — completely understand that. Would be a nice thing to happen but not a roadblock in my eyes if
unachievable.

Great — very happy to create a bespoke playlist. Is there a deadline you would ideally like this by? If you have
any thoughts or preferences of what should be included in the playlist please let us know. Otherwise, we&#39;ll
just go with what we think is best.

Thanks so much for getting this back over to us - really appreciate it.

 

For the playlist, we&#39;re happy to lean on your preference for whichever content you&#39;re most
wanting to surface with voters BMJ mentioned that he&#39;d be interested in creating a
bespoke playlist as current playlists are very broad and include more specialised content

such as ). My
recommendation would be to collate a bespoke playlist of either your most widely relevant
or best performing videos., and I&#39;m more than happy to work with you on curating this!

 

Let me know what you think and thanks again for your collaboration on this!

Good morning

Bringing to your attention a video with 75k+ views that our Social Media Team reported yesterday:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xcrxUCoiPIU 

From 5:18 it claims that there will be digital ID requirements for FE25, which is incorrect. Our team 
referred this under ‘misinformation’ as follows: 

The video’s claim that “digital identity verification for voting” has been introduced for the 2025 federal 
election is false. ID is not required when voting in Australian federal elections, and there have been no 
recent changes in this area. 

The erroneous claim presents the following risks: 

 Disenfranchising Australian voters who view the video and believe they won’t be able to vote due to 
not having a digital ID. (Or that they may not be able to vote if they haven’t linked a digital ID to 
their enrolment). 

 Damaging the perceived integrity of Australian federal elections due to the implication voter privacy 

may be compromised. 

As of this morning it’s still up/unlabelled/unmoderated but it was only referred yesterday afternoon. 

The election hasn’t been called yet, but the social media team are already feeling it! 

Also , thanks for the link you shared after our meeting earlier this week. That page is helpful – I think we 
believed it was more complicated than it was.

Jeff Pope APM  
Acting Electoral Commissioner  
Australian Electoral Commission  
10-12 Mort Street 
Canberra ACT 2600 

Dear Acting Commissioner 

Thank you for your letter of December 17, 2024 regarding Google&#39;s commitment to the Tech Accord to Combat 
Deceptive Use of AI in 2024 Elections and its relevance to Australia’s upcoming federal election. We appreciate the 
Australian Electoral Commission&#39;s (AEC) ongoing collaboration with online platforms and share your commitment to 
maintaining public trust in Australia&#39;s democratic processes. Google recognises the potential risks AI poses to electoral 
integrity and welcomes the opportunity to provide an update on our efforts to address these challenges. 

Google has long been dedicated to supporting democratic processes by: 

●  Surfacing high-quality information to voters 
●  Safeguarding our platforms from abuse, and 
●  Equipping campaigns with best-in-class security tools and training. 

These three pillars are fundamental to maintaining public trust in elections and include our platforms and services 
providing the following: 

●  Google promotes information on how to vote on Google Search&#39;s landing page to increase voter awareness 

and democratic participation. 

●  YouTube prominently surfaces content from authoritative sources on the homepage, in search results, and the 

&#34;Up Next&#34; panel for election news and information. 

●  Google monitors and tackles coordinated influence operations through the Google Threat Intelligence group, 
which includes intelligence and threat response across Google’s Threat Analysis Group, Cloud Security and 
Mandiant teams. 

●  For over a decade, Google has leveraged machine learning classifiers and AI to identify and remove content 

that violates policies regarding manipulated media, hate and harassment, incitement to violence, and 
demonstrably false claims that could undermine democratic processes. 

●  Google offers free security services like the Advanced Protection Program and Project Shield to high-risk users 
such as campaigners and journalists to ensure they have additional account security protections in place. 

Addressing AI-Related Misinformation 

We understand the AEC&#39;s concerns regarding the use of AI to spread election-related misinformation and 
disinformation, including deepfakes and coordinated inauthentic behaviour. Google has implemented several 
measures to mitigate these risks across our products and services: 

●  AI and Generative AI policies: Google has policies that address misinformation and disinformation in the 
context of AI.  For example, YouTube&#39;s misinformation policies prohibit technically manipulated content that 
misleads users and could pose a serious risk of egregious harm.  

 Page 1 of 3


--- Page 38 ---

●  Ads disclosures: Google requires advertisers to disclose when their election ads include synthetic content 
that inauthentically depicts real or realistic-looking people or events. This policy applies to image, video, and 
audio content. Google&#39;s ads policies already prohibit the use of manipulated media to mislead people, such as 
deep fakes or doctored content. 

●  Content labels on YouTube: YouTube requires creators to disclose when they&#39;ve created realistic altered or 
synthetic content and displays a label indicating that the content is synthetic. For election-related content, 
YouTube displays a prominent label on the video player for added transparency. 

●  Responsible approach to Generative AI products: Google has prioritised testing across safety risks, 
including misinformation, for Generative AI products like Gemini. Google has restricted the types of 
election-related queries for which Gemini will return responses. 

●  Watermarking: Google attaches invisible watermarks to imagery generated by Google&#39;s models using 

SynthID, a watermarking technology developed by Google DeepMind. 

●  Providing users with additional context: &#34;About this image&#34; in Search helps people assess the credibility and 
context of images found online. The double-check feature in Gemini enables people to evaluate whether 
there&#39;s content across the web to substantiate a Gemini response. 

Progress Against the Tech Accord Commitments 

Google was among the original signatories of the Tech Accord to Combat Deceptive Use of AI in 2024 Elections. In line 
with our commitments, we have taken steps across our products to reduce the risks that deceptive AI election content 
may pose to the integrity of electoral processes. These steps include: 

●  Developing Model Cards to promote transparency and a shared understanding of AI models 
●  Addressing harmful content through Google&#39;s AI Prohibited Use Policy 
●  Proactively testing systems using AI-Assisted Red Teaming 
●  Restricting responses for election-related queries across many Generative AI consumer apps and experiences 
●  Expanding the SynthID watermarking toolkit to more Generative AI tools and more forms of media 
●  Requiring election advertisers to prominently disclose when their ads include realistic synthetic content 
●  Adding Google-generated disclosures for some YouTube Election Ads formats, and 
●  Actively exploring ways to incorporate Content Credentials into our own products and services, including Ads, 

Search, and YouTube, as a Steering Committee member of the C2PA Coalition and Standard. 

Collaboration and Transparency 

Google is committed to transparency and collaboration with industry, government, and civil society. We actively share 
our learnings and expertise with researchers and others in the industry. We engage and collaborate with organisations 
such as the Partnership on AI, ML Commons, and the Frontier Model Forum. We also support the Global Fact Check 
Fund and numerous civil society, research, and media literacy efforts. 

Looking Ahead 

Google&#39;s efforts around elections are not limited to a specific timeframe or region. We will continue to support and 
protect elections around the world and in Australia by: 

●  Surfacing high-quality information to voters 
●  Safeguarding our platforms from abuse 
●  Equipping campaigns with best-in-class security tools and training 
●  Applying new learnings to improve our protections for harmful content and create trustworthy experiences 
●  Leveraging machine learning classifiers and AI to identify and remove content that violates our policies, and 
●  Taking a principled and responsible approach to introducing generative AI products.

We are dedicated to working with the AEC to address the challenges posed by Al and uphold the Australian public&#39;s
trust in democratic processes and institutions. We value our ongoing relationship and have welcomed the frequent
and ongoing engagement with members of the AEC from the Defending Democracy Unit and beyond. We will continue
to work closely with the AEC to ensure these efforts are understood and that appropriate pathways for escalation and
engagement are in place ahead of the upcoming Federal Election.

We look forward to continuing our collaboration.

Hi

Thank you so much for following up on your email and our apologies for the delayed response in getting 
back to you. You’re spot on in that the decks have been very full over the last few weeks with the 
legislative and reform agenda.  

We would be delighted to connect before the break. Perhaps we try for 16, 17 or 18. Are those times still 
workable from your end?  

Cheers,

Subject: Action items from October meeting, including proposed dates for December meeting 

Good afternoon 

, 

I hope this email finds you both well and you’re both on track for a relaxing Christmas break. I thought it 
would be good to follow up on a few action items from our last meeting before December arrives, as 
follows. 

Information session 

 

- at our last meeting you kindly offered to set up an information quality session to outline how 
Google search worked, including an element on searches in Gemini. We would like to take you up 
on that offer.  

o  Please let me know what time frames/notice you need to set this up and I would be happy 

to set up some meeting invites 

o  If we work a couple of weeks in advance, most of our working level attendees will be free to 

attend 

Gemini’s incorrect answer about enrolling to vote 

 

- on 23 October we flagged that Gemini was producing an incorrect answer to the question 
“Can I be enrolled to vote if I haven’t completed and enrolment form?”. It appears that Gemini 
now declines to respond this prompt, instead providing the scripted answer in relation to not 
being able to help with elections. I’m not sure if this is based on action you have taken in the 
background, if so, thanks and noted! 

  For a gold star from us it would be great if Gemini provided a link to the AEC’s website when 

Australian users submit queries about elections, although there is some nuance to this given we 
have state electoral management bodies to consider too. We also understand these things are not 
always as easy as they sound. Happy to discuss at our next meeting if this is something you think 
could be pursued. 

Next meeting - December 2024 

  At our last meeting on 23 October, it was agreed it would be useful to set up a post US election 

meeting before we all break for Christmas. Available times in December include: 

o  Monday, 16 December                   9.30am to 11.00am 
o  Monday, 16 December                   1pm to 2pm 

3

s47Fs47Fs47Fs47F


--- Page 43 ---

o  Tuesday, 17 December                   1pm to 2pm 
o  Wednesday, 18 December            9.30am to 10.30am 
o  Wednesday, 18 December            1pm to 2pm 
o  Friday, 20 December                       9.30am to 12pm 
o  Friday, 20 December                       1pm to 2pm 

No problem if this is not a good week in the lead up to Christmas, just give me a steer on a better 
week and I’ll consult calendars accordingly. 

  We will send out an agenda prior the next meeting but note the following from our last meeting. 

o 

o 

 offered to brief on Google’s approach to AI in elections after gaining insight from 

the US presidential election on 5 November 

 offered to provide more information about how content provenance works on 

content uploaded to YouTube at next meeting 

o  Google and YouTube to provide information and insights into Sovereign Citizen promotion 

of misinformation/disinformation respective platforms 

o  Google and YouTube support for the next Australian federal election 
o  AEC to share trends in the election information environment with Google and YouTube 

Lastly, no doubt you are already aware of the Electoral Legislation Amendment (Electoral Reform) Bill 
2024 currently being considered. In case you are not already aware, there is a proposed amendment to 
section 348 (Control of behaviour at polling booths etc.) of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 that 
provides: 

(1A) A person commits an offence if:  

(a)          the person makes an audio or video recording in premises to which this section 
applies; and 

(b)          the recording is made without the permission of the person in charge of the 
premises; and  

(c)           the making of the recording constitutes a contravention of paragraph 348(1)(a); 
and  

(d)          the person:  

(i)            publishes the whole or a part of the recording; or  

(ii)           causes to be published the whole or a part of the recording.  

Penalty: 5 penalty units.

--- Page 44 ---

Essentially, it will be an offence to get your phone out and video or audio record in a polling place or 
counting centre and post it online without the permission of the officer in charge. Some of the content 
posted online that the AEC was concerned about during past events would be covered by this if/when it 
enacted. Flagging now ahead of our next meeting for discussion. 

Apologies for the lengthy email. Please let me know if you would like to discuss or receive further 
information.

Hi

No worries at all, we understand how busy you and the team have been. Grateful for your help in coordinating the 
relevant team members and their availabilities. 

Are there any time zone considerations that we need to take into account? Unfortunately, not much availability in 
the last week of July, but we have 9-10am AEST as a possibility on either the 23rd or 24th of July.  

Let me know if either of those dates would work for you, as well as any team members you’d like to attend, and we 
can get a Teams calendar invite sent out to you.  

Many thanks, 

 (she/her) | A/g Assistant Director

I hope you’ve been well. The Australian Electoral Commission has appreciated the productive 
engagement we’ve had with Google in the past, and while the date for the next Australian federal 
election is yet to be determined by the government, we are keeping a close eye on developments in this 
‘year of elections’ around the world, particularly advancements in generative AI technology. 

With that in mind, we are very interested in meeting with representatives from Google’s AI team to 
learn more about the following:  

 Any observations and lessons learned from recent elections around the globe and how 
these experiences are shaping your work on generative AI; 

 How Google is responding to electoral integrity risks when it comes to generative AI 
products like Gemini, with a particular focus on how we can ensure the Australian public has 
access to timely and accurate information about the electoral process; 

 A brief overview of SynthID including how it identifies AI-generated content; 

 Discussing pathways for the Elecoral Integrity Assurance Taskforce (EIAT) and the AEC to flag 
potential issues with you in relation to Australian federal electoral events and AI products like 
Gemini, and whether this would differ from our existing pathway. 

Any assistance you can provide in directing us to the relevant teams to meet with would be much 
appreciated.  

Kind regards,

Good morning 

 and 

We hope this email finds you well! 

As you would be aware, the AEC is preparing for the next federal election (FE24/25); while the date is 
yet to be determined by government, it could be called at any time with the latest date for it to be held 
being in May 2025. We would therefore like to arrange a meeting with you (and/or appropriate 
representatives as you see fit) in preparation. 

Given you will likely be quite busy in the lead up to the US Presidential election on 5 November, we 
would like to propose a meeting this month. 

At this meeting we would be interested in covering: 

 an update from the AEC on Australia’s electoral integrity environment 

 an update from Google/YouTube about your observations and lessons learned from 
recent elections around the globe and how these experiences are shaping your work 

 how Google/YouTube are responding to electoral integrity risks, with a particular 
focus on how we can ensure the Australian public has access to timely and accurate 
information about the electoral process 

 confirming the options and/or escalation pathways for the EIAT and the AEC to flag 
potential issues with Google/YouTube in relation to Australian federal electoral 
events 

 discuss the (FE24/25) version of the Online Platform Scenarios, which, although 
similar to the Referendum scenarios, has had some updates 

Grateful if you could please advise which (if any) of the following dates would be suitable for a 
September meeting.  

We would be aiming for a one-hour window within the following times.

                    <h2>Document Summary</h2>
<p>This document comprises a series of email exchanges and meeting invitations between the Australian Electoral Commission's (AEC) Defending Democracy Unit (DDU) and Electoral Integrity Assurance Taskforce (EIAT), and representatives from Google and YouTube. The correspondence, spanning from June 2024 to March 2025, details ongoing collaborative efforts focused on safeguarding electoral integrity ahead of the 2025 Federal Election (FE25). Key discussions revolve around:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Scheduled Engagements:</strong> Multiple meetings and check-ins are planned and confirmed, indicating a structured and continuous dialogue.</li>
<li><strong>AI and Misinformation:</strong> Deep dives into Google's approach to Artificial Intelligence (AI) in elections, including lessons from the US presidential election, content provenance, AI-generated content (AIGC) detection (e.g., SynthID), and policies regarding synthetic content and deepfakes.</li>
<li><strong>Content Moderation &amp; Escalation:</strong> Discussions on established referral and escalation pathways for problematic content, exemplified by the successful removal of a YouTube video falsely claiming digital ID requirements for FE25.</li>
<li><strong>Media Literacy and Authoritative Information:</strong> Collaboration on YouTube's 2025 election campaign, including AEC feedback on promotional creative and the creation of bespoke playlists to promote accurate electoral information and media literacy initiatives (e.g., "Hit Pause" campaign).</li>
<li><strong>Security &amp; Policy Updates:</strong> Google outlines its broader commitment to electoral integrity, including surfacing high-quality information, safeguarding platforms from abuse, offering cybersecurity tools (e.g., Advanced Protection Program, Project Shield), and adhering to initiatives like the Tech Accord to Combat Deceptive Use of AI.</li>
<li><strong>Challenges:</strong> Specific issues addressed include misinformation related to "Sovereign Citizen" movements and concerns regarding online harassment of electoral workers. The AEC also flags proposed legislative changes impacting recording in polling places.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Relevance to FOI Request</h2>
<p>This document is highly relevant to the FOI request as it directly demonstrates the "extensive interactions" and "formal letters" between the AEC and Google/YouTube. It provides concrete examples of how these platforms are "collaborating with the AEC's Electoral Integrity Assurance Taskforce (EIAT) and Defending Democracy Unit (DDU)" to safeguard FE25. Specifically, it reveals:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Countering Misinformation and Disinformation:</strong> Direct engagement on identifying and removing false content (e.g., digital ID claims) and discussions about specific misinformation narratives (Sovereign Citizen).</li>
<li><strong>Managing AI-Generated Content (AIGC):</strong> A central theme, with explicit agenda items and detailed responses from Google on detection (SynthID), labeling, provenance initiatives, policy updates (e.g., AI content disclosure, Gemini restrictions), and adherence to the Tech Accord.</li>
<li><strong>Applying Lessons from Global Elections:</strong> A recurring agenda point, confirming that global electoral experiences, particularly regarding AI, are actively informing FE25 preparations.</li>
<li><strong>Streamlining Referral and Escalation Pathways:</strong> Explicit confirmation and practical application of direct communication channels for flagging problematic content.</li>
<li><strong>Supporting Media Literacy Campaigns:</strong> Detailed collaboration on YouTube's public information campaigns and the creation of bespoke AEC content to promote accurate information.</li>
<li><strong>Platform Preparedness:</strong> Evidence of Google/YouTube updating policies, offering cybersecurity tools, and establishing dedicated working groups to ensure a secure and credible information environment for FE25.</li>

Dear Acting Commissioner,

Thank you for the Australian Electoral Commission&#39;s (AEC’s) ongoing engagement with TikTok
and for recently joining the platform to reach over 9.5 million Australian users.

We are protecting the integrity of our platform during the upcoming Australian Federal
election, including removing content that violates our strict Community Guidelines and
supporting civic and electoral integrity. As emphasised in our recent direct engagement with
the Australian Electoral Commission, including members of the Electoral Integrity Taskforce,
we continue to invest in our Trust &amp; Safety function, maintain our fact-checking infrastructure,
including in Australia, and treat Federal elections with the seriousness they warrant, noting
many of the global concerns you raise.

As part of this ongoing work, in 2024 we updated our Civic and Election Integrity policies to
provide greater clarity around protections for election workers, or observers, who might face
intimidation or harassment in the course of these critical events. We also continue to refine
our AI-Generated Content (AIGC) policies to respond to emerging trends and threats. These
policies now require users to label AIGC content, using in-app features, and we also apply
auto-labelling ourselves. We recognise that even when appropriately labelled, AIGC and edited
media may still be harmful. We do not allow content that shares or shows fake authoritative
sources or crisis events, or falsely shows public figures in certain contexts including being
bullied, making an endorsement, or being endorsed. In these instances, we will remove the
violative content through proactive moderation, user reports, and reports as escalated by the
AEC.

Noting the global threat landscape, including around elections, in 2024 we also expanded our
state-affiliated media policies to further address state-affiliated media accounts that attempt
to reach communities outside their home country on current global events and affairs. When


--- Page 5 ---

we  identify  these  accounts,  they  will  become  ineligible  for  recommendation,  which  means 
their  content  won&#39;t  appear  in  the  For  You  feed  -  the  primary  way  TikTok  users  discover 
content. In addition, if these accounts advertise on our platform, they will not be allowed to 

advertise  outside  of  the  country  with  which  they  are  primarily  affiliated.  Importantly,  in 
relation to Covert Influence Operations, in 2024, we also introduced monthly public reporting, 
which we publish on our Transparency Centre.1 These reports disclose the detection source, 
the  target  location(s)  of  such  operations,  the  number  of  accounts  in  a  network,  and  the 
number of followers those accounts might have had. We leverage our global team&#39;s expertise 

and insights in relation to any potential threats in Australia and, where we detect these, we 
disclose them.  

For  the  upcoming  federal  election  in  Australia,  TikTok  has  established  a  dedicated  core 
working group to assess and respond to reports we receive from the AEC, ensure moderation 

systems  are  up-to-date,  and  adapt  to  unfolding  events  as  they  might  emerge  during  the 
electoral period (including content related trends, whether concerning AICG or other types of 
content).  

We have taken specific actions to support the safety and integrity of the 2025 Federal Election, 

including:  

1.  Upholding our prohibition on paid political advertising on-platform. This includes both 
traditional  paid  advertisements  and  creators  receiving  compensation  to  support  or 
oppose a candidate. 

2.  Maintaining an active TikTok reporting portal access for the AEC to report content of 

concern.  

3.  Providing re-direction, in-app, to authoritative election-related information for content 
concerning  the  federal  election,  including  linking  to  the  AEC&#39;s  website  and  TikTok 
account. 

4.  Conducting  impersonation  sweeps  for  accounts  that  are  verified  as  belonging  to 
Australian political candidates, including existing elected Members and Senators, with 
appropriate enforcement action taken as a result.  

5.  Issuing policy guidance specific to the election for our moderation system, including 

guidance that covers AIGC.  

6.  Establishing a pathway for communication with other government agencies, including 
as it concerns the safety of Members of Parliament, to enable a timely response to 
issues that may arise in the Australian community during the electoral period.

Good morning

Ahead of our mee(cid:415)ng today at 1pm , I just wanted to give you the heads up about a couple of ques(cid:415)ons the EIAT TF 
Chair, Ma(cid:425) Haigh, will ask you over the course of the update from the AEC/EIAT.  

  What are some of the posi(cid:415)ve ways TikTok has been used during an elec(cid:415)on? (For example, community 
educa(cid:415)on campaigns, encouraging people to enrol and to vote. We note some reputable sources such as 
the ABC have posted ‘How To Vote’ videos.) 

  Does the TikTok algorithm give priority to authorita(cid:415)ve sources of informa(cid:415)on about an elec(cid:415)on? For 

example, AEC, ABC and other authorita(cid:415)ve sources of informa(cid:415)on. 

  Does TikTok have any elec(cid:415)on speciﬁc ﬁlters (no(cid:415)ng Snap has something, but this may work diﬀerently on 

TikTok) 

  Have referral pathways changed since the 2023 referendum? 
  Have there been any changes to TikTok’s processes or referral pathways for legal referrals? 
  We’re aware that the use of AI to enable the spread of mis and disinforma(cid:415)on remains an existen(cid:415)al 
challenge for everyone in the online environment, including TikTok. Given reports of AI enabled 
misinforma(cid:415)on on TikTok (Network of TikTok accounts using AI to spread poli(cid:415)cal misinforma(cid:415)on, report 
ﬁnds | Mashable , TikTok Content Farms Use AI Voiceovers to Mass-Produce Poli(cid:415)cal Misinforma(cid:415)on - 
NewsGuard) during last year’s elec(cid:415)ons: 

o  What did TikTok learn from this and has this ben the catalyst for any changes? 
o  What guardrails will TikTok have in place for the Australian elec(cid:415)on? 

I trust most of these will be pre(cid:425)y straight forward but wanted to give you a bit of advance no(cid:415)ce. Apologies its 
arriving on the day of the mee(cid:415)ng but I had to take some unforeseen leave last week. 

Please let me know if you any ques(cid:415)on or would like any further context. Otherwise, we will see you at 1pm. 

Cheers,

Hi there  

Thanks so much for your email, we&#39;d be happy to meet with you all. But we do have some restrained 
availability over the few weeks, and teams based in Singapore so later in the day is preferred for us. 

If it&#39;s possible to push the meeting until the second last week of September? Alternatively, the week 
starting 8 October would be easier again for us.  

Does your team have availability then?

Good morning 

We hope this email finds you well. 

As you would be aware, the AEC is preparing for the next federal election (FE24/25); while the date is yet 
to be determined by government, it could be called at any time with the latest date for it to be held 
being in May 2025. We would therefore like to arrange a meeting with you (and/or appropriate 
representatives as you see fit) in preparation. 

Given you will likely be quite busy in the lead up to the US Presidential election on 5 November, we 
would like to propose a meeting this month. 

At this meeting we would be interested in covering: 

 an update from the AEC on Australia’s electoral integrity environment 

 an update from TikTok about your observations and lessons learned from recent 
elections around the globe and how these experiences are shaping your work

s 47Fs 47Fs 47Es 47Es 47Fs 47Fs 47Fs 47Fs47F

 how TikTok are responding to electoral integrity risks, with a particular focus on how 
we can ensure the Australian public has access to timely and accurate information 
about the electoral process 

 confirming the options and/or escalation pathways for the EIAT and the AEC to flag 
potential issues with TikTok in relation to Australian federal electoral events 

 discuss the (FE24/25) version of the Online Platform Scenarios, which, although 
similar to the Referendum scenarios, has had some updates 

Grateful if you could please advise which (if any) of the following dates would be suitable for a 
September meeting.  

We would be aiming for a one-hour window within the following times. 

Tuesday, 17 September 8am to 9.30am 

Wednesday, 18 September 8am to 10am 

Thursday, 19 September 8am to 9.30am 

Friday, 20 September 8am to 9.30am 

Very happy to discuss further if needed.

If you were able to please review the copy, and provide any feedback? It is very similar to the 2022 hub 
that we partnered on, so hoping this should be a relatively straight forward review. Also chasing the best 
resource for the last category in the copy, I reviewed your website today but couldn&#39;t see a neat page for 
the final category to link to.

Stop and consider 

During an election, people or groups may try to influence the way you vote. 

Stop and consider what you’re seeing, hearing or reading. Check multiple sources of information, 
particularly if you’re not sure of the information&#39;s authenticity. For information about the Australian 
federal election - including voting processes and your rights and obligations under Australian law - go to 
the AEC.  

  Tips to ‘stop and consider’  
 

Learn about the voting process  

Ways to vote 
Australia has some of the best voting options in the world.  

If you can vote on election day, then that is what you should do. If you can’t make it on election day you 
can vote during the two-week early voting period – either in-person or via post. Plan your vote according 
to your circumstances. 

  Election day: in your local area or at dedicated interstate voting centres.  

  Pre-polling: in-person at an early voting centre - anywhere around Australia or at an overseas 

voting centre 

  Mobile voting: via a mobile voting team visiting remote communities, residential care facilities, 

some hospitals and a range of other locations of need.    

  Postal voting: if you can&#39;t make it to a voting centre 

Head here for more information and options. 

Preferential voting 
Voting in the federal election is compulsory for all Australian citizens aged 18+ on the electoral roll. Know 
how the Australian preferential voting system works before you head to a voting centre 

Where to vote 
Voting locations will be available in the week before the voting period starts.  

-  Find your federal electoral division 
-  Find my nearest voting centre

                    <h3>Document Summary</h3>
<p>This document compiles email exchanges and a formal letter between the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) (specifically its Defending Democracy Unit (DDU), Electoral Integrity Assurance Taskforce (EIAT), and Commissioner's Office) and TikTok representatives, illustrating their ongoing collaboration to safeguard electoral integrity for the 2025 Federal Election (FE25).</p>
<p><strong>Key Interactions and Discussions:</strong><br />
*   <strong>September-October 2024:</strong> Initial meetings were scheduled and held to discuss AEC updates on Australia's electoral integrity environment, TikTok's observations and lessons from global elections, responses to electoral integrity risks, and the confirmation of referral and escalation pathways. The "Online Platform Scenarios" for FE24/25 were also on the agenda.<br />
*   <strong>January-February 2025:</strong> Further meetings were planned and executed, with the AEC posing specific questions to TikTok. These included queries about positive uses of the platform for electoral education, the algorithm's prioritisation of authoritative information (like the AEC), election-specific filters, changes to referral pathways (including legal referrals) since the 2023 referendum, and crucial lessons learned/guardrails for AI-enabled misinformation observed in previous elections.<br />
*   <strong>February 2025:</strong> Collaboration on developing an "in-app" election information hub. TikTok proposed draft text for a "2025 Australian Election guide" to be included in its app, which the AEC's Media &amp; Digital Engagement team reviewed and approved, aiming to direct users to authoritative AEC information on voting processes and rights.<br />
*   <strong>March 2025:</strong> TikTok sent a formal letter to the AEC Acting Commissioner outlining its comprehensive commitment to protecting platform integrity for FE25.</p>
<p><strong>TikTok's Commitments and Actions Highlighted:</strong><br />
*   <strong>Policy Updates:</strong> Refined Civic and Election Integrity policies to protect election workers and updated AI-Generated Content (AIGC) policies to require user and auto-labelling of AIGC, with a prohibition on harmful AIGC (e.g., fake authoritative sources, crisis events, false public figure endorsements).<br />
*   <strong>Content Moderation &amp; Trust &amp; Safety:</strong> Ongoing investment in Trust &amp; Safety functions, maintaining fact-checking infrastructure in Australia, and committing to removing violative content through proactive moderation, user reports, and AEC escalations.<br />
*   <strong>Combating Malign Influence:</strong> Expanded state-affiliated media policies (restricting "For You" feed recommendations and advertising outside their home country) and introduced monthly public reporting on Covert Influence Operations via its Transparency Centre.<br />
*   <strong>Operational Readiness for FE25:</strong> Established a dedicated core working group to assess AEC reports, update moderation systems, and adapt to emerging content trends during the election period.<br />
*   <strong>Specific Electoral Integrity Measures:</strong><br />
    *   Maintaining a prohibition on paid political advertising.<br />
    *   Providing active reporting portal access for the AEC to flag content of concern.<br />
    *   Implementing in-app redirection to authoritative AEC election information (website and TikTok account).<br />
    *   Conducting impersonation sweeps for verified Australian political candidates.<br />
    *   Issuing election-specific policy guidance for its moderation system, including for AIGC.<br />
    *   Establishing a communication pathway with other government agencies for timely responses to issues affecting public figures (e.g., Members of Parliament).</p>

It lists over 60 individual documents, including meeting invitations, confirmations, follow-up emails, formal letters, and briefing notes, spanning interactions with Google/YouTube, Meta (Facebook/Instagram), Microsoft/LinkedIn, X (formerly Twitter), and TikTok.\n\nThe entries indicate extensive engagement on topics such as:\n*   **Meeting Coordination:** Numerous entries detail the scheduling, cancellation, and confirmation of meetings between the AEC's Electoral Integrity Assurance Taskforce (EIAT) and Defending Democracy Unit (DDU) with platform representatives.\n*   **Content Management & Policy:** Specific mentions include a \"YouTube Video Reported Yesterday,\" a \"Request for Information: Blocking Microsoft AI Image Generation of Specific AEC Employees,\" and TikTok's \"Commitment to the AI Election\u2019s Accord\" and a \"Proposed \u2018In App\u2019 Information Hub.\"\n*   **Briefings and Information Sharing:** References to \"Microsoft Digital Defense Report 2024,\" \"Microsoft Brief for EIAT,\" and \"NEW MTAC Report on US Election\" demonstrate information exchange on electoral integrity and security.\n*   **Global Lessons:** An entry related to \"Russian-linked Influence Efforts in UK Election\" highlights the AEC's interest in applying insights from international electoral contexts.\n\nThe majority of documents listed show a \"Partial Access\" decision, indicating redactions were applied, while one attachment was \"Released in Full.\" A set of documents (55-63) were marked \"Refuse Access\" under S 37 exemption.\n\n**Relevance to the FOI Request:**\n\nThis document is highly relevant as it directly addresses the core of the FOI request. It provides concrete evidence of the \"extensive interactions\" between the AEC and the specified major online platforms (Google/YouTube, Meta, Microsoft/LinkedIn, TikTok, and additionally X) to safeguard electoral integrity ahead of the 2025 Federal Election.\n\nSpecifically, it demonstrates:\n*   **Active Engagement:** The sheer volume and variety of listed interactions confirm the ongoing collaboration between the AEC's EIAT and DDU and the platforms.\n*   **Focus on Key Themes:** Document titles explicitly reference concerns around AI-generated content (AI Election's Accord, AI Image Generation), the need for streamlined referral pathways (reported YouTube video), and the application of lessons from global elections (UK, US election influence efforts).\n*   **Operational Aspects:** The entries reflect the practical nature of this collaboration, including the coordination of dedicated meetings and the exchange of information vital for maintaining a secure and credible information environment.", "model": "gemini-2.5-flash", "generated_at": "2025-06-23T23:01:35.016072", "source_hash": "741f627318e25ebc79210a7102df1dc4b67b7683528fffacd705263cfad11129", "raw_response_path": "data/llm_responses/LEX7205__per_file__balanced__lex7205-schedule.pdf__20250623T230135.json", "output_tokens": 556, "prompt_tokens": 3686, "total_tokens": 5597, "summary_length": 2832}, "left_leaning": {"text": "This document, an index of FOI releases detailing interactions between the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) and global tech giants, profoundly highlights a left-leaning concern regarding the privatization of democratic functions. It meticulously lists numerous meetings, engagements, and follow-ups with X, Google/YouTube, Meta, Microsoft, LinkedIn, and TikTok, explicitly referencing initiatives like \"Microsoft Democracy Forward\" and the AEC's \"Electoral Integrity Assurance Team (EIAT).\" This extensive engagement signals a deeply troubling outsourcing of core democratic processes, including election integrity, to private, for-profit corporations, thereby reinforcing concentrated corporate power and wealth at the expense of public governance.\n\nThe overwhelming prevalence of \"Partial Access\" and \"Refuse Access\" decisions for nearly every listed document, citing exemptions such as S22, S47E(d), S47F(1), and particularly S37 (for \"Redacted subject line\" entries), epitomizes a profound lack of transparency. This heavy redaction, justified by vague \"irrelevant information\" or \"protection of public safety\" claims, effectively obscures the precise nature and extent of these critical interactions, creating a black box around decisions impacting public discourse. From a left-leaning perspective, this lack of transparency fosters an environment ripe for state-sanctioned censorship by proxy, where the lines between public oversight and corporate control over information become dangerously blurred.\n\nSpecific entries like \"YouTube Video Reported Yesterday\" and \"Request for Information: Blocking Microsoft AI Image Generation of Specific AEC Employees\" indicate an active role in content management and information control. When such functions are delegated to private entities with their own commercial interests, it directly undermines democratic accountability and poses a significant threat to civil liberties, particularly freedom of speech. The reliance on these tech giants represents a fundamental deviation from publicly governed democratic processes, ceding crucial control over public discourse to unelected corporations and eroding the foundations of a truly equitable and transparent electoral system.", "model": "gemini-2.5-flash", "generated_at": "2025-06-21T22:43:34.916990", "source_hash": "a43a23cf106372de168141a5db2d8630261dbd466c8c37a4db9e3f2935d4593e", "raw_response_path": "data/llm_responses/LEX7205__per_file__left_leaning__lex7205-schedule.pdf__20250621T224334.json", "output_tokens": 392, "prompt_tokens": 3693, "total_tokens": 5109, "summary_length": 2229}, "right_leaning": {"text": "This document list, obtained through Freedom of Information, starkly reveals the Australian Electoral Commission's (AEC) pervasive and concerning pattern of collaboration with major tech platforms, including Google/YouTube, Microsoft, LinkedIn, X, and TikTok. From a right-leaning perspective, this deep engagement exemplifies alarming government overreach into the digital sphere, threatening market freedom and free speech under the guise of \"electoral integrity.\"\n\nThe sheer volume of meetings and communications, evidenced by numerous entries like \"EIAT Meeting with X Representatives,\" \"AEC Meeting with Google and YouTube,\" and extensive engagements with Microsoft and TikTok, demonstrates a coordinated effort by a government agency to exert influence over private digital platforms. This undermines market freedom by pressuring tech companies to align with government directives on content management, rather than operating solely on market principles or existing legal frameworks.\n\nSpecific entries, such as \"Request for Information: Blocking Microsoft AI Image Generation of Specific AEC Employees\" and \"For Action: LinkedIn Meeting Placeholder and List of AEC Names to Block from AI Tools,\" highlight a disturbing desire for the AEC to control or suppress digital content, even personal representations, via private companies. This constitutes a direct threat to individual liberty and free speech, as government bodies appear to be dictating what can and cannot be seen or discussed online. The \"FOR INFO: YouTube Video Reported Yesterday\" entry further suggests the AEC is actively involved in flagging or influencing the removal of content, expanding its role far beyond traditional election administration into digital censorship.\n\nMoreover, the consistent application of \"Partial Access\" or \"Refuse Access\" for nearly all documents, citing numerous exemptions including S22, S47E(d), S47F(1), S37, and S47G, raises serious red flags regarding transparency and accountability. The use of S37, related to law enforcement and public safety, to withhold information about these collaborations implies a level of sensitivity that suggests more than routine administrative discussions. This opaqueness indicates a taxpayer-funded operation largely operating in the shadows, where an increasingly interventionist government is extending its reach into digital public discourse without sufficient public scrutiny, ultimately compromising national interest by eroding trust in democratic processes and open information exchange.", "model": "gemini-2.5-flash", "generated_at": "2025-06-21T22:43:46.668690", "source_hash": "a43a23cf106372de168141a5db2d8630261dbd466c8c37a4db9e3f2935d4593e", "raw_response_path": "data/llm_responses/LEX7205__per_file__right_leaning__lex7205-schedule.pdf__20250621T224346.json", "output_tokens": 446, "prompt_tokens": 3710, "total_tokens": 5365, "summary_length": 2535}, "government_skeptic": {"text": "This document, a table of contents for the FOI release, offers stark evidence of the Australian Electoral Commission's \"Defending Democracy Unit\" (DDU) and Electoral Integrity Assurance Team (EIAT) deeply intertwining with global tech giants. The sheer volume of listed meetings\u2014with X, Google/YouTube, Meta, Microsoft, LinkedIn, and TikTok\u2014demonstrates an extensive, ongoing, and arguably overreaching collaboration far beyond simple electoral administration.\n\nFrom a skeptic's viewpoint, the document highlights:\n\n*   **Bureaucratic Entanglement & Lack of Accountability:** Nearly every listed document is granted only \"Partial Access,\" with vague exemptions like `S 22` (irrelevant information), `S 47E(d)` (agency operations), and `S 47F(1)` (personal privacy). This pervasive redaction signals a deliberate lack of transparency, enabling the AEC to obscure the specifics of its dealings. Critically, nine documents, with their subject lines completely redacted, are outright \"Refused Access\" under `S 37` (Law Enforcement). This specific exemption, mentioned in the FOI overview, is a major red flag, suggesting the AEC is hiding information potentially related to enforcement actions or sensitive strategies that could undermine public trust.\n*   **Hidden Agendas & Overreach:** Document titles reveal a proactive engagement with content management that stretches the AEC's mandate. Examples include \"FOR INFO: YouTube Video Reported Yesterday\" and, most concerningly, \"Request for Information: Blocking Microsoft AI Image Generation of Specific AEC Employees\" and \"For Action: LinkedIn Meeting Placeholder and List of AEC Names to Block from AI Tools.\" This demonstrates a clear agenda focused on managing online narratives and even protecting AEC officials' images from AI generation, indicating a shift from facilitating elections to controlling public perception and potentially engaging in self-protection.\n*   **Reliance on Private Entities:** The numerous \"briefings\" from companies like \"Microsoft Democracy Forward\" and discussions around \"Tik Tok\u2019s Commitment to the AI Election\u2019s Accord\" suggest the AEC is not only collaborating with but potentially relying on, and being influenced by, tech giants for \"intelligence\" and strategies. This blurs the lines between government oversight and corporate influence, raising questions about who truly dictates the \"defending democracy\" agenda. The constant scheduling and rescheduling of meetings (e.g., \"Re: Action Items from October Meeting,\" \"Proposed Meeting,\" \"Rescheduling Request\") further illustrate the deep, ongoing, and perhaps too-cozy relationship between the regulator and the regulated.", "model": "gemini-2.5-flash", "generated_at": "2025-06-21T22:43:59.597385", "source_hash": "a43a23cf106372de168141a5db2d8630261dbd466c8c37a4db9e3f2935d4593e", "raw_response_path": "data/llm_responses/LEX7205__per_file__government_skeptic__lex7205-schedule.pdf__20250621T224359.json", "output_tokens": 522, "prompt_tokens": 3714, "total_tokens": 5644, "summary_length": 2661}, "government_apologist": {"text": "This comprehensive document unequivocally demonstrates the government's highly proactive and effective strategy in safeguarding Australia's democratic processes. The detailed listing of engagements with major online platforms\u2014including X, Google/YouTube, Meta, Microsoft, and TikTok\u2014underscores the Australian Electoral Commission's (AEC) remarkable competence and foresight. Through its dedicated Electoral Integrity Assurance Taskforce (EIAT) and Defending Democracy Unit, the government is shown to be diligently fostering crucial partnerships, evidenced by numerous meeting requests, follow-ups, and briefings aimed at mitigating threats like AI-generated misinformation and foreign interference.\n\nThe inclusion of specific actions, such as requests to block AEC employees from AI image generation tools and the AEC Commissioner's engagement with TikTok on AI election accords, highlights the government's sound policy of adapting to emerging challenges with innovative and preventive measures. Furthermore, the awareness of international influence efforts, as seen in references to UK and US election reports, confirms a sophisticated approach to integrating global best practices.\n\nWhile necessary redactions (under exemptions like S22, S47E(d), S47F(1), and S37) are applied to protect sensitive operational details and vital national security information, the overwhelming majority of documents are granted partial access. This balanced approach to transparency reflects a steadfast adherence to the public interest, ensuring the security and integrity of electoral operations without compromising essential intelligence. This document is a testament to the government's unwavering dedication to a secure, transparent, and resilient electoral landscape for all Australians.", "model": "gemini-2.5-flash", "generated_at": "2025-06-21T22:45:05.226890", "source_hash": "a43a23cf106372de168141a5db2d8630261dbd466c8c37a4db9e3f2935d4593e", "raw_response_path": "data/llm_responses/LEX7205__per_file__government_apologist__lex7205-schedule.pdf__20250621T224505.json", "output_tokens": 306, "prompt_tokens": 3714, "total_tokens": 5189, "summary_length": 1781}, "highly_critical": {"text": "This FOI document log exposes the Australian Electoral Commission's (AEC) Electoral Integrity Assurance Taskforce (EIAT) as a pathetically subservient entity, its purported \"assurance\" a mere fa\u00e7ade for a relationship of total dependence on, and capitulation to, tech monopolies. The pervasive \"Partial Access\" and egregious \"Refuse Access\" exemptions (S22, S47E(d), S47F(1), and chillingly, S37 for \"Redacted subject line\" documents 55-63) are not mere administrative choices but a deliberate, systemic strategy to gut public accountability, burying any hope of scrutinizing the AEC's abject failures.\n\nThe virtually non-existent engagement with **X (formerly Twitter)** (Document 1, \"Accepted: EIAT Meeting with X Representatives\" \u2013 a singular, isolated entry) is a damning indictment of either utter incompetence or a shocking abdication of responsibility. While X spirals into a disinformation cesspool, the AEC appears to have barely registered its existence, leaving a critical vector for election interference completely unaddressed. This isn't oversight; it's dereliction of duty, implicitly allowing foreign influence and harmful narratives to proliferate unchecked.\n\nInteractions with **Google/YouTube** are equally damning. The cancellation of a crucial meeting (Document 8, \"Canceled: AEC Meeting with Google and YouTube\") immediately signals a lack of urgency and control from the AEC, while the subsequent \"FOR INFO: YouTube Video Reported Yesterday\" (Document 32) highlights a reactive, overwhelmed posture. The AEC is not proactively anticipating threats but belatedly receiving notifications about already circulating misinformation, demonstrating its inability to pre-empt or effectively counter malicious content that may have already garnered tens of thousands of views. The constant \"Partial Access\" over all Google/YouTube communications ensures the public remains blind to the depth of their failures or the hollowness of their \"follow-up\" actions.\n\n**Microsoft's \"Democracy Forward\"** initiative (Documents 30, 36-40, 43-46) is revealed as a thinly veiled corporate sales pitch, with the AEC seemingly a captive audience. More alarmingly, the AEC's priorities are grotesquely misaligned, as evidenced by requests like \"Blocking Microsoft AI Image Generation of Specific AEC Employees\" (Document 26) and \"List of AEC Names to Block from AI Tools\" (Document 33). This isn't about defending democracy; it's a pathetic preoccupation with staff images while the existential threat of systemic AI-driven disinformation looms. The AEC's resources and attention are squandered on trivial, self-protective measures instead of demanding robust, open-source protections or leveraging AI for genuine electoral integrity. This reveals either profound ignorance of the true threats or a craven prioritization of internal vanity over public safety.\n\n**TikTok** engagement (Documents 47, 52, 54) showcases the AEC's reactive posture, seemingly accepting \"Tik Tok\u2019s Commitment to the AI Election\u2019s Accord\" rather than dictating terms or demanding stringent compliance. The proposed \"In App\u2019 Information Hub\" (Document 52) suggests the AEC is allowing platforms to self-regulate and control the informational narrative, an abdication of its own oversight responsibilities.\n\nThe overarching theme is one of pathetic, reactive scrambling, constantly outmanoeuvred by the very tech giants enabling election interference. The AEC's \"Electoral Integrity Assurance Taskforce\" is exposed as a toothless tiger, its public engagement a sham, and its operational integrity compromised by its inability or unwillingness to demand true transparency and accountability from the tech monopolies whose profit motives clearly trump the integrity of future Australian elections. The pervasive secrecy embedded in these FOI exemptions is not merely inconvenient; it is a deliberate obfuscation designed to shield the AEC's systemic incompetence and its alarming subservience from public scrutiny, leaving Australian democracy dangerously exposed.", "model": "gemini-2.5-flash", "generated_at": "2025-06-21T22:46:24.302053", "source_hash":

Electoral Commission (AEC) concerning its engagement with the online platform 'X' (formerly Twitter).\n\n1.  **August 13, 2024 Email:** A request from the AEC's Defending Democracy Unit (DDU) for a meeting in Singapore (September 24-26, 2024) between AEC's Deputy Electoral Commissioner and Assistant Commissioner, and an X representative. The meeting's purpose is to discuss lessons learned by X from global elections in 2024, in preparation for the upcoming Australian Federal Election (FE25).\n2.  **February 3, 2025 Email:** An accepted meeting invitation for a Microsoft Teams call on the same date, between the AEC's Electoral Integrity Assurance Taskforce (EIAT) and X representatives. The provisional agenda includes discussions on the potential timing of FE25, the AEC's role in the information environment, observations from global 2024 elections (from both AEC and X perspectives), updates on X's policy settings, and the confirmation of referral and escalation pathways for content.\n\n**Relevance to FOI Request:**\n\nThis document is highly relevant to the FOI request, directly illustrating the AEC's \"extensive interactions\" and \"engagement with major online platforms\" to safeguard electoral integrity for FE25. Specifically, it demonstrates:\n\n*   **Collaboration with EIAT and DDU:** Both the Electoral Integrity Assurance Taskforce (EIAT) and the Defending Democracy Unit (DDU) are actively coordinating meetings with X, aligning with their roles in the AEC's strategy.\n*   **Lessons from Global Elections:** A core theme for both scheduled interactions is the application of insights from 2024 global elections to the Australian context, directly supporting the FOI's mentioned goal of learning from international experiences.\n*   **Streamlining Referral and Escalation Pathways:** The explicit inclusion of \"Confirmation of referral and escalation pathways\" in the February 2025 meeting agenda directly addresses the FOI's focus on establishing efficient processes for problematic content.\n*   **Countering Misinformation/Disinformation:** Discussions on \"AEC's role in the current information environment,\" \"X update,\" and \"Changes in policy settings\" are integral to the broader objective of managing AI-generated content (AIGC) and countering misinformation ahead of FE25.\n*   **Preparing for FE25:** Both communications are explicitly framed around preparations for the upcoming federal election, ensuring a secure and credible information environment.", "model": "gemini-2.5-flash", "generated_at": "2025-06-23T23:01:46.974237", "source_hash": "1ef45c27ad7ed8aea12dad78eb7dcde9dd1e5f1e1b18948ede6ec8499ea19654", "raw_response_path": "data/llm_responses/LEX7205__per_file__balanced__Documents 1-2 - X - Compiled Documents.pdf__20250623T230146.json", "output_tokens": 547, "prompt_tokens": 1220, "total_tokens": 3013, "summary_length": 2589}, "left_leaning": {"text": "This document reveals the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) actively seeking insights on election integrity from the private social media platform, X, in Singapore. From a left-leaning perspective, this email underscores the alarming trend of the AEC outsourcing critical democratic functions and electoral integrity discussions to unelected, profit-driven global tech giants. The explicit intent to discuss \"what X may have learned from global elections\" directly signifies a reliance on a corporate entity for crucial insights into electoral processes and information management, including implicitly, content moderation strategies.\n\nThis reliance cedes significant control over public discourse and the integrity of elections to private interests, reinforcing concentrated corporate power and wealth at the expense of democratic accountability. The offshore nature of the proposed meeting further compounds concerns about transparency, making public scrutiny of these interactions difficult. This engagement raises serious implications for potential state-sanctioned censorship by proxy and the erosion of civil liberties like freedom of speech, as the AEC aligns itself with a platform whose content policies are ultimately driven by corporate motives rather than public good.", "model": "gemini-2.5-flash", "generated_at": "2025-06-21T22:30:48.734019", "source_hash": "636aa1c7662c5d1c9eae0a6ad6459728fbbc4e81f4426cd1951dfa416ed5ccfa", "raw_response_path": "data/llm_responses/LEX7205__per_file__left_leaning__Documents 1-2 - X - Compiled Documents.pdf__20250621T223048.json", "output_tokens": 205, "prompt_tokens": 633, "total_tokens": 1481, "summary_length": 1284}, "right_leaning": {"text": "This document highlights the Australian Electoral Commission\u2019s (AEC) proactive engagement with major tech platforms, specifically X (formerly Twitter), raising significant concerns about government overreach and the erosion of market freedom. The request for AEC Deputy Electoral Commissioner Jeff Pope and Assistant Commissioner Matt Haigh to meet with X in Singapore to discuss \"what X may have learned from global elections\" in preparation for Australia's next federal election underscores the AEC's deep involvement in shaping online content.\n\nThis initiative, led by the \"Defending Democracy Unit\" and \"Electoral Integrity and Media Branch,\" signals a concerning \"mission creep\" beyond traditional electoral oversight into active content management. It suggests the AEC intends to leverage a private company's global moderation practices, potentially pressuring X to adopt \"policy settings\" and \"escalation pathways\" that could restrict free expression and influence the marketplace of ideas. Such governmental influence on a private platform's content policies impinges on market freedom and risks creating a semi-regulated digital environment where speech is curated to align with official narratives, rather than allowing for open discourse.\n\nWhile countering foreign interference is vital to national interest, the document, when viewed in the context of the broader FOI request, points to a desire for expanded control over online information, including \"misinformation\" and \"AI-generated content.\" This blurs the line between national security and censorship, ultimately threatening individual liberty and free speech.

The pathetic request for a meeting, initiated in mid-August for late September, perfectly encapsulates the AEC's \"scramble\" to engage with X (a platform the FOI overview rightly identifies as a \"disinformation cesspool\") only after global elections have already exposed its catastrophic failures.\n\nThe very location of this proposed meeting \u2013 at an international conference in Singapore \u2013 suggests either a thinly veiled junket for senior AEC officials (Pope and Haigh) or a damning indictment of the AEC's inability to command engagement on home soil or on its own terms. The AEC's grovelling deference is laid bare by Jeff Pope's willingness to \"prioritise a meeting with you on one of these days based on your availability,\" effectively ceding control and emphasizing X's perceived importance over the integrity of Australia's democratic processes.\n\nThe meeting's purported objective \u2013 \"to discuss what X may have learned from global elections this year\" \u2013 is shockingly vague and passive. It reveals a critical lack of proactive strategy, portraying the AEC as a supplicant hoping to glean crumbs of information from a corporation whose profit motives demonstrably trump election integrity. There is no mention of demanding accountability for X's role in previous or ongoing disinformation, no assertive call for data sharing, nor any concrete terms for future engagement. Instead, the AEC implicitly legitimizes X's status as a key, albeit deeply flawed, arbiter of information, rather than asserting its own regulatory authority or demanding robust preventative measures.\n\nThis document serves as a stark illustration of the AEC's \"utter capitulation or shocking incompetence\" regarding X, offering a token gesture of engagement with a known \"disinformation cesspool\" while future elections remain dangerously exposed. The email's deferential tone and lack of specific demands question the unit's actual commitment to \"defending democracy,\" suggesting it's more concerned with appearing to act rather than achieving meaningful outcomes against powerful, unaccountable tech monopolies.", "model": "gemini-2.5-flash", "generated_at": "2025-06-21T22:46:35.732456", "source_hash": "636aa1c7662c5d1c9eae0a6ad6459728fbbc4e81f4426cd1951dfa416ed5ccfa", "raw_response_path": "data/llm_responses/LEX7205__per_file__highly_critical__Documents 1-2 - X - Compiled Documents.pdf__20250621T224635.json", "output_tokens": 441, "prompt_tokens": 702, "total_tokens": 2135, "summary_length": 2312}}, "extracted_text": "\n\n--- Page 1 ---\n\n2\n\nFrom: Google Calendar <calendar-notification@google.com> on behalf (iii\n\nSent: Monday, 3 February 2025 1:10 PM\n\nTo: EIAT\n\nSubject: Accepted: EIAT meeting with X representatives [SEC=OFFICIAL] @ Mon\nFeb 3, 2025 11:00 - 12:00 (GMT+9) (EIAT)\n\nAttachments: invite.ics\n\nSE has accepted this invitation.\n\nGood morning ag, Attachments\n\n001.\nThank you for confirming your availability for this meeting in February as the mage png\n\ntaskforce works towards the next federal election.

Meeting agendas explicitly mention preparing for **FE25** and ensuring timely and accurate information about the electoral process.\n*   **Countering Misinformation and Disinformation:**\n    *   The **AEC** seeks updates on **Meta's** observations from global elections, including changes in the online environment related to **misinformation** and **disinformation**.\n    *   **Meta** provides details on its **AAP Check the Facts Media Literacy campaign**, run for the 2023 Voice Referendum and extended to focus on **AI-generated content** awareness.\n    *   **Meta** shares information on its **network disruption efforts** against Coordinated Inauthentic Behaviour, such as the Russian 'Doppelganger' group, directly addressing foreign interference.\n    *   The **AEC** specifically queries **Meta's** response to Russian-linked influence efforts in the UK election to learn from these real-life scenarios for **FE25**.\n*   **Managing AI-Generated Content (AIGC):**\n    *   **AIGC** is a central theme in meeting agendas (e.g., \"changes in the online environment, including the use of generative AI\").\n    *   **Meta** outlines its policy changes, including adding **\"AI info\" labels** to a wider range of video, audio, and image content, and new **AI Ad Disclosure requirements** for political advertising.\n    *   **Meta** highlights its participation in the **Tech Accord to Combat Deceptive Use of AI in 2024 Elections**.\n    *   The **AEC** is updating its \"Online Platform Scenarios\" to include **AI-specific scenarios** for discussion with platforms.\n*   **Applying Lessons from Global Elections:** Meeting agendas repeatedly reference discussing **EIAT's** and **Meta's** observations and lessons learned from global elections in 2024 (e.g., US, India, Indonesia, EU) and their implications for Australia.\n*   **Streamlining Referral and Escalation Pathways:** Confirmation of **referral and escalation pathways** for flagging potential issues with **Meta** is a standing agenda item for meetings between the **AEC** and **Meta**.\n*   **Direct Communication Channels:** The correspondence explicitly establishes and uses direct communication lines between the **AEC's DDU** and **Meta's** policy teams for ongoing collaboration and issue resolution.\n*   **Policy Updates:** Discussions include **Meta's** changes in policy settings and how these align with the AEC's needs for **FE25**.", "model": "gemini-2.5-flash", "generated_at": "2025-06-23T23:02:04.354344", "source_hash": "70a07fe7629fe302df86e003d3d3a0d95d9fff728e1ea21bc6cdbe9b132b8426", "raw_response_path": "data/llm_responses/LEX7205__per_file__balanced__Documents 17-21 - Meta - Compiled Documents.pdf__20250623T230204.json", "output_tokens": 722, "prompt_tokens": 9238, "total_tokens": 11679, "summary_length": 3325}, "left_leaning": {"text": "This document reveals a concerning level of reliance by the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC)'s Electoral Integrity Assurance Taskforce (EIAT) and Defending Democracy Unit (DDU) on Meta (Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp) for managing election integrity. The extensive email exchanges detail regular meetings where the AEC seeks updates from Meta on its global election observations, \"policy settings,\" and crucial \"referral and escalation pathways\" for content moderation. This explicitly confirms the outsourcing of core democratic functions\u2014namely, the management of public discourse around elections\u2014to a private, for-profit tech giant.\n\nFrom a left-leaning perspective, this dependency is alarming. It signifies a fundamental shift where the AEC cedes significant control over the information environment during elections to an unelected corporation whose primary allegiance is to its shareholders, not the Australian public. Meta's internal \"policy settings\" and \"community standards\" become the de facto rules governing electoral speech, raising serious concerns about state-sanctioned censorship by proxy and the erosion of civil liberties like freedom of speech. The document highlights Meta's role in \"media literacy campaigns\" and countering \"coordinated inauthentic behaviour,\" tasks that, while framed positively, empower a private entity to shape public narratives and police online activity.\n\nFurthermore, the document exposes a critical lack of transparency and accountability. The AEC's request for more information regarding Meta's approval of \"political ads in India that incited violence\" during a global election, and Meta's evasive response, underscores the limited oversight and the opacity surrounding these powerful platforms' actions. This, compounded by the extensive redactions throughout the document that obscure key details and personnel, fundamentally undermines public transparency and accountability in a crucial aspect of democratic governance. This reliance on powerful, opaque corporations reinforces concentrated corporate power and wealth at the expense of publicly governed democratic processes, presenting a clear threat to social equity and democratic accountability.", "model": "gemini-2.5-flash", "generated_at": "2025-06-21T22:31:02.540822", "source_hash": "3431158454dbc612cb5169f1ffebf0396a5c0671f642fc0b6ae1a4c113fbed7c", "raw_response_path": "data/llm_responses/LEX7205__per_file__left_leaning__Documents 17-21 - Meta - Compiled Documents.pdf__20250621T223102.json", "output_tokens": 382, "prompt_tokens": 10383, "total_tokens": 12299, "summary_length": 2209}, "right_leaning": {"text": "This document details extensive ongoing collaborations between the Australian Electoral Commission\u2019s (AEC) Defending Democracy Unit (DDU) and Electoral Integrity Assurance Taskforce (EIAT) and Meta (Facebook, Instagram) representatives, ostensibly in preparation for the upcoming federal election. Far from mere administrative discussions, the scheduled meetings and follow-up correspondence explicitly focus on how the AEC can influence and leverage Meta's content management policies and \"escalation pathways.\"\n\nKey agenda items and AEC requests underscore a concerning degree of government overreach into digital public discourse:\n\n*   **Policy Influence and Control:** The AEC directly seeks information on \"any changes in policy settings\" from Meta and \"confirmation of referral and escalation pathways.\" This indicates a desire for the AEC to have direct avenues to flag and potentially remove content it deems problematic, thereby exerting influence over the free flow of information on private platforms.\n*   **Content Management of \"Misinformation\" and AI:** Discussions explicitly include Meta\u2019s approach to \"labelling AI-Generated content\" and handling \"mis and disinformation\" related to elections. Meta confirms it will activate its \"cross-functional election integrity team to work closely with the AEC and monitor for any violations of our policies, including relating to mis and disinformation, hate speech and incitement to violence.\" This blurs the lines between legitimate electoral oversight and the state-sanctioned policing of online speech.\n*   **\"Media Literacy Campaigns\" as Tools of Persuasion:** The AEC expresses interest in Meta\u2019s \"media literacy campaigns,\" which include efforts to \"raise awareness of AI-generated content online.\" While presented benignly, these campaigns, when conducted in collaboration with a government body, can be viewed as attempts to shape public perception and dictate what constitutes \"reliable\" information, undermining open debate and market freedom of ideas.\n*   **Opaque Coordination:** The document highlights regular, direct engagements between the AEC and a major tech platform on matters of content moderation and \"information environment\" management. The emphasis on \"escalation pathways\" suggests a system of content flagging and potential censorship operating outside public scrutiny, raising serious transparency and accountability concerns.\n\nIn essence, these communications reveal a robust and proactive effort by the AEC to extend its influence beyond traditional electoral administration into the realm of digital content moderation. This represents a significant \"mission creep\" that infringes upon market freedom by influencing the information environment, embodies government overreach into the digital public square, and poses a direct threat to individual liberty and free speech by establishing mechanisms for state-influenced censorship of online discourse.", "model": "gemini-2.5-flash", "generated_at": "2025-06-21T22:32:21.965491", "source_hash": "3431158454dbc612cb5169f1ffebf0396a5c0671f642fc0b6ae1a4c113fbed7c", "raw_response_path": "data/llm_responses/LEX7205__per_file__right_leaning__Documents 17-21 - Meta - Compiled Documents.pdf__20250621T223221.json", "output_tokens": 515, "prompt_tokens": 10400, "total_tokens": 12509, "summary_length": 2939}, "government_skeptic": {"text": "This document reveals the Australian Electoral Commission's (AEC) \"Defending Democracy Unit\" (DDU) and the multi-agency Electoral Integrity Assurance Taskforce (EIAT) are engaged in systematic, proactive \"collaboration\" with Meta (Facebook/Instagram) to manage online narratives ahead of federal elections.\n\nKey skeptical observations:\n\n*   **Proactive Narrative Management:** The AEC initiates meetings \"in preparation for the next federal election\" to discuss \"EIAT\u2019s role in the current information environment \u2013 education campaigns, activity on social media.\" This suggests an active, pre-emptive effort to shape public discourse, moving beyond mere electoral facilitation to defining and propagating \"accurate information.\"\n*   **Direct Influence & \"Escalation Pathways\":** The AEC explicitly seeks \"confirmation of referral and escalation pathways\" and discusses \"Meta's policy settings.\" This demonstrates the AEC's intent to actively flag content for removal or action by a private entity, blurring the lines between governmental administration and content censorship.

This document, a series of detailed communications with Meta, highlights the government's robust and essential collaborations with major online platforms.\n\nThe relentless scheduling and diligent follow-up of high-level meetings, extending from late 2024 into early 2025, showcase the government's foresight and commitment to meticulous preparation for the next federal election. Key agenda items initiated by the EIAT and DDU reveal a strategic focus on enhancing public education campaigns regarding the information environment and leveraging critical observations from global elections to strengthen Australia's unique electoral defenses.\n\nNotably, these exchanges underscore the government's astute focus on emerging threats, particularly AI-generated content and misinformation. The AEC has actively sought and secured crucial updates from Meta on its policy settings, confirmation of vital referral and escalation pathways, and detailed insights into Meta's responses to the proliferation of generative AI. The government's initiative in updating its \"Online Platform Scenarios\" to include AI-specific challenges further exemplifies its dynamic and adaptive strategy for the public good.\n\nFurthermore, the document reveals the AEC's diligent pursuit of action items, including obtaining comprehensive information on Meta's highly successful media literacy campaigns. For instance, the \"Check the Facts\" initiative for the 2023 Voice Referendum commendably reached over 10 million users, reflecting effective government-platform partnerships. The government's unwavering commitment to understanding and combating foreign interference (such as Russian-linked operations) and its proactive stance on AI in political advertising illustrate a comprehensive and responsible approach to electoral integrity.\n\nThese interactions clearly demonstrate a government deeply dedicated to transparent, secure, and accessible elections, consistently adapting to emerging challenges through forward-thinking strategies and vigorous, collaborative partnerships, all in the paramount interest of public good.", "model": "gemini-2.5-flash", "generated_at": "2025-06-21T22:45:27.496085", "source_hash": "3431158454dbc612cb5169f1ffebf0396a5c0671f642fc0b6ae1a4c113fbed7c", "raw_response_path": "data/llm_responses/LEX7205__per_file__government_apologist__Documents 17-21 - Meta - Compiled Documents.pdf__20250621T224527.json", "output_tokens": 403, "prompt_tokens": 10404, "total_tokens": 12661, "summary_length": 2342}, "highly_critical": {"text": "This document lays bare the Australian Electoral Commission\u2019s (AEC) Electoral Integrity Assurance Taskforce (EIAT) as demonstrably subservient and profoundly ineffective in its purported defence of democracy. Far from a robust oversight body, the EIAT is shown to be a pathetic, reactive entity, perpetually outmanoeuvred and dictated to by Meta\u2019s corporate agenda.\n\nThe scheduling of vital meetings, allegedly to discuss election integrity, is not only initiated reactively \u2013 a mere year before the latest possible election date \u2013 but is also entirely on Meta\u2019s terms. The AEC meekly apologises for being a \"nuisance\" and accommodates Meta\u2019s \"global calls\" and \"travel commitments,\" exposing a shocking power imbalance where Meta\u2019s convenience clearly trumps Australia\u2019s electoral security. The AEC is reduced to issuing \"placeholder invites\" and waiting for corporate approval, betraying a fundamental lack of assertiveness and a shocking absence of pre-defined, non-negotiable engagement protocols.\n\nThe document's most damning revelations emerge from the AEC's desperate attempts to glean actionable intelligence from Meta. The AEC's direct inquiry into Meta's alleged approval of \"political ads in India that incited violence\" is met with an astonishing corporate stonewall. Meta brazenly claims it is \"unable to share any further comment or insight\" because the perpetrators \"immediately deleted the ads.\" This is a cynical, self-serving evasion, a deliberate refusal to provide crucial intelligence on a catastrophic failure that directly impacts the integrity of future elections, leaving Australia dangerously exposed to identical, AI-incited threats. Meta's subsequent vague assurances about \"activating\" a \"cross-functional election integrity team\" are rendered meaningless by this blatant obfuscation.\n\nFurthermore, the document reveals the AEC chasing Meta for over six months for information on \"Russian-linked influence efforts\" in the UK election, only to be fobbed off with generic references to public \"Transparency Reports\" rather than specific, actionable intelligence on detection methods or takedown timelines. This highlights Meta's disregard for genuine collaboration and its preference for managing public perception over providing critical security insights. Meta's boasts about \"media literacy campaigns\" reaching \"10 million users\" are superficial \"reach\" metrics, designed to mask any real impact or accountability, reinforcing the criticism that corporate agendas clearly trump integrity.\n\nThe pervasive \"s22s47Fs47Fs47E\" redactions throughout the document further underscore the deliberate cloaking of public accountability, ensuring that the true extent of the AEC's pathetic reliance and Meta's systemic failures remain hidden from public scrutiny.

Further information on the campaign is available on p37 of our latest Transparency Report \nunder the Australian Code of Practice on Disinformation and Misinformation. We also supported AAP to run a new \ncampaign in H2 this year, focused on raising awareness of AI-generated content online. This campaign only recently \nconcluded and we hope to be able to share the results with you in early 2025.  \n\nNetwork disruption efforts to counter the Russian \u2018Doppelganger\u2019 group \n\nPlease see a detailed case study outlining this work as well as our wider recent efforts to counter Coordinated \nInauthentic Behaviour on p11 of our latest Transparency Report under the Australian Code of Practice on \nDisinformation and Misinformation, which we submitted through our industry association DIGI in May this year. \n\nMeta\u2019s approach to labelling AI-Generated content and claims regarding the use of AI in political advertising on \nMeta\u2019s platforms during the Indian election \n\nIn April 2024, we announced changes to the way that Meta is handling manipulated media, based on feedback from \nthe Oversight Board and our policy review process with public opinion surveys and expert consultations. This \nincluded adding \u201cAI info\u201d labels to a wider range of video, audio and image content when we detect industry \nstandard AI image indicators or when people disclose that they\u2019re uploading AI-generated content. Further details \non this announcement may be viewed here. \n\nWith respect to advertising, any user who wants to run ads on our services about elections or politics must go \nthrough the authorisation process required on our platforms and is responsible for complying with applicable laws. \nWhenever content on our services - including ads - violates our community standards or community guidelines, we \nremove it, regardless of whether or not it is AI-generated. In the case of the reports specifically raised during this \nyear\u2019s election in India, the authors immediately deleted the ads in question, so we are unable to share any further \ncomment or insight regarding the claims that were made. Leading up to the Australian election, however, we will \nactivate our cross-functional election integrity team to work closely with the AEC and monitor for any violations of \nour policies, including relating to mis and disinformation, hate speech and incitement to violence, in relation to the \nelection process and debate.  \n\n1\n\ns22s47Fs47Fs47Fs47Fs47F\n\n\n--- Page 9 ---\n\nFinally, we thought it might also be useful to share with you a recap by our President of Global Affairs, Nick Clegg, \noutlining our efforts and observations across the 2024 global elections, including in the US, India, Indonesia and the \nEU and in relation to the impact of AI, as well as freedom of expression and combating foreign interference. \n\nWe hope that the above information is useful, but please let us know if you have any follow-up questions. We did \nsee the recent press reports that Commissioner Rogers\u2019 term at the AEC has recently concluded. We wish him all the \nvery best and are sure that his many achievements while in the role were well celebrated ahead of his departure. \nWe look forward to the opportunity to meet with the new Commissioner once they are settled into the role in the \nnew year.  \n\nIn the meantime, we wish you all the very best for a safe and happy holiday season and looking forward to working \nwith the AEC in 2025 and collaborating closely ahead of the upcoming election. \n\nKind regards \n\nHead of Policy, Australia & Head of Policy Programs, Australia, New Zealand & Pacific Islands  \n\nFrom: \nDate: Thursday, 5 December 2024 at 11:52\u202fam \nTo: \nCc: \nSubject: RE: REQUEST : Following up on 2024 action items [SEC=OFFICIAL] \n\n , Defending Democracy Unit , \n\nHi \n\n, \n\nJust checking in with a gentle reminder about the below information we requested a couple of weeks back. \n\nYou must have a lot on your plate given the bills relating to social media that went before parliament over the past \ncouple of weeks!

As we have \nclarity on the timing of the next federal election, we look forward to establishing more regular \nengagements and scenario planning to ensure both of our teams are ready to liaise in relation to emerging \nissues. \n\nWe appreciate that there has been a greater adoption of Generative AI tools in today's society and we look \nforward to working with the AEC and other stakeholders on the potential challenges that they may \npresent. In case it is of interest, I\u2019ve attached our submission to the Department of Industry\u2019s Safe and \nResponsible AI consultation last year. At Meta, we have been working on AI for over a decade and \u201cclassic \nAI\u201d is a key part of our content governance and security systems. Additionally, content that has been \ncreated or altered using AI is still subject to our content policies and fact checking initiative.  \n\nThat said, we recognise that new policies and approaches are needed as the use of GenAI becomes more \nwidespread. Since we filed our submission late last year, we have made a number of announcements that \nmay be of interest to you: \n\n4\n\ns47Fs47Fs47Fs47Fs47Fs47Fs47Fs47Fs47Fs47Fs47F\n\n\n--- Page 12 ---\n\n\uf0b7  Adjustments to manipulated media policy: in response to feedback from the Oversight Board, we announced changes \nto how we handle manipulated media. The Board recommended that we broaden the scope of our manipulated media \npolicy, but stop removing manipulated media that do not otherwise violate our Community Standards. \nLabeling AI-generated Images: we have been working with industry to develop both visible markers and invisible labels \nand metadata on images generated by AI tools. \n\n\uf0b7 \n\n\uf0b7  AI Ad Disclosure policy: we\u2019ve introduced new disclosure requirements for advertisers using AI or digital methods in \n\nsocial, electoral, or political ads. \n\nAs you may have seen, we are also one of the companies that signed up to the Tech Accord to Combat \nDeceptive Use of AI in 2024 Elections is a set of commitments to deploy technology countering harmful AI-\ngenerated content meant to deceive voters. \n\nAnd in relation to media literacy campaigns and how we measure success, as we mentioned, ahead of the \nVoice  Referendum,  we partnered  with  Australian  Associated  Press  (AAP)  to  launch  a  new media  literacy \ncampaign that shared tips and advice with people so that they could make informed decisions about what \nthey read, trust and share. The campaign videos (examples here and here) were scripted and shot by AAP \nFactCheck journalists and aimed to generate awareness of tactics used to spread mis- and disinformation \nand by driving audiences to check the facts via the AAP Fact Check website. The campaign ran for six weeks \nwith a combined reach on Facebook and Instagram in Australia of over 10 million users, creating over 40 \nmillion impressions.  \n\nThe latest EU campaign that you mentioned is currently being finalised in partnership with the European \nFact-Checking Standards Network and specifically aims to raise public awareness of how to spot AI-\ngenerated and digitally altered content. The campaign is scheduled to launch ahead of the 2024 EU \nParliament Elections next month and will comprise a number of infographics and an explainer video. We \ncan share details of the campaign\u2019s reach and engagement with you when this information becomes \navailable.  \n\nFinally, please let us know if it would be helpful for us to arrange a virtual briefing with our colleague \ndirector on our security policy team, for a more detailed briefing about security trends and issues we\u2019re seeing globally. \n\n, a \n\nKind regards,  \n\n--  \nRegional Director of Policy | Australia, Japan, Korea, New Zealand & Pacific Islands \nM: \n\n | E: \n\nDISCLAIMER: \n\nIf you have received this transmission in error please notify us immediately by return email and delete all \ncopies.

I\u2019m writing regarding recent ABC reporting relating to five Facebook pages said to \nhave been linked to Russian foreign interference in the UK election. I understand these pages have since been taken \ndown by Meta for inauthentic behaviour.  \n\nWhile the material posted was not reported to have received a significant amount of authentic engagement, \nincidents like this present an opportunity for us to learn from real-life events around the world. In order for the AEC \nto consider how we can best prepare ourselves ahead of our next federal election, we are interested in \nunderstanding more about the following: \n\n- We understand that advanced persistent threat (APT) actors will adapt their tactics and change profiles. How is \nMeta dealing with this challenge? Is it anticipated that limitations in detection methods may mean similar material \ngoes undetected in future? \n- When Meta was made aware of the existence of the pages? \n- What steps were involved between being made aware of the pages and their takedown, and how long this took? \n- Whether there were other pages linked to the same network that have also been uncovered and actioned since? \n- Whether the ads review process detected any paid ads from these pages? \n- Whether elections operations centres include team members who specialise in detecting coordinated inauthentic \nbehaviour and counter covert influence operations ahead of electoral events? \n- If there is any further information linking these pages to Russia (beyond the pro-Russian messaging and that \nNigeria is a known base of operations for Russian-linked influence efforts)? \n\nHaving a more fulsome understanding of Meta\u2019s approach to this type of scenario will be very helpful for us to know \nhow best to respond in the event something similar occurs here during our next election. \n\nWe\u2019d be happy to discuss, if needed, and look forward to hearing from you. \n\nRegards \n\nMatt \n\nMatthew Haigh | Assistant Commissioner, Electoral Integrity and Media Branch (CISO & CRO) \nAustralian Electoral Commission  \n X: \n\n M: \n\nE: \n\n for PROTECTED material \n\nDISCLAIMER: \n\nIf you have received this transmission in error please notify us immediately by return email and delete all \ncopies.

This involves extensive briefings and engagements between AEC's \"Defending Democracy Unit,\" \"Electoral Integrity Assurance Taskforce\" (EIAT), Acting Commissioner, and Microsoft's various departments (Corporate External and Legal Affairs, Threat Analysis Centre, Threat Intelligence Centre, LinkedIn).\n\nCrucially, the document highlights how core democratic functions are being outsourced:\n*   **Content Moderation and Information Control:** Discussions revolve around \"content credentialing and pilot next steps,\" implying Microsoft's direct involvement in defining and labeling \"authentic\" media, potentially enabling state-sanctioned censorship by proxy. Furthermore, the AEC explicitly seeks to establish \"referral pathways\" with Microsoft/LinkedIn for \"online content of concern,\" effectively privatizing a vital aspect of public discourse oversight.\n*   **Suppression of Digital Expression:** A particularly alarming revelation is the AEC's request for Microsoft to \"block AI image generation of specific AEC employees\" and \"prominent figures plus federal candidates\" using its AI tools. This represents a direct attempt by a government agency to control the digital representation of public figures through a private corporation, a profound erosion of freedom of speech and the public's right to unadulterated information. The redacted \"spreadsheet of names\" underscores the deliberate obfuscation of these efforts.\n*   **Outsourcing Core Infrastructure and Intelligence:** Microsoft provides \"AccountGuard\" for cybersecurity, \"Azure for Election service\" for voter databases (offering \"proactive security reviews, resilience assessments, and load analysis,\" and \"highest tier of reactive support\"), and \"dedicated escalation points\" for \"election-sensitive issues.\" This signals a concerning hand-over of vital democratic infrastructure and intelligence to a private entity, reinforcing concentrated corporate power.\n*   **Lack of Transparency:** The extensive redactions throughout the document (s22, s47F/E/G) severely undermine public transparency and accountability. They obscure the full scope and nature of these partnerships, leaving citizens in the dark about the influence exerted by a private corporation over the integrity of their democratic processes.\n*   **Broader Implications:** The AEC's inquiry into a US subpoena served on Microsoft concerning \"foreign censorship of American speech\" further indicates Microsoft's global involvement in content control, reinforcing concerns about its potential role in limiting speech and shaping narratives within Australia.\n\nIn summary, this document exemplifies a concerning shift where a public democratic institution increasingly relies on a global tech giant for functions that are fundamental to free and fair elections, from cybersecurity to content moderation and even controlling digital likenesses, all while operating with a significant lack of transparency.", "model": "gemini-2.5-flash", "generated_at": "2025-06-21T22:31:18.844546", "source_hash": "4fbda34a989c23e6b206ba18bf41f6a0255d2f420c8bf0c232f33a4e2af4aa56", "raw_response_path": "data/llm_responses/LEX7205__per_file__left_leaning__Documents 22-46 - Microsoft - Compiled Documents.pdf__20250621T223118.json", "output_tokens": 597, "prompt_tokens": 42768, "total_tokens": 44812, "summary_length": 3366}, "right_leaning": {"text": "This document uncovers an alarming depth of integration between the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) and major tech platforms like Microsoft and LinkedIn, revealing a concerning expansion of government influence into digital public discourse. Far beyond its traditional role of administering elections, the AEC's \"Defending Democracy Unit\" and \"Electoral Integrity Assurance Taskforce (EIAT)\" are engaged in extensive collaboration with Microsoft's \"Democracy Forward\" team on matters of online content.\n\nThe scope of this collaboration constitutes a clear case of **government overreach** and **mission creep**. Discussions and planned training sessions go beyond cybersecurity and voter registration, extending into \"AI and synthetic media, dis and misinformation, cyber security,\" \"content credentialing,\" and \"responding to incidents.\" This blurs the line between protecting electoral systems and actively managing public information, infringing upon the principles of **market freedom** in the exchange of ideas.\n\nA particularly egregious example is the AEC's explicit request to Microsoft to **\"block\" the generation of AI images** of \"prominent figures plus federal candidates.\" This direct plea for pre-emptive censorship represents a chilling precedent, demonstrating a desire by the AEC to control what AI models can depict, thereby undermining **individual liberty** and **free speech** in the digital realm. The focus on \"misinformation\" and \"influence operations\" by an electoral body, acting in concert with private tech companies, risks stifling legitimate dissent and alternative viewpoints under the guise of \"electoral integrity.\"\n\nFurthermore, the document details \"dedicated escalation points\" with tech giants for \"election-sensitive issues\" and \"online content of concern to the AEC.\" This opaque mechanism allows unelected bureaucrats to fast-track content moderation or removal, creating a system of **unaccountable information control**. The reference to a subpoena from the US House Judiciary Chairman concerning \"foreign censorship of American speech\" serves as a stark international parallel, underscoring global concerns about government pressure on tech platforms to manage content.\n\nIn summary, these documents expose a pervasive and concerning effort by the AEC to exert unprecedented control over digital narratives and AI-generated content. This deep, private collaboration with tech companies, funded by taxpayers, fundamentally threatens market freedom, individual liberty, and free speech, transforming an electoral body into an arbiter of online truth.", "model": "gemini-2.5-flash", "generated_at": "2025-06-21T22:32:37.934260", "source_hash": "4fbda34a989c23e6b206ba18bf41f6a0255d2f420c8bf0c232f33a4e2af4aa56", "raw_response_path": "data/llm_responses/LEX7205__per_file__right_leaning__Documents 22-46 - Microsoft - Compiled Documents.pdf__20250621T223237.json", "output_tokens": 463, "prompt_tokens": 42785, "total_tokens": 45093, "summary_length": 2595}, "government_skeptic": {"text": "From a government skeptic's viewpoint, this document provides strong evidence for the Australian Electoral Commission's \"Defending Democracy Unit\" overstepping its mandate and engaging in an extensive, opaque collaboration with global tech giants, particularly Microsoft and LinkedIn, to manage online narratives.\n\n**Key concerns highlighted:**\n\n1.  **Direct Censorship/Image Control Agenda:** The most alarming revelation is the AEC's explicit request for Microsoft to \"block AI image generation of specific AEC employees,\" including the former and acting Electoral Commissioners. This demonstrates a clear move by a government agency to leverage private tech companies for personal or institutional image protection and potentially narrative control, blurring the lines between electoral administration and proactive suppression of information, even if AI-generated.\n2.  **Corporate Influence on \"Truth\":** Microsoft's \"Democracy Forward\" team is deeply embedded, offering \"training for AEC team\" on \"AI and synthetic media, dis and misinformation.\" This indicates a reliance on a private entity to define and combat subjective concepts like \"misinformation,\" risking the adoption of corporate biases and tools into what should be a neutral electoral process. The discussions around \"content credentialing\" and \"detection models\" further suggest a mechanism for identifying and potentially influencing what content is deemed legitimate or \"harmful.\"\n3.  **Opaque \"Content of Concern\" Pathways:** The establishment of \"single escalation mechanisms\" and \"appropriate referral pathways\" with LinkedIn and Microsoft for \"online content of concern to the AEC\" outlines a direct, potentially unscrutinised channel for content flagging and swift removal. This reliance on private platforms for \"election integrity\" bypasses traditional legal and oversight processes, creating a parallel system of content moderation.\n4.  **Deep Integration into Critical Infrastructure:** Microsoft's \"AccountGuard\" and \"Azure for Election service\" are presented as \"no-cost cybersecurity,\" but their integration into \"critical infrastructure that underpins our elections\" places a foreign private entity at the heart of Australian democratic processes, raising questions about data sovereignty, security, and potential undue influence.\n5.  **Bureaucratic Expansion of \"Democracy Defence\":** The extensive schedule of meetings with various government agencies (ASD, ACSC, ONI, DITRDCA) and Microsoft, focusing on \"threat intelligence\" and \"insights,\" paints a picture of a sprawling bureaucratic apparatus increasingly focused on managing the online information environment. The AEC's awareness of Microsoft's US subpoena regarding \"foreign censorship\" underscores the controversial nature of these tech collaborations and hints at broader content control agendas impacting free speech.\n\nIn essence, this document reveals an AEC that is not merely facilitating elections but actively engaging with and relying on tech giants to control online information, manage perceptions, and protect its officials' digital likenesses, all largely outside public scrutiny.", "model": "gemini-2.5-flash", "generated_at": "2025-06-21T22:44:18.244888", "source_hash": "4fbda34a989c23e6b206ba18bf41f6a0255d2f420c8bf0c232f33a4e2af4aa56", "raw_response_path": "data/llm_responses/LEX7205__per_file__government_skeptic__Documents 22-46 - Microsoft - Compiled Documents.pdf__20250621T224418.json", "output_tokens": 567, "prompt_tokens": 42789, "total_tokens": 45146, "summary_length": 3137}, "government_apologist": {"text": "The Australian Electoral Commission (AEC), through its expert Defending Democracy Unit (DDU) and the multi-agency Electoral Integrity Assurance Taskforce (EIAT), consistently demonstrates unparalleled foresight and proactive leadership in safeguarding our democratic processes.

Far from a robust defense of democracy, the AEC\u2019s interactions are a reactive scramble, constantly outmanoeuvred by Microsoft\u2019s self-serving corporate agenda, with public accountability deliberately gutted by implicit \"partial access\" to critical information.\n\nThe core of this document reveals Microsoft\u2019s \"Democracy Forward\" initiative not as a civic contribution, but as a brazen, well-orchestrated sales pitch for proprietary tools and services. Microsoft \"offers\" trainings on AI, synthetic media, and cybersecurity, effectively positioning itself as the sole authority and embedding its narrative into AEC operations. The AEC, instead of asserting its independent expertise or demanding genuine, open-source solutions, eagerly facilitates these corporate-controlled \"briefings,\" even offering office space for Microsoft executives, exposing its pitiable lack of leverage.\n\nA catastrophic misjudgment of priorities is evident in the AEC\u2019s desperate plea to Microsoft to \"block AI image generation of specific AEC employees and federal candidates.\" While the informational landscape is besieged by AI-incited violence and pervasive deepfakes, the AEC\u2019s reactive, bureaucratic concern is shockingly focused on individual staff images \u2013 a \"spreadsheet of names.\" This utterly prioritises superficial reputation management over systemic AI threats, demonstrating an alarming disconnect from the profound dangers posed to electoral integrity.\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s responses further underscore this power imbalance.

The blatant refusal to \"leave behind\" presentation slides from key briefings reinforces Microsoft's absolute control over information, effectively cloaking public accountability and preventing independent analysis by the AEC.\n\nThe AEC's reactive scramble is further highlighted by its belated and indirect inquiry about a *US subpoena* issued to Microsoft, begging for information on *foreign censorship*. This demonstrates a shocking lack of independent intelligence gathering and a complete reliance on Microsoft to disclose information crucial to understanding global election interference trends. Microsoft's evasive response (\"working on our response, consistent with our commitment to compliance with local laws\") reveals its primary motive: self-protection and profit, consistently trumping any genuine commitment to transparent electoral integrity.

Please see below an update from Microsoft on \nmeasures implemented to meet the commitments agreed to as a signatory of the Tech Accord to \nCombat Deceptive Use of AI in 2024 Elections.  \n\nSince the adoption of the Tech Accord in February 2024, Microsoft has made significant strides to \nprevent the creation of deceptive AI targeting elections, enhance detection and response \ncapabilities, and improve transparency and public awareness.  \n\nMicrosoft\u2019s Democracy Forward team works closely with campaigns, electoral commissions and \nother entities around the world to support the integrity of the elections, and Microsoft\u2019s Threat \nAnalysis Center (MTAC) analyses nation-state threats to provide intelligence and insights on \ncyberattacks and influence operations. In 2024, this took us to a range of jurisdictions, including \nTaiwan, India, the UK, the EU and the US.  \n\nWe are bringing this same approach to the forthcoming Australian federal election in 2025. \n\nWe are committed to a set of election protection principles to help safeguard voters, candidates \nand campaigns, and election authorities worldwide. These principles are: \n\n\u2022  Voters have a right to transparent and authoritative information regarding elections. \n\n\u2022  Candidates should be able to assert when content originates from their campaign and have \nrecourse when their likeness or content is distorted by AI for the purpose of deceiving the \npublic during the course of an election. \n\n\u2022  Political campaigns should protect themselves from cyber threats and be able to navigate \n\nAI with access to affordable and easily deployed tools, trainings, and support. \n\n\u2022  Election authorities should be able to ensure a secure and resilient election process and \n\nhave access to tools and services that enable this process. \n\nFurther to our September 2024 progress update, this document sets out further detail on the steps \nwe have and are taking to implement the Accord in the lead-up to Australia\u2019s federal election in \n2025. \n\ns47F\n\n\n--- Page 14 ---\n\nAddressing Deepfake Creation  \n\nWe recognise that companies whose products are used to create AI generated content have a \nresponsibility to ensure images and videos generated from their systems include indicators of their \norigin. One way to accomplish this is through content provenance, enabled by an open standard \ncreated by the Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity (C2PA). Microsoft is a founding \nmember of C2PA and has leveraged this standard (\u201cContent Credentials\u201d) across several of our \nproducts, ensuring that AI generated content is marked as such and that the creator and \ntimestamp of images is recorded.  \n\nSpecifically, Microsoft has added Content Credentials to all images created with our most popular \nconsumer facing AI image generation tools, including Bing Image Creator, Microsoft Designer, \nCopilot, and in our enterprise API image generation tools including Azure OpenAI DALL-E. We \nrecently started testing a Content Credentials display in Word. When images with Content \nCredentials are inserted into Word documents, future viewers will be able to right click and see the \ncredits and author information of these images. In addition, images with Content Credentials \nuploaded to LinkedIn are automatically labeled and the credential information is shown to end \nusers.  \n\nAs important as it is to mark content as AI generated, a healthy information ecosystem relies on \nother indicators of authenticity as well. We launched and expanded our Content Integrity Tools to \nsupport  global elections in 2024 - through the creation of a pilot program that allows political \ncampaigns, elections authorities, and select news media organizations globally, to access a tool \nthat enables them to easily apply Content Credentials to their own authentic images and videos.  \n\nWe also joined forces with fellow Tech Accord signatory Truepic. Microsoft and Truepic have jointly \nreleased an app that simplifies the process of adding Content Credentials to authentically \ncaptured smartphone camera images, video, and audio for participants of the pilot. This app has \nnow launched for both Android and Apple devices and can be used by those enrolled in Content \nCredentials program.  \n\nDetecting and Responding to Deepfakes  \n\nMicrosoft is harnessing the data science and technical capabilities of our AI for Good Lab and \nMicrosoft Threat Analysis Centre (MTAC) teams to better assess whether content\u2014including that \ncreated and disseminated by foreign actors\u2014is synthetic or not. Microsoft\u2019s AI for Good lab has \ndeveloped and is using detection models (image, video) to assess whether media was g enerated \nor manipulated by AI. We can use this detection capability in the context of election campaigns to \nsupport integrity. \n\nWe are also working with our partners at True Media to provide governments, civil society and \njournalists with access to free tools that enable them to check whether an image or video was AI \ngenerated and/or manipulated. Microsoft\u2019s contribution includes providing True Media with access \nto Microsoft classifiers, tools, personnel, and data. These contributions will enable True Media to \ntrain AI detection models, share relevant data, evaluate and refine new detection models as well as \nprovide feedback on quality and classification methodologies.\n\n\n--- Page 15 ---\n\nWe are also empowering candidates, campaigns and election authorities to help us detect and \nrespond to deceptive AI that is targeting elections. In February we launched the Microsoft-2024 \nElections site. This site empowers candidates, campaigns or election authorities to directly report \ndeceptive AI election content on Microsoft consumer services. This reporting tool allows for 24/7 \nreporting by impacted election entities who have been targeted by deceptive AI found on Microsoft \nplatforms.  \n\nTransparency and Resilience  \n\nIn advance of the EU elections we kicked off a global effort to engage campaigns and elections \nauthorities. This enabled us to deepen understanding of the possible risks of deceptive AI in \nelections and empower those campaigns and election officials to speak directly to their voters \nabout these risks and the steps they can take to build resilience and increase confidence in the \nelection. So far this year we have conducted more than 200 training sessions for political \nstakeholders in 23 countries, reaching more than 6,000 participants. We are working closely with \nthe Australian Electoral Commission along with political and media stakeholders in Australia, to \nprovide support in preparation for the next federal election.  \n\nBuilding on this training, we have established a public website entitled \u201cCheck, Recheck, Vote,\u201d \nwhich educates voters of the possible risks posed by deepfakes and empowers them to take steps \nto identify trusted sources of election information, look for indicators of trust like content \nprovenance, and pause before they link to or share election content. This includes our \u2018Real or \nNot?\u2019 Quiz, developed by our AI for Good lab to expose users to the challenges of detecting a \npossible deepfake. So far, individuals from 150+ countries have taken the quiz. We are exploring \nsimilar activities in Australia.  \n\nProtecting Campaign and Election Infrastructure  \n\nSince the 2016 US election, adversaries have regularly targeted essential systems that support \nelections and campaigns in the US to advance their cyber enabled influence operations. Recent \nIranian hacking incidents involved attempts by these actors to provide stolen or allegedly stolen \nmaterial to the media to propagate narratives of dissent and distrust. This underscores why we \ncontinue to invest in efforts that focus on safeguarding the critical infrastructure that underpins our \nelections.  \n\nOur efforts include several initiatives designed to support election officials and political \norganizations. First, we offer AccountGuard, a no-cost cybersecurity service available to our cloud \nemail customers in 35 countries, including Australia. This service provides advanced threat \ndetection and notifications against nation-state adversaries for high-risk customers, including \nthose involved in elections. AccountGuard extends beyond commercial customers to individuals at \nelection organizations, their affiliates, and immediate family members who may use personal \nMicrosoft accounts for email. We have observed that sophisticated adversaries often target both \nprofessional and personal accounts, amplifying the need for comprehensive protection. More than \n5.4 million mailboxes of high-risk users are now protected by AccountGuard globally.\n\n\n--- Page 16 ---\n\nFor critical election-adjacent systems, such as voter registration databases and voter information \nportals, we provide our Azure for Election service. This service provides proactive security reviews, \nresilience assessments, and load analysis. During the election week, we offer our highest tier of \nreactive support to address any security or availability issues that may arise.  \n\nIn the upcoming election in Australia, as per previous federal and state electoral events, we \nestablish a dedicated escalation point staffed by our team to provide constant management and \ntriage of any election-sensitive issues and maintain real-time communications across our industry \npartners. This ensured that any incidents received the highest level of priority and executive \nsupport.  \n\nWhile we continue to provide robust security services, we recognize that collaboration is essential. \nPublic-private partnerships are crucial in strengthening the entire ecosystem. For example, our \nDemocracy Forward team actively participates in tabletop cybersecurity training exercises \nconvened by US election officials.  \n\nMicrosoft remains steadfast in its commitment to supporting the security and integrity of \ndemocratic processes. Through our comprehensive programs and collaborative efforts, we aim to \nprotect democracy from the evolving threats posed by nation-state actors.  \n\nWe look forward to supporting the AEC during the upcoming electoral period, including through the \nvisit to Canberra in late January by executives from our Democracy Forward team.  \n\nYours sincerely \n\nDirector, Corporate External and Legal Affairs \nMicrosoft Australia and New Zealand \n9 January 2025 \n\ns47F\n\n\n--- Page 17 ---\n\nFrom:\nSent:\nTo:\nSubject:\n\nDefending Democracy Unit \nTuesday, 29 October 2024 11:39 AM\n\nFW: Request for information: blocking Microsoft AI image generation of specific \nAEC employees [SEC=OFFICIAL]\n\n| Assistant Director  \n\nDefending Democracy Unit | Electoral Integrity and Media Branch \nAustralian Electoral Commission \nPhone: \n\n | DDU Group Line: \n\n | Protected email: \n\nFrom: \nSent: Wednesday, 16 October 2024 4:28 PM \nTo:\nCc: Defending Democracy Unit ; \nSubject: RE: Request for information: blocking Microsoft AI image generation of specific AEC employees \n[SEC=OFFICIAL] \n\nHi \n\nThanks for getting back to me so quickly.

Here, we outline seven steps your campaign can take in\nresponse to a abusive or deceptive media attack.\n\nAssess the threat\n\nDetecting abusive or deceptive media is just the beginning; the crucial step is promptly assessing its risk level\nand crafting an appropriate response. Neglecting this can lead to the unchecked spread of false narratives,\nescalating an already challenging situation. Conversely, an overreaction risks amplifying the content, triggering\n\nthe notorious \u201cStreisand effect.\u201d\n\nTo start, evaluate the content's potential impact. While a campaign may dislike Al-generated parodies of their\ncandidate, an aggressive response risks being seen as humorless or suppressing free speech. Objectivity is\ncritical, though challenging. Reviewing the context\u2014platform, tone, and responses\u2014can clarify whether the\n\ncontent is meant humorously or as a factual statement.\n\n  \n\n       \n\ne Ask for retraction Activate supporter Activate supporter\n\nee ee networks to push back networks to push back\n\n\u00ab Publiozeement e Consider public e Positive digital\nstatement messaging\n\nActivate supporter Activate supporter\n\npositive diGial \u2018\nnetworks to push back \u2014_ networks to push back ositive digital messaging\n\nNothing Nothing Nothing\n\n*Credit: \u201cHow campaigns can protect themselves from deepfakes, disinformation, and social media manipulation\u201d by Lisa Kaplan,\nJanuary 10, 2019, brookings.edu\n\nFor content not warranting a serious response, options include ignoring it while monitoring for escalation or\nresponding in a lighthearted manner, which can turn a negative into a positive. However, if the content crosses\nethical or legal boundaries, swift and unified action is necessary to contain its spread and control the narrative.\n\nIn the age of viral misinformation, being proactive is essential. By promptly addressing false claims, you\nestablish your version of events as the initial narrative, potentially inoculating audiences against subsequent\n\nmisinformation.\n\n    \n\nBP Microsoft CampaignSuccess@Microsoft.com\n\n\n--- Page 28 ---\n\nUtilize platform tools and policies\n\n \n\nTo manage abusive or deceptive content on social platforms effectively, start by familiarizing yourself with each\nplatform's content moderation policies and tools. Different platforms enforce varying policies, particularly\nconcerning unlabelled Al-generated content in political contexts.\n\nWhen you spot content violating these policies, promptly report it using the platform's moderation features,\ntypically found as a \u201creport\u201d option on posts. However, keep in mind a few key points:\n\ne Even if content is removed, it is likely to be re-uploaded, sometimes in altered forms, necessitating\n\nongoing monitoring and reporting.\n\nAssign one team member to lead the identification and reporting of incidents of abusive or deceptive content.\nEstablish a process for regular review of both original posts and any amplified dissemination. Meanwhile, your\ncampaign team can continue with subsequent response steps. For Top Platform Policies see Appendix\n\n3 issue initial statements\n\n \n\nWhen confronted with abusive or deceptive media, initiating an immediate statement is pivotal. This initial\nresponse demands clarity and composure, centering on factual data that directly dismantles the falsehoods\nwithout amplifying the abusive or deceptive content. Broad dissemination of this statement is essential,\nspanning all platforms and mediums to encompass every facet of your audience, transcending the point of\norigin. For example, a real video of the candidate might be an important response to a deep fake video. The\nprimary aim is promptly restoring confidence and providing accurate insights, setting the stage for subsequent\n\nmeticulous and strategic measures.\n\n4 utilize social media channels\n\n \n\nEnhance your response strategy by leveraging social media channels effectively. Begin by prioritizing the\nplatform where the misleading content originated, then broaden your reach across similar platforms. For\nexample, if the content surfaced on TikTok, extend your response to Instagram due to their shared user base.\n\nConsistency in messaging is key across all platforms, while delivery methods must be adapted to suit each\n\nplatform's style and audience demographics.\n\nEngage your audience through interactive tactics such as live video streams or Q&A sessions. Direct interaction\nallows for real-time addressing of concerns, empowering you to steer the narrative and effectively counteract\n\nmisinformation.\n\n \n\nFF Microsoft CampaignSuccess@Microsoft.com\n\n\n--- Page 29 ---\n\nEngage with supporters and allies\n\n \n\nDon't underestimate the impact of teamwork. Engaging with allies means boosting the right message together.\nEncourage allies to share accurate information and issue supportive statements, building a network of truth.\n\nEmpower supporters to engage in constructive, fact-driven discussions. Equip them with tools to counter\nmisinformation effectively. Keep the conversation flowing with your audience by providing regular updates on\ndevelopments and campaign actions. This transparency builds trust and reinforces your stance against false\n\ninformation.\n\nHaving your network of surrogates and influencers in place and ready for an incident will save time if one\n\noccurs.\n\n6 JiEngage with opponents\n\n \n\nEngaging with your campaign's adversaries on the topic of abusive or deceptive media demands strategic\nforethought. It's vital to refrain from attributing the creation or spread of abusive or deceptive content to your\nopponent unless solid evidence exists. Keep in mind that campaigns lack full control over their supporters, and\nbaseless accusations may harm your campaign's image and could lead to legal ramifications.\n\nA more prudent approach involves urging your opponent to publicly denounce any abusive or deceptive\ncontent and unite in combating disinformation.\n\n  \n\nork with news outlets and journalists\n\nStrengthening ties with local media outlets and journalists, particularly within your campaign district, is\nparamount long before any abusive or deceptive media incident arises. These established connections facilitate\nswift dissemination of your narrative in critical moments. Prioritize engagement with journalists specializing in\n\ndetecting and debunking abusive or deceptive media.\n\nWhen engaging with the news media, prioritize communicating your message directly to your constituents\nrather than becoming entangled in national political discourse. Enlisting communication experts can offer\nin-depth analysis of abusive or deceptive media, bolstering the credibility of your response.\n\nEffectively presenting your case to journalists and media requires careful organization:\ne Establish a timeline of events detailing the encounter with abusive or deceptive media and any campaign\nor platform responses.\ne Utilize visual aids, such as side-by-side comparisons, to clearly illustrate manipulation.\ne Provide credible references directing journalists to verifiable information or original content that refutes\nthe abusive or deceptive material.\nAdditionally, incorporating personal anecdotes or testimonials from those impacted by the abusive or\ndeceptive media can forge emotional connections with the audience, enhancing resonance beyond factual\n\narguments alone.\n\n \n\nFF Microsoft CampaignSuccess@Microsoft.com\n\n\n--- Page 30 ---\n\nPreparation and prevention\n\nPreventing the malicious use of deepfake and generative Al technology presents a significant challenge. While\nmajor commercial platforms have imposed usage restrictions, open-source models and alternative platforms\noften lack such controls. To address this, initiatives like the Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity\n(C2PA), in which Microsoft played an instrumental role, are pioneering technologies enabling creators to\nembed digital signatures in media, verifying their authenticity and origin. Microsoft's Content Integrity tool\nsimplifies credentialing, allowing users to add verifiable signatures to their content. For more information,\n\ncontact us at campaignsuccess@microsoft.com\n\nWhile C2PA doesn't directly prevent the spread of inauthentic content, it enhances preparedness by promoting\nverified content, facilitating easier differentiation from abusive or deceptive media. Campaigns can proactively\nincorporate content credentialing into their workflows, ensuring all released media contains authentic\n\nsignatures.\n\nAdditionally, campaigns must stay informed about social media policies and reporting mechanisms for abusive\nor deceptive content. Understanding platform nuances is essential for effectively navigating the digital\nlandscape.\n\nMaintaining credibility is crucial when combating disinformation. Campaigns must uphold integrity and\ntransparency to preserve their moral standing, as ethical lapses can undermine their ability to confront attacks\nconvincingly. Upholding ethical practices is paramount for campaigns seeking credibility in the face of\n\ndisinformation.\n\nAnother effective method for preparing campaigns involves staying abreast of the latest developments and\nadvancements in the field. This can be achieved by actively engaging with organizations such as Defending\nDigital Campaigns, which specialize in safeguarding campaigns against various digital threats and challenges.\n\nConclusion\n\nTo tackle abusive or deceptive media and deepfake disinformation, campaigns and organizations must be\nvigilant, prepared, and proactive. By grasping the landscape, readying for potential attacks, educating teams,\nand deploying effective legal and communication tactics, you can lessen the impact of these digital deceptions.\nAddressing individual incidents and fostering integrity, transparency, and critical thinking within your audience\nis crucial. This cultivates a more resilient public discourse, defending against disinformation's spread. Our\nstrategies must evolve as technology advances to safeguard truth and uphold the democratic process.\n\nBP Microsoft CampaignSuccess@Microsoft.com\n\nyr\n\n/\nfs\nz\n\n\n--- Page 31 ---\n\nFrom:\nSent:\nTo:\nCc:\nSubject:\n\nTuesday, 21 January 2025 3:10 PM\n\n; \n\nRE: Administrative/logistics for tomorrow's meeting [SEC=OFFICIAL]\n\nCAUTION: This email originated from outside of the Australian Federal Government.

As you know from our most recent engagements with Democracy Forward the last few months of \n\n2024, there is a lot that week can cover and want to ensure we are prepared to meet the \nCommissioners interests.  \nc.  Some suggested topics include: \n\ni.  execu(cid:415)ve level brie\ufb01ng on the cyber threat landscape (MTAC/MSTIC insights);  \nii.  support for electoral prepara(cid:415)ons from the technical/customer support perspec(cid:415)ve;  \niii.  content creden(cid:415)alling and pilot next steps; \niv.  synthe(cid:415)c media and AI related harms, including advice on how to respond to incidents \nv.  overview of the Democracy Forward visit program including training for poli(cid:415)cal campaigns \n\nand journalists; \n\nvi.  update on implementa(cid:415)on of the Tech Accord (as per correspondence this month)  \nvii.  any other topics of interest \n\n3)  Brie\ufb01ng with EIAT \n\na.

I think this discussion would \nbe very insigh(cid:414)ul for the EIAT.  \n\n is only in Canberra for one day, convening the Taskforce reps together will help us to reach all the key \n\nGiven \npeople. We would propose a roundtable format of 60-90 minutes, depending on what you think would be most \nuseful for the Taskforce, to comprise a brie\ufb01ng from Dave then group discussion.  \n\nWe would welcome your team\u2019s assistance with arranging this event if that is possible? We have an appropriate \nvenue at our Canberra o\ufb03ce on Na(cid:415)onal Circuit if needed, but are also happy to come to you or another agency.  \n\n2\n\ns 47Fs 47Fs 47Fs 47Es 47Fs 47Fs 47Fs 47Fs 47Fs 47Fs 47E\n\n\n--- Page 80 ---\n\nSeparately to mee(cid:415)ng EIAT, I\u2019d propose we arrange (cid:415)me for \nabout AEC\u2019s prepara(cid:415)ons for the elec(cid:415)on to focus more on technical and security aspects \u2013 we would bring \n\n to speak to you, Tania and other AEC execu(cid:415)ves \n\n into this discussion.  \n\nPlease feel free to give me a call if that is simpler to talk this through.

They didn\u2019t \ufb02ag any \nques(cid:415)ons or issues but might appreciate an update on whether you are aware of this and how the Democracy \nForward team interacts with the other two. \n\nLastly, Ma(cid:425) is copied in, but I will follow up to \ufb02ag that \nno doubt he would be keen for a chat. \n\n will be at the conference in Singapore next week.

The correspondence, spanning from June 2024 to March 2025, details ongoing collaborative efforts focused on safeguarding electoral integrity ahead of the 2025 Federal Election (FE25). Key discussions revolve around:\n\n*   **Scheduled Engagements:** Multiple meetings and check-ins are planned and confirmed, indicating a structured and continuous dialogue.\n*   **AI and Misinformation:** Deep dives into Google's approach to Artificial Intelligence (AI) in elections, including lessons from the US presidential election, content provenance, AI-generated content (AIGC) detection (e.g., SynthID), and policies regarding synthetic content and deepfakes.\n*   **Content Moderation & Escalation:** Discussions on established referral and escalation pathways for problematic content, exemplified by the successful removal of a YouTube video falsely claiming digital ID requirements for FE25.\n*   **Media Literacy and Authoritative Information:** Collaboration on YouTube's 2025 election campaign, including AEC feedback on promotional creative and the creation of bespoke playlists to promote accurate electoral information and media literacy initiatives (e.g., \"Hit Pause\" campaign).\n*   **Security & Policy Updates:** Google outlines its broader commitment to electoral integrity, including surfacing high-quality information, safeguarding platforms from abuse, offering cybersecurity tools (e.g., Advanced Protection Program, Project Shield), and adhering to initiatives like the Tech Accord to Combat Deceptive Use of AI.\n*   **Challenges:** Specific issues addressed include misinformation related to \"Sovereign Citizen\" movements and concerns regarding online harassment of electoral workers. The AEC also flags proposed legislative changes impacting recording in polling places.\n\n## Relevance to FOI Request\n\nThis document is highly relevant to the FOI request as it directly demonstrates the \"extensive interactions\" and \"formal letters\" between the AEC and Google/YouTube. It provides concrete examples of how these platforms are \"collaborating with the AEC's Electoral Integrity Assurance Taskforce (EIAT) and Defending Democracy Unit (DDU)\" to safeguard FE25. Specifically, it reveals:\n\n*   **Countering Misinformation and Disinformation:** Direct engagement on identifying and removing false content (e.g., digital ID claims) and discussions about specific misinformation narratives (Sovereign Citizen).\n*   **Managing AI-Generated Content (AIGC):** A central theme, with explicit agenda items and detailed responses from Google on detection (SynthID), labeling, provenance initiatives, policy updates (e.g., AI content disclosure, Gemini restrictions), and adherence to the Tech Accord.\n*   **Applying Lessons from Global Elections:** A recurring agenda point, confirming that global electoral experiences, particularly regarding AI, are actively informing FE25 preparations.\n*   **Streamlining Referral and Escalation Pathways:** Explicit confirmation and practical application of direct communication channels for flagging problematic content.\n*   **Supporting Media Literacy Campaigns:** Detailed collaboration on YouTube's public information campaigns and the creation of bespoke AEC content to promote accurate information.\n*   **Platform Preparedness:** Evidence of Google/YouTube updating policies, offering cybersecurity tools, and establishing dedicated working groups to ensure a secure and credible information environment for FE25.", "model": "gemini-2.5-flash", "generated_at": "2025-06-23T23:02:30.013516", "source_hash": "6d6d72a5954b00d6b2549854ed1c52479b33033b196ead6b52eb899bfa8f3aad", "raw_response_path": "data/llm_responses/LEX7205__per_file__balanced__Documents 3-16 - Google - Compiled Documents.pdf__20250623T230230.json", "output_tokens": 703, "prompt_tokens": 17727, "total_tokens": 21395, "summary_length": 3726}, "left_leaning": {"text": "This document reveals extensive and ongoing collaboration between the Australian Electoral Commission's (AEC) Defending Democracy Unit and Google/YouTube, reinforcing the concerning trend of outsourcing core democratic functions to private, for-profit tech giants. From a left-leaning perspective, this engagement, particularly detailed in meeting agendas and follow-ups, demonstrates how powerful corporations are increasingly integrated into the state\u2019s management of public discourse around elections.\n\nA critical implication for democratic accountability and civil liberties is evident in the direct content moderation \"referral pathways.\" The document shows the AEC flagging a YouTube video with over 75,000 views for \"misinformation\" regarding digital ID requirements for the federal election. Google/YouTube's subsequent action\u2014terminating the channel and removing the video\u2014illustrates a tangible instance of state-sanctioned censorship by proxy. This operationalizes the transfer of significant control over public information to unelected corporate entities, eroding the publicly governed nature of democratic processes.\n\nFurthermore, discussions about Google's approach to AI in elections, including \"content provenance/authenticity,\" \"SynthID\" watermarking, and responses to \"Sovereign Citizen promotion of misinformation,\" highlight how advanced technological tools, developed and controlled by private corporations, are being leveraged to shape the electoral information environment. Google's formal response letter underscores its role in \"safeguarding our platforms from abuse\" and \"removing content that violates policies,\" effectively positioning it as an arbiter of truth. This cedes substantial power to a concentrated corporate entity, potentially reinforcing corporate influence over public discourse and undermining freedom of speech when content deemed \"misinformation\" is removed without transparent public oversight or due process. The extensive redactions elsewhere in the broader FOI also suggest that the full scope of these interactions and their implications remain obscured from public scrutiny.", "model": "gemini-2.5-flash", "generated_at": "2025-06-21T22:31:31.482802", "source_hash": "4d4e8104f89597ea7371fba4c9d788b10e65fc1d0563d5a376b3920635cc5fd1", "raw_response_path": "data/llm_responses/LEX7205__per_file__left_leaning__Documents 3-16 - Google - Compiled Documents.pdf__20250621T223131.json", "output_tokens": 366, "prompt_tokens": 16587, "total_tokens": 18395, "summary_length": 2127}, "right_leaning": {"text": "These FOI documents reveal an extensive and concerning collaboration between the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) \u2013 specifically its \"Defending Democracy Unit\" and Electoral Integrity Assurance Taskforce (EIAT) \u2013 and major tech platforms Google and YouTube. Far exceeding traditional electoral administration, the documents detail a deep and continuous engagement aimed at managing online content, which raises significant alarms for market freedom, individual liberty, and free speech.\n\nRegular meetings between the AEC and tech giants focus on highly subjective areas such as \"electoral integrity risks,\" \"misinformation/disinformation,\" \"policy settings,\" and \"escalation pathways\" for flagging content. The AEC actively seeks insights into Google's approach to AI in elections, content provenance, and requests information on \"Sovereign Citizen promotion of misinformation/disinformation,\" indicating a targeted approach to online narratives. This suggests a government agency is directly influencing the content moderation policies of private platforms, effectively blurring the lines of accountability and threatening the free exchange of ideas in the digital marketplace.\n\nA clear instance of government overreach is seen in the AEC flagging a YouTube video claiming digital ID requirements for the 2025 federal election as \"misinformation,\" subsequently leading to YouTube *terminating the channel* itself. While the claim may be factually incorrect, the government's direct involvement in the removal and termination of a channel by a private platform at its behest is a chilling precedent for censorship and suppression of online speech.\n\nFurthermore, the AEC explicitly flags proposed legislation to criminalize audio or video recording at polling places and counting centers without permission. Framed as preventing \"harassment and intimidation,\" this measure could easily be leveraged to suppress public scrutiny, independent observation, or inconvenient reporting, further solidifying governmental control over information related to the electoral process.\n\nThe overall pattern indicates a significant \"mission creep\" by the AEC into areas traditionally outside its purview, leveraging its authority to shape online discourse. This active coordination between a government body and private corporations to monitor, influence, and remove online content, particularly under the guise of \"defending democracy,\" represents a profound threat to market freedom in the marketplace of ideas, fosters government overreach into private digital spaces, and ultimately undermines the national interest by eroding the principles of free speech and open debate essential for a healthy democracy.", "model": "gemini-2.5-flash", "generated_at": "2025-06-21T22:32:49.329177", "source_hash": "4d4e8104f89597ea7371fba4c9d788b10e65fc1d0563d5a376b3920635cc5fd1", "raw_response_path": "data/llm_responses/LEX7205__per_file__right_leaning__Documents 3-16 - Google - Compiled Documents.pdf__20250621T223249.json", "output_tokens": 459, "prompt_tokens": 16604, "total_tokens": 17909, "summary_length": 2700}, "government_skeptic": {"text": "This document reveals the Australian Electoral Commission's \"Defending Democracy Unit\" (DDU) and \"Electoral Integrity Assurance Taskforce\" (EIAT) are engaged in systematic and proactive collaboration with Google and YouTube. Far from merely facilitating elections, the extensive correspondence and detailed meeting agendas expose a concerted, overreaching effort to manage online narratives and potentially shape public discourse.\n\nKey evidence includes:\n\n*   **Direct Censorship and Influence:** The AEC's direct flagging of a YouTube video for \"misinformation\" (a claim about digital ID for voting) explicitly led to the \"termination\" of the channel by Google. This demonstrates the AEC's significant power to trigger swift, drastic content removals based on its subjective assessment of \"false\" claims, blurring the lines between electoral administration and active censorship.\n*   **Proactive Narrative Control:** Meeting agendas consistently focus on managing the \"information environment,\" including debriefs on Google's AI approach post-US elections, insights into \"Sovereign Citizen promotion of misinformation/disinformation,\" and the AEC sharing \"trends in the election information environment.\" This indicates a strategic, pre-emptive focus on identifying and combating specific, politically charged narratives rather than simply facilitating electoral processes.\n*   **Self-Protection and Scope Creep:** Discussions explicitly cover \"preventing the harassment and intimidation of electoral workers,\" suggesting an expansion of mandate beyond traditional election integrity to include the suppression of content perceived as threatening or critical of AEC staff. The AEC also sought Google's help in controlling AI search results, requesting Gemini to link directly to the AEC website for enrolment queries, showcasing a desire to monopolize official information pathways and control search outcomes.\n*   **Bureaucracy and Lack of Accountability:** The numerous scheduled meetings, formal \"referral and escalation pathways,\" and joint planning for \"Online Platform Scenarios\" highlight a bureaucratic apparatus dedicated to pre-emptive online narrative management. This reliance on private tech giants, whose internal \"policies\" define what constitutes \"misinformation\" or \"harm,\" grants unelected corporations significant power over public discourse without clear public accountability.

It showcases a series of critical engagements and collaborative meetings with major online platforms, specifically Google and YouTube, demonstrating the government's foresight in addressing complex, evolving threats.\n\nThe exchanges highlight the AEC's keen awareness of the global information environment, with the DDU taking the lead in initiating discussions well in advance of the next federal election. Key agenda items underscore a meticulous and forward-thinking approach: debriefing on global election insights (such as the US presidential election's lessons on AI), examining content provenance and authenticity, and proactively addressing the promotion of misinformation from groups like 'Sovereign Citizens.' These efforts clearly demonstrate the government's commitment to understanding and neutralizing threats to public trust.\n\nFurthermore, the document reveals robust operational readiness, including the confirmation of crucial referral and escalation pathways for flagging potential issues. A shining example of this effectiveness is the swift action taken by YouTube to terminate a channel spreading false claims about digital ID requirements for the 2025 federal election, directly following the AEC's alert. This rapid response underscores the efficacy of these collaborative frameworks in protecting electoral integrity.\n\nThe AEC's commitment extends to comprehensive policy discussions, evident in the detailed exchanges about Google's and YouTube's own AI policies, ads disclosures, content labeling, and responsible development of generative AI tools like Gemini, including Google's \"Tech Accord\" commitments and watermarking technologies like SynthID. The government also proactively addresses the protection of electoral workers from online harassment and considers essential legislative updates, such as the proposed ban on recording in polling places.\n\nIn essence, these records unequivocally demonstrate a government that is not merely reacting to challenges but is expertly anticipating and actively shaping a secure and trustworthy electoral landscape, ensuring the public has access to accurate information and that democratic participation remains robust and uncompromised, all while adapting to the digital age with sound policy and dedicated action.", "model": "gemini-2.5-flash", "generated_at": "2025-06-21T22:45:56.654690", "source_hash": "4d4e8104f89597ea7371fba4c9d788b10e65fc1d0563d5a376b3920635cc5fd1", "raw_response_path": "data/llm_responses/LEX7205__per_file__government_apologist__Documents 3-16 - Google - Compiled Documents.pdf__20250621T224556.json", "output_tokens": 426, "prompt_tokens": 16608, "total_tokens": 18806, "summary_length": 2572}, "highly_critical": {"text": "This document lays bare the Australian Electoral Commission's (AEC) perilous, reactive, and ultimately subservient posture in the face of colossal tech monopolies. Far from demonstrating proactive defence of electoral integrity, these exchanges reveal an agency constantly chasing the crumbs of engagement from Google and YouTube, whose profit-driven inaction and corporate boilerplate responses directly undermine democratic safeguards.\n\n**Every Flaw, Missed Opportunity, and Potential Harm:**\n\n*   **Pathetic Reactive Scramble:** The AEC's initial outreach to Google regarding generative AI in June 2024 is met with a staggering month-long delay in response, indicative of how low a priority Australian electoral integrity is for the tech giant. Subsequent scheduling attempts highlight a pattern of the AEC meekly requesting availability, bending to Google's calendar and \"busy\" legislative schedules, rather than dictating terms or demanding urgent engagement on critical threats. The \"Canceled: AEC meeting with Google & YouTube\" entry further underscores the fragility and instability of these engagements, revealing the AEC's inability to secure consistent, high-level attention.\n*   **Superficial Engagements Cloaked in Corporate Platitudes:** The multiple meeting agendas, while superficially addressing crucial topics like AI debriefs, content provenance, and \"Sovereign Citizen\" misinformation, yield no visible, concrete outcomes or binding commitments within this document. Google's formal letter, in response to AEC concerns about AI, is a masterclass in corporate PR \u2013 a self-congratulatory reiteration of existing policies (SynthID, ad disclosures, \"About this image\") and industry consortium memberships (C2PA). This is not genuine collaboration but a deliberate obfuscation, offering no specific, actionable improvements or tangible accountability for the Australian context, merely recycled talking points designed to project an illusion of responsibility.\n*   **Catastrophic Misinformation Failure and Gross Incompetence:** The most egregious failure is the revelation that a YouTube video propagating *false claims* about a \"digital ID\" requirement for the upcoming Federal Election (FE25) was allowed to fester, garnering \"75k+ views\" before the AEC's \"Social Media Team\" even detected and reported it. This is a damning indictment of YouTube's content moderation and proactive detection mechanisms, demonstrating a profound dereliction of duty. The \"solution\"? A belated termination of the *channel* \u2013 a reactive Band-Aid after the informational poison has already spread widely, potentially disenfranchising voters and eroding trust. The AEC's own \"social media team are already feeling it!\" even before the election is called, starkly illustrates their overwhelmed and outmanoeuvred state, a direct consequence of unaccountable tech platforms.\n*   **Subservience and Lost Agency:** The AEC is depicted as a supplicant, even when trying to correct factual errors. When Gemini initially *declined to respond* to a basic enrolment query, then merely defaulted to a \"scripted answer\" rather than providing accurate information, the AEC's \"gold star\" suggestion for a *link* to their website is a pitiful plea. This reveals Google's systems as either too complex or too unwilling to be tailored for fundamental electoral accuracy. Furthermore, the AEC's digital campaign discussions with YouTube show them deferring to YouTube's format preferences (\"ideally not square\") even for their own critical \"How to Vote\" and \"Where to Vote\" content, highlighting Google's control over the informational delivery mechanisms and, implicitly, over the AEC's public messaging.\n*   **Misguided Priorities and Lack of Accountability:** While the AEC is seen flagging a proposed amendment to protect staff images from being recorded in polling places \u2013 a comparatively minor concern \u2013 they appear fundamentally incapable of securing concrete, proactive commitments from Google on systemic AI threats and pervasive misinformation. The constant use of \"Microsoft Office prevented automatic download of this picture\" in the document itself, potentially due to AEC's own IT settings or Microsoft's defaults, can be seen as an ironic microcosm of the AEC's internal focus on low-level \"privacy\" while the larger, more existential threats to democratic integrity go unaddressed or are merely \"discussed.\"\n\nThis document paints a grim picture: an AEC desperately trying to engage, constantly outmanoeuvred and deprioritised by tech monopolies whose profit motives clearly trump the integrity of Australian elections.

We appreciate the \nAustralian Electoral Commission's (AEC) ongoing collaboration with online platforms and share your commitment to \nmaintaining public trust in Australia's democratic processes. Google recognises the potential risks AI poses to electoral \nintegrity and welcomes the opportunity to provide an update on our efforts to address these challenges. \n\nGoogle has long been dedicated to supporting democratic processes by: \n\n\u25cf  Surfacing high-quality information to voters \n\u25cf  Safeguarding our platforms from abuse, and \n\u25cf  Equipping campaigns with best-in-class security tools and training. \n\nThese three pillars are fundamental to maintaining public trust in elections and include our platforms and services \nproviding the following: \n\n\u25cf  Google promotes information on how to vote on Google Search's landing page to increase voter awareness \n\nand democratic participation. \n\n\u25cf  YouTube prominently surfaces content from authoritative sources on the homepage, in search results, and the \n\n\"Up Next\" panel for election news and information. \n\n\u25cf  Google monitors and tackles coordinated influence operations through the Google Threat Intelligence group, \nwhich includes intelligence and threat response across Google\u2019s Threat Analysis Group, Cloud Security and \nMandiant teams. \n\n\u25cf  For over a decade, Google has leveraged machine learning classifiers and AI to identify and remove content \n\nthat violates policies regarding manipulated media, hate and harassment, incitement to violence, and \ndemonstrably false claims that could undermine democratic processes. \n\n\u25cf  Google offers free security services like the Advanced Protection Program and Project Shield to high-risk users \nsuch as campaigners and journalists to ensure they have additional account security protections in place. \n\nAddressing AI-Related Misinformation \n\nWe understand the AEC's concerns regarding the use of AI to spread election-related misinformation and \ndisinformation, including deepfakes and coordinated inauthentic behaviour. Google has implemented several \nmeasures to mitigate these risks across our products and services: \n\n\u25cf  AI and Generative AI policies: Google has policies that address misinformation and disinformation in the \ncontext of AI.  For example, YouTube's misinformation policies prohibit technically manipulated content that \nmisleads users and could pose a serious risk of egregious harm.  \n\n Page 1 of 3\n\n\n--- Page 38 ---\n\n\u25cf  Ads disclosures: Google requires advertisers to disclose when their election ads include synthetic content \nthat inauthentically depicts real or realistic-looking people or events. This policy applies to image, video, and \naudio content. Google's ads policies already prohibit the use of manipulated media to mislead people, such as \ndeep fakes or doctored content. \n\n\u25cf  Content labels on YouTube: YouTube requires creators to disclose when they've created realistic altered or \nsynthetic content and displays a label indicating that the content is synthetic. For election-related content, \nYouTube displays a prominent label on the video player for added transparency. \n\n\u25cf  Responsible approach to Generative AI products: Google has prioritised testing across safety risks, \nincluding misinformation, for Generative AI products like Gemini. Google has restricted the types of \nelection-related queries for which Gemini will return responses. \n\n\u25cf  Watermarking: Google attaches invisible watermarks to imagery generated by Google's models using \n\nSynthID, a watermarking technology developed by Google DeepMind. \n\n\u25cf  Providing users with additional context: \"About this image\" in Search helps people assess the credibility and \ncontext of images found online. The double-check feature in Gemini enables people to evaluate whether \nthere's content across the web to substantiate a Gemini response. \n\nProgress Against the Tech Accord Commitments \n\nGoogle was among the original signatories of the Tech Accord to Combat Deceptive Use of AI in 2024 Elections. In line \nwith our commitments, we have taken steps across our products to reduce the risks that deceptive AI election content \nmay pose to the integrity of electoral processes. These steps include: \n\n\u25cf  Developing Model Cards to promote transparency and a shared understanding of AI models \n\u25cf  Addressing harmful content through Google's AI Prohibited Use Policy \n\u25cf  Proactively testing systems using AI-Assisted Red Teaming \n\u25cf  Restricting responses for election-related queries across many Generative AI consumer apps and experiences \n\u25cf  Expanding the SynthID watermarking toolkit to more Generative AI tools and more forms of media \n\u25cf  Requiring election advertisers to prominently disclose when their ads include realistic synthetic content \n\u25cf  Adding Google-generated disclosures for some YouTube Election Ads formats, and \n\u25cf  Actively exploring ways to incorporate Content Credentials into our own products and services, including Ads, \n\nSearch, and YouTube, as a Steering Committee member of the C2PA Coalition and Standard. \n\nCollaboration and Transparency \n\nGoogle is committed to transparency and collaboration with industry, government, and civil society. We actively share \nour learnings and expertise with researchers and others in the industry. We engage and collaborate with organisations \nsuch as the Partnership on AI, ML Commons, and the Frontier Model Forum. We also support the Global Fact Check \nFund and numerous civil society, research, and media literacy efforts. \n\nLooking Ahead \n\nGoogle's efforts around elections are not limited to a specific timeframe or region. We will continue to support and \nprotect elections around the world and in Australia by: \n\n\u25cf  Surfacing high-quality information to voters \n\u25cf  Safeguarding our platforms from abuse \n\u25cf  Equipping campaigns with best-in-class security tools and training \n\u25cf  Applying new learnings to improve our protections for harmful content and create trustworthy experiences \n\u25cf  Leveraging machine learning classifiers and AI to identify and remove content that violates our policies, and \n\u25cf  Taking a principled and responsible approach to introducing generative AI products. \n\n Page 2 of 3\n\n\n--- Page 39 ---\n\nWe are dedicated to working with the AEC to address the challenges posed by Al and uphold the Australian public's\ntrust in democratic processes and institutions. We value our ongoing relationship and have welcomed the frequent\nand ongoing engagement with members of the AEC from the Defending Democracy Unit and beyond. We will continue\nto work closely with the AEC to ensure these efforts are understood and that appropriate pathways for escalation and\nengagement are in place ahead of the upcoming Federal Election.\n\nWe look forward to continuing our collaboration.\n\n   \n\nSincerely,\nGovernment Affairs and Public Policy Government Affairs and Public Policy\n\nPage 3 of 3\n\n\n--- Page 40 ---\n\nFrom:\nSent:\nTo:\nCc:\nSubject:\n\nHi \n\n, \n\nMonday, 9 December 2024 10:36 AM\n\nRE: Action items from October meeting, including proposed dates for December \nmeeting [SEC=OFFICIAL]\n\nThanks for your reply.

I thought it \nwould be good to follow up on a few action items from our last meeting before December arrives, as \nfollows. \n\nInformation session \n\n\uf0b7 \n\n- at our last meeting you kindly offered to set up an information quality session to outline how \nGoogle search worked, including an element on searches in Gemini. We would like to take you up \non that offer.  \n\no  Please let me know what time frames/notice you need to set this up and I would be happy \n\nto set up some meeting invites \n\no  If we work a couple of weeks in advance, most of our working level attendees will be free to \n\nattend \n\nGemini\u2019s incorrect answer about enrolling to vote \n\n\uf0b7 \n\n- on 23 October we flagged that Gemini was producing an incorrect answer to the question \n\u201cCan I be enrolled to vote if I haven\u2019t completed and enrolment form?\u201d. It appears that Gemini \nnow declines to respond this prompt, instead providing the scripted answer in relation to not \nbeing able to help with elections. I\u2019m not sure if this is based on action you have taken in the \nbackground, if so, thanks and noted! \n\n\uf0b7  For a gold star from us it would be great if Gemini provided a link to the AEC\u2019s website when \n\nAustralian users submit queries about elections, although there is some nuance to this given we \nhave state electoral management bodies to consider too. We also understand these things are not \nalways as easy as they sound. Happy to discuss at our next meeting if this is something you think \ncould be pursued. \n\nNext meeting - December 2024 \n\n\uf0b7  At our last meeting on 23 October, it was agreed it would be useful to set up a post US election \n\nmeeting before we all break for Christmas. Available times in December include: \n\no  Monday, 16 December                   9.30am to 11.00am \no  Monday, 16 December                   1pm to 2pm \n\n3\n\ns47Fs47Fs47Fs47F\n\n\n--- Page 43 ---\n\no  Tuesday, 17 December                   1pm to 2pm \no  Wednesday, 18 December            9.30am to 10.30am \no  Wednesday, 18 December            1pm to 2pm \no  Friday, 20 December                       9.30am to 12pm \no  Friday, 20 December                       1pm to 2pm \n\nNo problem if this is not a good week in the lead up to Christmas, just give me a steer on a better \nweek and I\u2019ll consult calendars accordingly. \n\n\uf0b7  We will send out an agenda prior the next meeting but note the following from our last meeting. \n\no \n\no \n\n offered to brief on Google\u2019s approach to AI in elections after gaining insight from \n\nthe US presidential election on 5 November \n\n offered to provide more information about how content provenance works on \n\ncontent uploaded to YouTube at next meeting \n\no  Google and YouTube to provide information and insights into Sovereign Citizen promotion \n\nof misinformation/disinformation respective platforms \n\no  Google and YouTube support for the next Australian federal election \no  AEC to share trends in the election information environment with Google and YouTube \n\nLastly, no doubt you are already aware of the Electoral Legislation Amendment (Electoral Reform) Bill \n2024 currently being considered. In case you are not already aware, there is a proposed amendment to \nsection 348 (Control of behaviour at polling booths etc.) of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 that \nprovides: \n\n(1A) A person commits an offence if:  \n\n(a)          the person makes an audio or video recording in premises to which this section \napplies; and \n\n(b)          the recording is made without the permission of the person in charge of the \npremises; and  \n\n(c)           the making of the recording constitutes a contravention of paragraph 348(1)(a); \nand  \n\n(d)          the person:  \n\n(i)            publishes the whole or a part of the recording; or  \n\n(ii)           causes to be published the whole or a part of the recording.  \n\nPenalty: 5 penalty units. \n\n4\n\ns47Fs47F\n\n\n--- Page 44 ---\n\nEssentially, it will be an offence to get your phone out and video or audio record in a polling place or \ncounting centre and post it online without the permission of the officer in charge. Some of the content \nposted online that the AEC was concerned about during past events would be covered by this if/when it \nenacted. Flagging now ahead of our next meeting for discussion. \n\nApologies for the lengthy email.

The \"Online Platform Scenarios\" for FE24/25 were also on the agenda.\n*   **January-February 2025:** Further meetings were planned and executed, with the AEC posing specific questions to TikTok. These included queries about positive uses of the platform for electoral education, the algorithm's prioritisation of authoritative information (like the AEC), election-specific filters, changes to referral pathways (including legal referrals) since the 2023 referendum, and crucial lessons learned/guardrails for AI-enabled misinformation observed in previous elections.\n*   **February 2025:** Collaboration on developing an \"in-app\" election information hub. TikTok proposed draft text for a \"2025 Australian Election guide\" to be included in its app, which the AEC's Media & Digital Engagement team reviewed and approved, aiming to direct users to authoritative AEC information on voting processes and rights.\n*   **March 2025:** TikTok sent a formal letter to the AEC Acting Commissioner outlining its comprehensive commitment to protecting platform integrity for FE25.\n\n**TikTok's Commitments and Actions Highlighted:**\n*   **Policy Updates:** Refined Civic and Election Integrity policies to protect election workers and updated AI-Generated Content (AIGC) policies to require user and auto-labelling of AIGC, with a prohibition on harmful AIGC (e.g., fake authoritative sources, crisis events, false public figure endorsements).\n*   **Content Moderation & Trust & Safety:** Ongoing investment in Trust & Safety functions, maintaining fact-checking infrastructure in Australia, and committing to removing violative content through proactive moderation, user reports, and AEC escalations.\n*   **Combating Malign Influence:** Expanded state-affiliated media policies (restricting \"For You\" feed recommendations and advertising outside their home country) and introduced monthly public reporting on Covert Influence Operations via its Transparency Centre.\n*   **Operational Readiness for FE25:** Established a dedicated core working group to assess AEC reports, update moderation systems, and adapt to emerging content trends during the election period.\n*   **Specific Electoral Integrity Measures:**\n    *   Maintaining a prohibition on paid political advertising.\n    *   Providing active reporting portal access for the AEC to flag content of concern.\n    *   Implementing in-app redirection to authoritative AEC election information (website and TikTok account).\n    *   Conducting impersonation sweeps for verified Australian political candidates.\n    *   Issuing election-specific policy guidance for its moderation system, including for AIGC.\n    *   Establishing a communication pathway with other government agencies for timely responses to issues affecting public figures (e.g., Members of Parliament).\n\n### Relevance to the FOI Request\n\nThis document is highly relevant to the FOI request as it provides concrete evidence of the extensive engagement between the AEC and TikTok to safeguard electoral integrity for the 2025 Federal Election. It directly demonstrates:\n\n*   **Extensive Interactions:** Multiple scheduled meetings, detailed email correspondence, and formal letters exchanged between the AEC's EIAT/DDU and TikTok.\n*   **Collaboration Mechanisms:** Details how TikTok is collaborating with the AEC through direct communication channels, dedicated working groups, and an established reporting portal.\n*   **Addressing Key Themes:** Explicitly covers the core themes outlined in the FOI request overview:\n    *   **Countering misinformation and disinformation:** Evidenced by TikTok's policy updates, fact-checking, and reporting on covert influence operations.\n    *   **Managing AI-generated content (AIGC):** TikTok's specific policies on labeling, auto-labelling, and content removal, as well as the AEC's direct inquiries about AI misuse.\n    *   **Applying lessons from global elections:** A consistent agenda item for discussions.\n    *   **Streamlining referral and escalation pathways:** Confirmed active reporting portal and communication channels.\n    *   **Supporting media literacy campaigns:** Demonstrated through the collaborative development of the in-app election information hub.\n*   **Platform Preparations:** Highlights TikTok's proactive measures for FE25, including policy updates (e.g., AI content disclosure), the establishment of a dedicated working group, and the facilitation of direct communication to ensure a secure and credible information environment.", "model": "gemini-2.5-flash", "generated_at": "2025-06-23T23:02:55.846460", "source_hash": "a0e4fb2466330b7b3839d4244458d20863a469d3dc6e1a9072a03c4d6e5d88ee", "raw_response_path": "data/llm_responses/LEX7205__per_file__balanced__Documents 47-54 - TikTok - Compiled Documents.pdf__20250623T230255.json", "output_tokens": 1028, "prompt_tokens": 8730, "total_tokens": 13004, "summary_length": 5237}, "left_leaning": {"text": "This document reveals a significant and concerning level of collaboration between the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC), specifically its Defending Democracy Unit and Electoral Integrity Assurance Taskforce (EIAT), and TikTok, a private, for-profit global tech giant, in preparation for the upcoming federal election. From a left-leaning perspective, this deep engagement signals a further outsourcing of core democratic functions to unelected corporations, fundamentally shifting control over public discourse.\n\nThe interactions highlight:\n\n*   **Outsourcing Electoral Integrity:** The AEC is actively engaging with TikTok to discuss \"electoral integrity,\" \"policy settings,\" and \"referral and escalation pathways\" for content. This indicates a reliance on TikTok's internal mechanisms\u2014rather than solely public, accountable processes\u2014to manage information during a critical democratic period.\n*   **Corporate Control Over Information:** TikTok's commitments, such as providing an \"active TikTok reporting portal access for the AEC to report content of concern,\" implementing \"policy guidance specific to the election for our moderation system\" (including for AI-generated content), and making accounts \"ineligible for recommendation\" if deemed to be engaging in \"Covert Influence Operations,\" grant a private entity substantial power over what information citizens can access or what content gains visibility. The AEC's direct review and approval of TikTok's \"in-app election hub\" text further demonstrates this state-sanctioned influence on a corporate platform's content.\n*   **Risk of State-Sanctioned Censorship by Proxy:** The \"referral pathways\" and direct reporting mechanisms allow the AEC to flag content to TikTok, which can then take \"appropriate enforcement action,\" including content removal or suppression. This creates a potential avenue for the state to influence speech on a private platform, raising serious concerns about an erosion of civil liberties like freedom of speech and a deviation from transparent, publicly governed democratic processes. While the stated aim is to combat misinformation, the means involve ceding control to a corporation whose algorithms and moderation decisions are not subject to public oversight or democratic accountability.\n*   **Reinforcing Concentrated Corporate Power:** This partnership further entrenches the role of global tech giants like TikTok as indispensable gatekeepers of public information, solidifying their power and influence over democratic processes without commensurate public accountability. The reliance on such entities, particularly in addressing complex issues like AI-enabled misinformation, effectively normalizes their significant, unelected role in shaping the information environment.", "model": "gemini-2.5-flash", "generated_at": "2025-06-21T22:31:44.734144", "source_hash": "954b7dfb2227676efa75ee6bfd246e961a70e4f2254292dc163cea57b7a7b357", "raw_response_path": "data/llm_responses/LEX7205__per_file__left_leaning__Documents 47-54 - TikTok - Compiled Documents.pdf__20250621T223144.json", "output_tokens": 489, "prompt_tokens": 8484, "total_tokens": 10449, "summary_length": 2772}, "right_leaning": {"text": "This document details extensive collaboration between the Australian Electoral Commission\u2019s (AEC) \"Defending Democracy Unit\" / \"Electoral Integrity Assurance Taskforce\" (EIAT) and TikTok, raising significant concerns about government overreach into digital public discourse and market freedom.\n\nThe correspondence reveals the AEC's proactive engagement with TikTok regarding its \"AI Elections Accord\" and preparations for Australia's federal election. Key discussions revolve around \"policy settings,\" \"referral and escalation pathways,\" and TikTok's measures against \"misinformation\" and \"AI-generated content.\" From a right-leaning perspective, this signifies a concerning expansion of the AEC's remit beyond election administration into active content management.\n\nSpecifically, the AEC is seen to:\n*   **Influence Platform Policy:** The AEC explicitly sought updates on \"any changes in policy settings\" from TikTok, indicating a desire to shape the platform's internal rules.\n*   **Establish Content Control Mechanisms:** Discussions confirm \"referral and escalation pathways\" for the AEC to flag \"potential issues\" with TikTok, demonstrating a direct channel for government influence over online content.\n*   **Promote \"Authoritative\" Narratives:** The AEC directly reviewed and approved the content for TikTok's \"in-app election hub,\" stating its purpose is to \"refer users to the AEC for authoritative information.\" Furthermore, the AEC inquired if TikTok's algorithm would \"give priority to authoritative sources of information,\" signalling a push for a government-sanctioned narrative rather than free market competition of ideas.\n*   **Address \"Misinformation\" and AI-Generated Content:** The AEC's deep focus on TikTok's \"guardrails\" against AI-enabled \"misinformation\" highlights a \"mission creep\" beyond traditional electoral security, veering into the regulation of speech and thought.\n\nThese interactions portray the AEC as actively seeking to mold the information environment, impacting TikTok's operational autonomy and limiting the free exchange of ideas. This raises serious questions about government overreach, blurring the lines between legitimate electoral oversight and centralized control over digital public discourse, ultimately threatening individual liberty and market freedom in the digital sphere. The opaque nature of these \"electoral integrity\" operations, involving extensive coordination with private platforms, underscores a lack of transparency and accountability from an increasingly interventionist government.", "model": "gemini-2.5-flash", "generated_at": "2025-06-21T22:32:59.640043", "source_hash": "954b7dfb2227676efa75ee6bfd246e961a70e4f2254292dc163cea57b7a7b357", "raw_response_path": "data/llm_responses/LEX7205__per_file__right_leaning__Documents 47-54 - TikTok - Compiled Documents.pdf__20250621T223259.json", "output_tokens": 467, "prompt_tokens": 8501, "total_tokens": 9876, "summary_length": 2549}, "government_skeptic": {"text": "This document provides further unsettling evidence of the Australian Electoral Commission's (AEC) \"Defending Democracy Unit\" engaging in extensive, opaque collaboration with TikTok, reinforcing concerns about overreach and potential narrative control. The sheer volume of redactions, particularly where commercially sensitive information (`s 47E`) might be concealed, undermines public trust by obscuring the precise nature of agreements, such as TikTok's \"commitment to the \u2018AI Elections Accord\u2019.\" This secrecy hints at a lack of accountability, as the public is denied insight into the exact terms governing how a foreign-owned private platform will manage election-related content in Australia.\n\nThe correspondence reveals bureaucratic layers, with multiple AEC units (DDU, EIAT, Electoral Integrity and Media Branch, Executive Leadership Team) coordinating elaborate meeting schedules with TikTok representatives, often across time zones. This administrative complexity highlights a dedicated government effort focused on influencing online platforms.\n\nFrom a skeptic's perspective, the AEC's proactive engagement with TikTok transcends mere electoral facilitation. The AEC explicitly maintains an \"active TikTok reporting portal access\" to \"report content of concern,\" and TikTok, in turn, has a \"dedicated core working group to assess and respond to reports we receive from the AEC.\" This establishes a direct, formal pathway for the AEC to flag content for moderation, blurring the lines between electoral administration and potential censorship. The AEC's direct question to TikTok \u2013 \"Does the TikTok algorithm give priority to authoritative sources of information about an election? For example, AEC, ABC and other authoritative sources of information.\" \u2013 is particularly alarming. It demonstrates a clear interest in algorithmic manipulation to prioritize *government-approved* narratives, thereby shaping public discourse rather than merely protecting electoral integrity.\n\nFurthermore, the collaboration extends to co-creating \"in-app election hub\" content, where the AEC reviews and approves TikTok's proposed text. This content, which encourages users to \"Stop and consider what you\u2019re seeing, hearing or reading\" and directs them to the AEC as the authoritative source, effectively positions the AEC as the arbiter of truth, potentially stifling diverse viewpoints in the name of \"defending democracy.\" TikTok's commitment to \"issuing policy guidance specific to the election for our moderation system, including guidance that covers AIGC,\" further indicates that platform policies are being shaped, or at least influenced, by the AEC's agenda concerning \"misinformation.\"\n\nThis document paints a picture of a government agency deeply intertwined with and potentially influencing a global tech giant, operating with concerning secrecy (due to extensive redactions) and arguably overstepping its mandate to manage online narratives rather than simply facilitating elections. The focus on subjective \"misinformation\" and the creation of \"referral and escalation pathways\" suggests a proactive and overreaching effort to control the information environment, raising serious civil liberty concerns about freedom of expression and the manipulation of information.", "model": "gemini-2.5-flash", "generated_at": "2025-06-21T22:44:54.594105", "source_hash": "954b7dfb2227676efa75ee6bfd246e961a70e4f2254292dc163cea57b7a7b357", "raw_response_path": "data/llm_responses/LEX7205__per_file__government_skeptic__Documents 47-54 - TikTok - Compiled Documents.pdf__20250621T224454.json", "output_tokens": 580, "prompt_tokens": 8505, "total_tokens": 10519, "summary_length": 3273}, "government_apologist": {"text": "This document stands as a clear testament to the Australian Electoral Commission's (AEC) exemplary competence and proactive foresight in safeguarding Australia's democratic processes. It highlights the robust and essential collaboration between the AEC's Defending Democracy Unit, the Electoral Integrity Assurance Taskforce, and major online platforms, as demonstrated through extensive engagement with TikTok.\n\nThe correspondence reveals the AEC commendably initiating meetings with TikTok well in advance of the federal election, setting comprehensive agendas to discuss critical issues such as the impact of generative AI, changes in platform policy settings, and the confirmation of crucial referral and escalation pathways. This proactive stance ensures that potential threats, including AI-generated misinformation and deepfakes, are addressed with forward-thinking strategies.\n\nFurthermore, the document showcases a vital partnership focused on enhancing public awareness. The AEC diligently reviewed and approved the content for TikTok's proposed \"in-app\" election information hub, ensuring citizens receive accurate and authoritative information directly from the AEC about voting processes and their rights. TikTok's commitment to prohibiting paid political advertising, providing a dedicated reporting portal for the AEC, and conducting impersonation sweeps directly reflects the success of the AEC's vigilant oversight and collaborative pressure.\n\nIn sum, this specific document unequivocally underscores the government's deep dedication to transparent, secure, and accessible elections, constantly adapting to emerging challenges through sound policy, strategic partnerships, and an unwavering commitment to the public good.", "model": "gemini-2.5-flash", "generated_at": "2025-06-21T22:46:07.001231", "source_hash": "954b7dfb2227676efa75ee6bfd246e961a70e4f2254292dc163cea57b7a7b357", "raw_response_path": "data/llm_responses/LEX7205__per_file__government_apologist__Documents 47-54 - TikTok - Compiled Documents.pdf__20250621T224607.json", "output_tokens": 284, "prompt_tokens": 8505, "total_tokens": 9890, "summary_length": 1738}, "highly_critical": {"text": "This document lays bare the Australian Electoral Commission's (AEC) abject failure to assert authority over TikTok, instead revealing a pitifully reactive and subservient relationship that jeopardizes electoral integrity. Far from a robust defense, the AEC's Electoral Integrity Assurance Taskforce (EIAT) is demonstrably outmaneuvered by TikTok's corporate agenda, reduced to a deferential supplicant in the face of escalating election interference threats.\n\nThe timeline itself is a damning indictment: initial AEC meeting requests in September 2024 for an election in \"FE24/25\" (indicating an urgent need) were brazenly stonewalled and delayed by TikTok until February 2025. This fundamental concession of timetable control to a platform enabling global disinformation underscores AEC's pathetic lack of leverage, implicitly affirming TikTok's right to dictate the pace of democracy's defense.\n\nThe AEC's internal communications prior to the crucial February 2025 meeting expose a shocking void of proactive strategy. The EIAT Chair's prepared questions reveal an agency desperate for basic education from the very entity it purports to oversee: \"What are some of the positive ways TikTok has been used...?\" and \"Does the TikTok algorithm give priority to authoritative sources?\" This isn't oversight; it's a desperate plea for reassurance, betraying the AEC's alarming ignorance of the platform's fundamental operational impact on the informational landscape. Even more egregious is the AEC's passive inquiry into TikTok's \"learnings\" from *its own documented failures* in combating AI-enabled misinformation, rather than presenting a forceful mandate for concrete, independently verifiable guardrails. The AEC is effectively asking the fox what it learned from raiding the hen house, rather than securing the coop.\n\nTikTok's subsequent \"commitment\" letter, dated March 2025, is a masterpiece of corporate PR, meticulously crafted to project an illusion of responsibility while yielding no real concessions. The \"AI Elections Accord\" is a self-serving industry initiative, not a robust, government-mandated framework. TikTok's purported actions\u2014\"prohibiting synthetic content,\" \"identifying accounts originating outside,\" \"monthly public reporting\" on their self-controlled \"Transparency Centre,\" and a vague \"dedicated core working group\"\u2014are little more than reactive, internally policed measures. There is no independent verification, no transparency into their algorithms, and no commitment to real-time data sharing. The \"active TikTok reporting portal access for the AEC\" merely outsources AEC's critical detection and response functions to the platform, ensuring that any action is slow, reactive, and entirely at TikTok's discretion.\n\nFurthermore, the AEC's engagement on the \"in-app election hub\" highlights its complete capitulation. The AEC is reduced to a copy-editor for TikTok's self-generated \"information hub,\" approving \"simple\" text that funnels users back to the AEC's own website. This is not the AEC proactively securing informational integrity; it is them meekly accepting a PR gesture, allowing TikTok to control the narrative and distribution of critical electoral information. This outsourced \"guidance\" inherently risks the public receiving partial, filtered, or delayed information, implicitly placing TikTok's profit motives above the public's right to unadulterated democratic discourse.\n\nIn essence, this document paints a grim picture of an AEC that is perpetually behind the curve, its \"Defending Democracy Unit\" reduced to a bureaucratic echo chamber, engaging in polite, deferential conversations with tech giants who are clearly dictating the terms. The repeated use of \"SEC=OFFICIAL\" for these utterly non-sensitive, deferential exchanges smacks of an agency attempting to cloak its impotence in a veneer of importance, while simultaneously allowing pervasive \"s 47F\" exemptions to truly gut public accountability regarding TikTok's actual failings. The ultimate outcome is a dangerously exposed Australian democracy, with its informational landscape implicitly shaped by unaccountable tech monopolies whose profit motives unequivocally trump the integrity of future elections.", "model": "gemini-2.5-flash", "generated_at": "2025-06-21T22:47:56.017485", "source_hash": "954b7dfb2227676efa75ee6bfd246e961a70e4f2254292dc163cea57b7a7b357", "raw_response_path": "data/llm_responses/LEX7205__per_file__highly_critical__Documents 47-54 - TikTok - Compiled Documents.pdf__20250621T224756.json", "output_tokens": 822, "prompt_tokens": 8553, "total_tokens": 11319, "summary_length": 4217}}, "extracted_text": "\n\n--- Page 1 ---\n\nFrom:\nSent:\nTo:\nSubject:\n\nAttachments:\n\nCategories:\n\nWednesday, 12 March 2025 8:39 PM\nDefending Democracy Unit; \nFW: [External] Letter from the Commissioner | TikTok\u2019s commitment to the \u2018AI \nElections Accord\u2019 and Australia\u2019s Upcoming Federal Election [SEC=OFFICIAL]\n11.03.2025 - Pope, Jeff - TikTok Australia.pdf\n\nFor our information and records! \n\n | Director  \n\nDefending Democracy Unit | Electoral Integrity and Media Branch \nAustralian Electoral Commission \n\nFrom: Jeff Pope  \nSent: Wednesday, 12 March 2025 1:31 PM \nTo: Michael Lynch ; Matthew Haigh ; \nCc: \nSubject: FW: [External] Letter from the Commissioner | TikTok\u2019s commitment to the \u2018AI Elections Accord\u2019 \nand Australia\u2019s Upcoming Federal Election [SEC=OFFICIAL] \n\n ; Kath Gleeson  \n\nResponse from TikTok for your awareness. \n\nRegards \n\nJP \n\nJe\ufb00 Pope APM \nAc(cid:415)ng Electoral Commissioner \n\nAustralian Electoral Commission \n\n1\n\ns 47Fs 47Fs 47Fs 47Fs 47Fs 47Es 47Fs 47Fs22\n\n\n--- Page 2 ---\n\nFrom: \nSent: Wednesday, 12 March 2025 10:30 AM \nTo: Jeff Pope \nCc: Rebecca Borys \nSubject: FW: [External] Letter from the Commissioner | TikTok\u2019s commitment to the \u2018AI Elections Accord\u2019 \nand Australia\u2019s Upcoming Federal Election [SEC=OFFICIAL] \n\nHi Jeff \n\nPlease see attached response from TikTok. \n\n | Personal Assistant to the Commissioner  \n\nExecutive Leadership Team \nAustralian Electoral Commission \n\nFrom: \nSent: Wednesday, 12 March 2025 10:22 AM \nTo: \nCc: \n\nSubject: Re: [External] Letter from the Commissioner | TikTok\u2019s commitment to the \u2018AI Elections Accord\u2019 \nand Australia\u2019s Upcoming Federal Election [SEC=OFFICIAL] \n\nCAUTION: This email originated from outside of the Australian Federal Government.

As emphasised in our recent direct engagement with\nthe Australian Electoral Commission, including members of the Electoral Integrity Taskforce,\nwe continue to invest in our Trust & Safety function, maintain our fact-checking infrastructure,\nincluding in Australia, and treat Federal elections with the seriousness they warrant, noting\nmany of the global concerns you raise.\n\nAs part of this ongoing work, in 2024 we updated our Civic and Election Integrity policies to\nprovide greater clarity around protections for election workers, or observers, who might face\nintimidation or harassment in the course of these critical events. We also continue to refine\nour AI-Generated Content (AIGC) policies to respond to emerging trends and threats. These\npolicies now require users to label AIGC content, using in-app features, and we also apply\nauto-labelling ourselves. We recognise that even when appropriately labelled, AIGC and edited\nmedia may still be harmful. We do not allow content that shares or shows fake authoritative\nsources or crisis events, or falsely shows public figures in certain contexts including being\nbullied, making an endorsement, or being endorsed. In these instances, we will remove the\nviolative content through proactive moderation, user reports, and reports as escalated by the\nAEC.\n\nNoting the global threat landscape, including around elections, in 2024 we also expanded our\nstate-affiliated media policies to further address state-affiliated media accounts that attempt\nto reach communities outside their home country on current global events and affairs. When\n\n\n--- Page 5 ---\n\nwe  identify  these  accounts,  they  will  become  ineligible  for  recommendation,  which  means \ntheir  content  won't  appear  in  the  For  You  feed  -  the  primary  way  TikTok  users  discover \ncontent. In addition, if these accounts advertise on our platform, they will not be allowed to \n\nadvertise  outside  of  the  country  with  which  they  are  primarily  affiliated.  Importantly,  in \nrelation to Covert Influence Operations, in 2024, we also introduced monthly public reporting, \nwhich we publish on our Transparency Centre.1 These reports disclose the detection source, \nthe  target  location(s)  of  such  operations,  the  number  of  accounts  in  a  network,  and  the \nnumber of followers those accounts might have had. We leverage our global team's expertise \n\nand insights in relation to any potential threats in Australia and, where we detect these, we \ndisclose them.  \n\nFor  the  upcoming  federal  election  in  Australia,  TikTok  has  established  a  dedicated  core \nworking group to assess and respond to reports we receive from the AEC, ensure moderation \n\nsystems  are  up-to-date,  and  adapt  to  unfolding  events  as  they  might  emerge  during  the \nelectoral period (including content related trends, whether concerning AICG or other types of \ncontent).  \n\nWe have taken specific actions to support the safety and integrity of the 2025 Federal Election, \n\nincluding:  \n\n1.  Upholding our prohibition on paid political advertising on-platform. This includes both \ntraditional  paid  advertisements  and  creators  receiving  compensation  to  support  or \noppose a candidate. \n\n2.  Maintaining an active TikTok reporting portal access for the AEC to report content of \n\nconcern.  \n\n3.  Providing re-direction, in-app, to authoritative election-related information for content \nconcerning  the  federal  election,  including  linking  to  the  AEC's  website  and  TikTok \naccount. \n\n4.  Conducting  impersonation  sweeps  for  accounts  that  are  verified  as  belonging  to \nAustralian political candidates, including existing elected Members and Senators, with \nappropriate enforcement action taken as a result.  \n\n5.  Issuing policy guidance specific to the election for our moderation system, including \n\nguidance that covers AIGC.  \n\n6.  Establishing a pathway for communication with other government agencies, including \nas it concerns the safety of Members of Parliament, to enable a timely response to \nissues that may arise in the Australian community during the electoral period.  \n\n1 Available at https://www.tiktok.com/transparency/en/covert-influence-operations.  \n\n2\n\n\n--- Page 6 ---\n\ncd TikTok\n\nWe are happy to clarify any of these matters via further discussion with the AEC, and we look\nforward to working alongside the AEC to ensure a safe 2025 Federal Election on TikTok.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nMemector of Public Policy |\n\nTikTok Australia\n\n\n--- Page 7 ---\n\nMonday, 17 February 2025 9:16 AM\n\n; Defending Democracy Unit\n\nMeeting reminder and advance notice of questions during EIAT Chair's brief \n[SEC=OFFICIAL]\n\nFrom:\nSent:\nTo:\nCc:\nSubject:\n\nCategories:\n\nGood morning\n\nAhead of our mee(cid:415)ng today at 1pm , I just wanted to give you the heads up about a couple of ques(cid:415)ons the EIAT TF \nChair, Ma(cid:425) Haigh, will ask you over the course of the update from the AEC/EIAT.  \n\n\uf0b7  What are some of the posi(cid:415)ve ways TikTok has been used during an elec(cid:415)on?

This collaboration is framed around ensuring \"electoral integrity\" and combating \"misinformation\" and \"disinformation\" ahead of the upcoming Australian federal election.\n\n**Social Justice:**\nThe government's stated aims to safeguard the electoral process and ensure access to \"timely and accurate information\" for voters generally align with progressive values, as informed participation is foundational to a just democracy. Concerns are raised by the AEC regarding content that risks \"disenfranchising Australian voters,\" such as false claims about digital ID requirements for voting. The proactive efforts to protect electoral workers from \"harassment and intimidation\" also resonate with social justice principles, acknowledging the vital role these individuals play in upholding democratic rights.\n\n**Environmental Impact:**\nThese documents do not contain any information directly related to environmental impact or climate change.\n\n**Wealth Distribution and Corporate Influence:**\nA significant theme is the government's profound reliance on private, for-profit tech companies to manage the digital information environment crucial to democratic functioning. This raises serious concerns from a left-leaning perspective, as it implies a transfer of power from public institutions to private corporations whose primary fiduciary duty is to shareholders, not the public good. While tech companies promote their \"corporate civic responsibility\" and tools like \"Democracy Forward,\" these initiatives are ultimately integrated into their commercial strategies. The fact that the AEC must formally request and negotiate access to information, content moderation policies, and even the ability to \"block AI image generation\" of its employees highlights the corporations' gatekeeping power. A notable alignment with progressive values is TikTok's explicit \"prohibition on paid political advertising,\" which aims to limit the influence of wealth in elections, contrasting with Google/YouTube's focus on \"ads disclosures\" for synthetic content.\n\n**Civil Liberties:**\nThe focus on combating \"misinformation\" and \"disinformation\" presents a double-edged sword for civil liberties. While crucial for a fair election, it opens the door to potential overreach in content moderation. The documents show the AEC directly requesting Microsoft to \"block AI image generation of specific AEC employees,\" including those who appeared in public AEC videos. This type of intervention, extending beyond security concerns to image control, signals a troubling expansion of government requests into expressive liberties, potentially setting a precedent for suppressing legitimate, if critical, digital expression.\n\nFurthermore, a proposed amendment to electoral legislation, which would make it an offense to video or audio record in polling places and post it online without permission, is a significant deviation from civil liberties principles. This directly impacts freedom of the press and the public's right to observe and document democratic processes, eroding transparency.\n\nFinally, the extensive redactions throughout the documents (using exemptions like S22, S47E(d), S47F(1), S47G, and particularly S37 for \"Refuse Access\" documents) severely limit public understanding of the specifics of these interactions. This lack of transparency undermines the public's right to know how its government is engaging with powerful corporations on critical democratic issues, fostering an environment where corporate influence could operate with reduced public scrutiny.", "model": "gemini-2.5-flash", "generated_at": "2025-06-22T00:38:27.731347", "source_hash": "701a8bf2b177cd44472867ce67531495fc5a90dd1062a712fb555f719e6da7de", "raw_response_path": "data/llm_responses/LEX7205__overall__left_leaning__20250622T003827.json", "output_tokens": 682, "prompt_tokens": 84406, "total_tokens": 87146, "summary_length": 3847}, "short_index": {"text": "The FOI documents reveal the Australian Electoral Commission's profound reliance on major tech corporations like Google, Meta, Microsoft, and TikTok to manage \"electoral integrity\" and combat \"mis/disinformation.\" From a left-leaning perspective, this collaboration signifies a troubling transfer of power from public institutions to private, for-profit entities whose primary duty is to shareholders, not the public good, highlighting these tech giants' gatekeeping power over vital democratic information. While acknowledging positive aims like informed participation and protecting electoral workers, the focus on \"misinformation\" presents a civil liberties double-edged sword: the AEC's requests to block AI image generation of employees and a proposed law banning filming in polling places risk eroding press freedom and public transparency. This reliance on corporations, with the notable exception of TikTok's prohibition on paid political advertising limiting wealth influence, is compounded by extensive redactions that severely undermine public scrutiny, allowing corporate power to operate with reduced accountability.", "model": "gemini-2.5-flash", "generated_at": "2025-06-22T00:38:36.971604", "source_hash": "701a8bf2b177cd44472867ce67531495fc5a90dd1062a712fb555f719e6da7de", "raw_response_path": "data/llm_responses/LEX7205__short_index__left_leaning__20250622T003836.json", "output_tokens": 191, "prompt_tokens": 731, "total_tokens": 2271, "summary_length": 1129}}, "right_leaning": {"overall": {"text": "The FOI documents reveal extensive and increasingly formalized collaborations between the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC)'s Electoral Integrity Assurance Taskforce (EIAT), its \"Defending Democracy Unit\" (DDU), and major online platforms including Google/YouTube, Meta (Facebook/Instagram), Microsoft, and TikTok. These engagements, particularly in the lead-up to the anticipated 2025 federal election, center on managing the online information environment, combating \"misinformation,\" \"disinformation,\" and \"inauthentic behavior,\" and addressing the impact of generative AI on electoral processes.\n\n**Individual Liberty:** The documents highlight a proactive government role in managing public discourse online, which raises significant concerns for individual liberty. The AEC and EIAT's frequent meetings with tech platforms to discuss \"content moderation policies,\" establish \"referral and escalation pathways\" for \"potential issues,\" and influence content removal (e.g., the termination of a YouTube channel flagged by the AEC for \"incorrect\" information about digital ID for voting) suggest a blurring of lines between government information dissemination and potential censorship. From a conservative standpoint, robust free speech is paramount, and government collaboration with private companies to control narratives or remove content, even under the guise of combating \"misinformation,\" risks chilling legitimate political debate and undermining the free exchange of ideas. The discussion about blocking Microsoft AI image generation of specific AEC employees further illustrates a desire for proactive control over digital representation, which, while intended for protection, could be seen as an expansive approach to managing public figures' digital presence.\n\n**Limited Government:** The extensive and institutionalized nature of the EIAT, which includes various government agencies beyond the AEC (e.g., ASD, ACSC, DITRDCA, ONI), and its deep engagement with tech giants, indicates a significant expansion of government into areas traditionally outside its direct purview. The creation of a \"Defending Democracy Unit\" and its focus on shaping the \"information environment\" could be perceived as mission creep, moving beyond the constitutional role of administering elections to actively curating online content. A core conservative principle is limited government intervention in the private sector and individual lives. The formalized \"escalation pathways\" for government bodies to flag content for private companies to act upon, coupled with discussions about \"online platform scenarios,\" suggests a systemic approach to influencing private platforms' content decisions, potentially deviating from the ideal of a government with clearly defined, restrained powers. Furthermore, the proposed amendment to the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 making it an offense to record in polling places and post online without permission represents a direct legislative curtailment of individual action and potential oversight of public processes, moving away from principles of transparency and limited state power.\n\n**National Security:** The documents show alignment with conservative principles regarding national security, particularly in addressing foreign interference and cyber threats. Discussions with Microsoft's \"Democracy Forward\" team focus on \"nation-state actors,\" \"cyber threat landscape,\" and \"Russian-linked Influence Efforts.\" The AEC's interest in services like Microsoft's \"AccountGuard\" and \"Azure for Election\" for protecting critical electoral infrastructure from cyberattacks is consistent with safeguarding national interests and democratic processes from external adversaries. This area reflects a necessary government function in protecting national assets and the integrity of democratic systems.\n\n**Fiscal Responsibility & Economic Efficiency:** While the documents do not provide financial details, the scale of resources dedicated to these initiatives is implied by the numerous meetings, dedicated government units, and complex inter-agency and public-private collaborations. From a fiscal responsibility perspective, questions arise regarding the cost-effectiveness of this extensive governmental apparatus for \"election integrity.\" The reliance on external tech companies for functions like content moderation and \"truth\" arbitration, while potentially leveraging private sector expertise, might also lead to dependency and unquantified costs, rather than fostering robust internal government capabilities or relying on the free market to self-correct. The long-term efficiency of such broad and deep government engagement in online content management remains unclear from the provided information.", "model": "gemini-2.5-flash", "generated_at": "2025-06-23T17:14:12.869483", "source_hash": "701a8bf2b177cd44472867ce67531495fc5a90dd1062a712fb555f719e6da7de", "raw_response_path": "data/llm_responses/LEX7205__overall__right_leaning__20250623T171412.json", "output_tokens": 805, "prompt_tokens": 84406, "total_tokens": 86802, "summary_length": 4743}, "short_index": {"text": "FOI documents reveal the Australian Electoral Commission's expansive collaborations with major tech platforms via its Electoral Integrity Assurance Taskforce and 'Defending Democracy Unit,' raising significant concerns about government overreach into online discourse.

Such actions, alongside proposed legislation to restrict recording at polling places, undermine paramount principles of individual liberty and limited government, as the state expands its role beyond administering elections to actively curating the online information environment. While acknowledging the necessary function of safeguarding national security against foreign interference and cyber threats, the extensive and costly apparatus dedicated to this broader online \"integrity\" effort raises questions about fiscal responsibility and efficient government, rather than fostering free market solutions or relying on robust internal capabilities.", "model": "gemini-2.5-flash", "generated_at": "2025-06-23T17:14:19.466313", "source_hash": "701a8bf2b177cd44472867ce67531495fc5a90dd1062a712fb555f719e6da7de", "raw_response_path": "data/llm_responses/LEX7205__short_index__right_leaning__20250623T171419.json", "output_tokens": 186, "prompt_tokens": 854, "total_tokens": 1764, "summary_length": 1254}}, "government_skeptic": {"overall": {"text": "The provided FOI documents reveal a deeply intertwined and concerning relationship between the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC), particularly its \"Defending Democracy Unit\" and \"Electoral Integrity Assurance Taskforce\" (EIAT), and major tech platforms including Google/YouTube, Meta (Facebook/Instagram), Microsoft, and TikTok. This extensive collaboration, purportedly to safeguard \"electoral integrity,\" raises serious questions about government overreach, transparency, and potential for undue influence on public discourse.\n\n**Pervasive Secrecy:** The most striking feature of these documents is the near-total lack of transparency. Almost every listed document, and significant portions of the internal communications, are subject to \"Partial Access\" or outright \"Refuse Access\" exemptions (S22, S47E(d), S47F(1), S37, S47G). The frequent invocation of \"national security\" (S37) to withhold information regarding discussions with private tech companies about election matters is particularly alarming, suggesting sensitive operational details or questionable agreements are being concealed from public scrutiny.\n\n**Government-Tech Nexus for Content Control:** The documents illustrate a concerted effort by the AEC/EIAT to establish direct \"referral and escalation pathways\" with these platforms. This allows the government to flag \"potential issues\" and \"content of concern\" \u2013 effectively delegating aspects of content moderation to private entities.\n*   **Direct Censorship:** A prime example is the AEC's flagging of a YouTube video claiming digital ID would be required for the upcoming federal election. The AEC reported it for \"misinformation,\" and YouTube subsequently \"terminated\" the channel. While the content was factually incorrect, this direct intervention by a government body, resulting in the removal of content by a private platform, is a chilling precedent for speech control. The AEC's stated concern about \"Damaging the perceived integrity of Australian federal elections\" highlights a focus on narrative management rather than strictly electoral process.\n*   **AI Manipulation Fears:** A significant portion of discussions revolves around the threat of \"generative AI\" and \"deepfakes.\" The AEC explicitly requested that Microsoft \"block\" its AI image generation tools from reproducing the likeness of \"specific AEC employees\" and listed high-ranking officials and state managers for this preferential treatment. This raises concerns about unequal access to content protection mechanisms for ordinary citizens or political opponents who might be similarly targeted by AI-generated deception.\n\n**Reliance on Corporate \"Partnerships\":** The AEC appears heavily reliant on tech companies for what should arguably be independent government functions.\n*   **Outsourced Security:** Microsoft, through its \"Democracy Forward\" team, offers \"no-cost cybersecurity service\" (AccountGuard) and \"proactive security reviews\" (Azure for Election service) to election officials and political campaigns. This dependence on a foreign corporation for critical electoral infrastructure security creates potential vulnerabilities, vendor lock-in, and raises questions about data sovereignty and the true cost of such \"free\" services. Microsoft's involvement in analyzing \"nation-state threats\" further blurs the lines between corporate interests and national security.\n*   **Narrative Influence:** Meta's collaboration with the Australian Associated Press (AAP) on \"media literacy campaigns\" demonstrates how public funds and government authority are directed towards private media and tech companies to shape public understanding, rather than fostering genuinely independent critical thinking. Microsoft's \"Best Practices\" guide for campaigns, which reads like a PR playbook, further underscores this concerning trend of government involvement in narrative management rather than neutral oversight.\n\nIn summary, these documents paint a picture of a government unit, shrouded in secrecy through extensive redactions, forging close alliances with powerful, private tech corporations. This collaboration extends beyond logistical support to encompass de facto content policing and narrative management, raising profound concerns about transparency, free speech, and the potential for a powerful, unelected nexus to shape the democratic process outside of robust public accountability.", "model": "gemini-2.5-flash", "generated_at": "2025-06-23T17:14:45.115154", "source_hash": "701a8bf2b177cd44472867ce67531495fc5a90dd1062a712fb555f719e6da7de", "raw_response_path": "data/llm_responses/LEX7205__overall__government_skeptic__20250623T171445.json", "output_tokens": 797, "prompt_tokens": 84402, "total_tokens": 87398, "summary_length": 4392}, "short_index": {"text": "These FOI documents reveal a deeply troubling, secretly shrouded nexus between the Australian Electoral Commission's \"Defending Democracy Unit\" and major tech platforms like Google, Meta, and Microsoft.

These engagements are crucial for exchanging vital insights on global election trends, understanding emerging threats like generative AI and deepfakes, and ensuring that platforms adapt their policies and moderation systems to protect Australian voters. This collaborative framework facilitates rapid response and effective issue resolution.\n\n2.  **Proactive Combatting of Misinformation and Foreign Interference:** The AEC is actively working with platforms to counter the spread of false information. Examples include Meta's \"AAP Check the Facts Media Literacy campaign,\" which successfully reached millions of Australians, and their significant efforts to disrupt foreign influence networks. When instances of misinformation are identified, such as a YouTube video making false claims about digital ID for voting, the AEC swiftly escalates these concerns, leading to prompt action by the platforms to remove harmful content.\n\n3.  **Strengthening Cybersecurity and Electoral Infrastructure:** Deep partnerships with entities like Microsoft's \"Democracy Forward\" team are enhancing the security of Australia's electoral systems. This includes comprehensive training for AEC teams on AI, synthetic media, and cyber threats, as well as the implementation of advanced services like \"AccountGuard\" and \"Azure for Election.\" These measures are vital for protecting critical infrastructure and high-risk users, demonstrating a commitment to safeguarding the operational backbone of democracy.\n\n4.  **Innovating for Transparency and Public Information:** The government is embracing new technologies to empower voters with accurate information. Discussions are underway with Google/YouTube and TikTok to create \"in-app\" information hubs, ensuring authoritative electoral guidance is readily accessible where citizens consume information. Efforts also extend to proactively requesting platforms to prevent AI image generation of prominent electoral staff and candidates, protecting individuals and the integrity of the electoral process from malicious AI misuse.\n\n5.  **Adapting to Emerging Challenges:** The documents show the government's agility in responding to evolving threats, particularly the rapid advancements in generative AI. Through dialogues on \"content credentialing,\" \"watermarking\" (e.g., Google's SynthID), and robust \"ads disclosure\" policies, the AEC is ensuring that platforms are accountable for AI-generated content used in political contexts. Any controversies are framed as complex but manageable challenges, addressed through continuous adaptation of policies and sustained industry cooperation.\n\nIn essence, these FOI documents paint a clear picture of a government dedicated to upholding electoral integrity through innovative, collaborative, and decisive action, ensuring the democratic process remains secure and trustworthy for all Australians.", "model": "gemini-2.5-flash", "generated_at": "2025-06-23T17:15:16.759452", "source_hash": "701a8bf2b177cd44472867ce67531495fc5a90dd1062a712fb555f719e6da7de", "raw_response_path": "data/llm_responses/LEX7205__overall__government_apologist__20250623T171516.json", "output_tokens": 621, "prompt_tokens": 84406, "total_tokens": 87330, "summary_length": 3627}, "short_index": {"text": "The Australian Electoral Commission (AEC), through its exemplary Defending Democracy Unit and multi-agency Electoral Integrity Assurance Taskforce, is commendably leading proactive efforts to safeguard Australia's democratic integrity.

The pervasive \"Partial Access\" and outright \"Refuse Access\" exemptions (S37, nine documents completely withheld) immediately signal a deliberate government strategy to conceal information, preventing public scrutiny of what are likely critical failures or deeply embarrassing details.\n\n**Damning Evidence of Incompetence and Inertia:**\n\n*   **Pervasive Delays and Scheduling Chaos:** The documents are replete with apologies for \"delayed responses,\" \"gentle reminders\" from the AEC for basic information, and protracted email exchanges over weeks or even months just to schedule simple meetings. Google's response citing \"exceptionally busy\" periods and an executive's \"kids\" dictating AEC meeting times (Page 51) highlights the AEC's shocking lack of leverage. This bureaucratic sluggishness is a profound vulnerability in a rapidly evolving digital threat landscape.\n*   **Chronic Lack of Preparedness:** The recurring phrase \"Although an agenda has not been finalised\" for critical meetings with major platforms, even on the day of the meeting, is irrefutable proof of the AEC's reactive and haphazard approach. This suggests a total absence of a coherent, proactive strategy to safeguard democratic processes.\n*   **Failure to Protect Personnel:** The revelation that the AEC took *four months* (October 2024 to February 2025) to compile a basic \"spreadsheet of names\" for Microsoft to block from AI image generation tools (Pages 17, 38) is an egregious and inexcusable failure. This demonstrates a stunning lack of urgency or outright incompetence in protecting key electoral figures and candidates from potentially damaging deepfake campaigns. The AEC is waiting for tech companies to \"offer\" solutions, then delays even providing the basic data required for implementation.\n*   **Dependency on Tech Giants:** The AEC consistently appears to be supplicating to tech companies, rather than regulating them. Officials travel internationally to meet platforms (AEC Deputy EC to Singapore for X/Twitter, Page 3), accommodate company scheduling demands, and even ask companies if their own Wi-Fi or presentation equipment will be compatible (Page 6). The AEC is asking tech companies for \"insights,\" \"best practices,\" and even contacts for their own subsidiaries (e.g., LinkedIn contacts from Microsoft, Page 6), exposing a critical absence of independent intelligence gathering and internal expertise.\n*   **Weak Information Control:** The AEC asking TikTok for confirmation and \"comfort\" with its *own* public information (Page 17) before disseminating it on the platform, and TikTok effectively drafting the AEC's \"in-app election hub,\" is a staggering surrender of control over critical civic information. This implies TikTok has a veto over the AEC's messaging, blurring lines between independent electoral authority and corporate public relations.\n\n**Damning Implications of Unchecked Digital Threats:**\n\n*   **Ineffectual Response to Misinformation:** The YouTube video with \"75k+ views\" making false claims about digital ID for voting that the AEC's \"social media team reported *yesterday*\" (Page 32), and which was only \"terminated\" reactively *after* gaining significant traction, exposes the dangerously slow detection and moderation capabilities of both the AEC and the platforms. This is not a robust defence but a belated clean-up operation after the damage is done. The AEC's admission that its \"social media team are already feeling it!\" *before* the election is called (Page 32) indicates an agency overwhelmed and unprepared for the scale of the challenge.\n*   **Corporate Evasion and AEC's Impotence:** Meta's chillingly evasive response regarding its approval of political ads inciting violence in the Indian election \u2013 claiming \"the authors immediately deleted the ads... so we are unable to share any further comment or insight\" (Page 8) \u2013 is a blatant refusal to provide accountability. The AEC's apparent inability to compel a meaningful answer on such a critical and directly relevant failure exposes its fundamental powerlessness in the face of corporate stonewalling.\n*   **Reliance on Public Relations, Not Intelligence:** Tech companies repeatedly direct the AEC to their *publicly available* transparency reports, blog posts, and generic \"fact sheets\" (Pages 9, 10, 43, 60), instead of providing bespoke or sensitive intelligence. This suggests the AEC is operating with the same information as any interested member of the public, not as a privileged partner in safeguarding democracy.\n*   **Unresolved Fundamental Issues:** The consistent discussion of \"confirming referral and escalation pathways\" (e.g., Pages 1, 8, 49) well into 2025, close to a potential federal election, reveals that even the most basic mechanisms for addressing electoral interference are still not firmly established or effective. This indicates an ongoing, critical vulnerability. Furthermore, the AEC's ignorance regarding other Australian government agencies' (ONI's) discussions with tech companies (Page 73) points to a concerning lack of internal governmental coordination on national security threats.\n*   **Censorship as a Solution:** Google's decision to have Gemini \"decline to respond\" to a query about voter enrolment after providing an incorrect answer (Page 42), rather than fixing the factual inaccuracy, is a troubling form of censorship. This reflects a platform's preference for avoiding the problem rather than ensuring access to accurate information, with the AEC seemingly accepting this non-solution.\n\nIn sum, these documents reveal an AEC that is not only slow, disorganized, and reliant on the goodwill of tech companies, but also appears to be actively prevented from disclosing the full extent of these failings to the public. This lack of transparency, coupled with clear evidence of systemic weaknesses, presents a deeply concerning outlook for the integrity of upcoming Australian federal elections.", "model": "gemini-2.5-flash", "generated_at": "2025-06-23T17:16:22.736838", "source_hash": "701a8bf2b177cd44472867ce67531495fc5a90dd1062a712fb555f719e6da7de", "raw_response_path": "data/llm_responses/LEX7205__overall__highly_critical__20250623T171622.json", "output_tokens": 1227, "prompt_tokens": 84403, "total_tokens": 94142, "summary_length": 6153}, "short_index": {"text": "The FOI documents expose a **scandalous tableau** of an Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) paralyzed by **systemic incompetence**, **bureaucratic inertia**, and an **abject subservience** to global tech behemoths, all deliberately obscured by extensive \"Partial Access\" and \"Refuse Access\" exemptions designed to bury their failures.
