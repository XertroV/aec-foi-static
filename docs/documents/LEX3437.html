<h4>3. Main Content from the FOI Request Documents</h4>
<p>The released documents provide content primarily related to the first part of the FOI request concerning staff adherence to professional standards and limitations on public communication. No documents were provided regarding MOUs with the Australian Federal Police.</p>
<h5>a. Measures for AEC Staff Adherence to APS Values, Employment Principles, and Code of Conduct:</h5>
<ul>
<li><strong>Formal Breach Procedures:</strong><ul>
<li><code>AEC Procedures for Determining Breaches of the APS Code of Conduct and Sanctions</code> outlines the process for investigating suspected breaches of the APS Code of Conduct, including who can determine a breach, the requirement for procedural fairness (informing the employee, opportunity to respond, independent decision-makers), and the selection of proportionate sanctions (ranging from reprimand to termination). Records of determinations and sanctions are required.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Obligation Acknowledgement at Engagement:</strong><ul>
<li>The <code>Acknowledgement and declaration of key obligations</code> form requires staff to acknowledge their commitment to political neutrality, avoiding conflicts of interest, accuracy of provided information, Work Health and Safety (WHS) compliance, and familiarity with relevant legislation (including the Public Service Act 1999) and AEC policies. It specifically references the APS Values, APS Employment Principles, and Code of Conduct as key obligations.</li>
<li>The <code>Letter of engagement as an ongoing APS employee</code> explicitly states that engagement is conditional on "Complying with the Australian Public Service (APS) Values and Code of Conduct." It reiterates the requirement for political neutrality and details several points of the APS Code of Conduct (e.g., honesty, diligence, respect, compliance with laws/directions, confidentiality, conflict of interest avoidance, proper resource use, not providing false information, upholding integrity). Failure to meet these conditions can lead to offer withdrawal or employment termination.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Induction and Training Programs:</strong><ul>
<li>The <code>APS1 Induction and training booklet</code> introduces new staff to the AEC's values (Electoral Integrity, Quality, Agility, Professionalism, "Every task matters," and "Ballot paper principles"), the APS Values (ICARE: Impartial, Committed to service, Accountable, Respectful, Ethical), and the full text of the APS Code of Conduct. It emphasizes that Code breaches can lead to sanctions up to termination. It lists mandatory eLearning courses covering WHS, Protective Security, Fraud, Privacy, IT Security, and Ballot Paper Handling, among others.</li>
<li>The <code>National Induction Program</code> documents (<code>Outline</code>, <code>Curriculum Overview</code>, <code>Roles and Responsibilities</code>, <code>Detailed curriculum and associated learning outcomes</code>) describe a structured, nationally consistent induction program for APS2-SES staff (APS1 staff are noted as outside its direct scope, but are covered by the APS1 booklet). This program aims to ensure staff behave in accordance with AEC/APS values and the Code of Conduct, promote a positive organizational culture, and comply with policies and legislation. The curriculum explicitly includes modules on APS Values and Code of Conduct, Privacy, Protective Security, Fraud, Political Neutrality, Conflict of Interest, and Public Governance. It defines the roles and responsibilities of Line Managers, Local Induction Advisers, Executive Level Officers, and Trainers in guiding new staff to meet these standards, emphasizing professional conduct and adherence to established procedures.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h5>b. Limitations, Restrictions, or Prohibitions on Telephone Communication with Members of the Public:</h5>
<ul>
<li><strong>Public Engagement Team Handbook:</strong><ul>
<li>Outlines the responsibilities of Public Enquiries Officers, including answering calls to the National Office switchboard and managing public email inquiries.</li>
<li>Details contact telephone numbers, hours of operation (9am-5pm, Mon-Fri, diverted to call centre during federal elections).</li>
<li>Provides procedures for <strong>Interpreter Calls</strong> and the <strong>National Relay Service</strong>.</li>
<li>Specifies instructions for <strong>Transferring switchboard to an internal number</strong> and back.</li>
<li>Under "Incoming calls" (Appendix A), it explicitly states:<ul>
<li>Marketing and sales calls are <em>not</em> to be transferred to staff.</li>
<li>Officers <em>may not confirm</em> whether a person works for the AEC, a person’s work number, a person’s email address, or the format of AEC email addresses.</li>
<li>For Senior Executive Staff (Assistant Commissioners and above), Public Enquiries Officers <em>do not transfer calls from members of the public</em>; instead, they take a message. For MPs, Senators, major political party executives, or other Government Agency callers, contact relevant Executive Assistants or Branch Project Officers for discussion.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Details the AEC's responsibility for recording <strong>Recorded messages for switchboard</strong> for outside business hours, public holidays, and emergencies, including specific scripts for these messages.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>APS1 Induction and Training Booklet:</strong><ul>
<li>Includes a "Public Enquiries" section with guidelines for quality client service, emphasizing a positive and helpful approach, accurate information, and timely resolution.</li>
<li>Sets "Service level standards" for public contact channels: Phone (answered within 90 seconds), Walk-in (acknowledged within 5 minutes), Email/Post (responded within 5 working days).</li>
<li>Instructs staff to resolve straightforward inquiries at the first point of contact and record them in the Public Engagement Contact Tool (PECT).</li>
<li>For more complex inquiries, or those from political parties/candidates, staff are instructed to refer them to their supervisor or the Divisional Returning Officer (DRO).</li>
<li>All complaints are to be logged in PECT, acknowledged promptly, and resolved within 10 business days.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h5>c. Memoranda of Understanding with Australian Federal Police:</h5>
<ul>
<li>No documents were provided in response to this part of the FOI request.</li>

    <div class="ai-summary-markdown-content">
      <p>As a politically left-leaning analyst, the provided FOI documents from the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) reveal a complex interplay between robust internal governance, a commitment to public service, and notable restrictions on employee civil liberties, particularly concerning political engagement.</p>
<p><strong>Alignment with Progressive Values:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Social Justice, Inclusivity, and Accessibility:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The AEC demonstrates a strong commitment to social justice through its explicit policies ensuring accessibility to electoral services. The <strong>Public Engagement Team Handbook</strong> highlights the mandatory use of interpreter services (LanguageLoop, Home Affairs’ TIS) for non-English speakers and the National Relay Service for individuals with hearing or speech impairments. This aligns directly with progressive values of equitable access and inclusive governance, ensuring all citizens, regardless of linguistic or physical barriers, can participate.</li>
<li>The <strong>Letter of Engagement</strong> and <strong>National Induction Program Curriculum</strong> detail provisions for "Reasonable Adjustment Support" for staff with disabilities, indicating an institutional commitment to workplace inclusion and fair employment practices.</li>
<li>The <strong>National Induction Program Curriculum</strong> also features dedicated modules on "Cultural Appreciation," "Working with Indigenous Australians," and "Diversity, culture and inclusion," which are strong positive indicators of the AEC's commitment to equity and representation within its workforce and operations.</li>
<li>Emphasis on treating "everyone with respect and courtesy" is consistently woven through the <strong>APS Code of Conduct</strong> (reiterated in multiple documents), reinforcing a foundation of dignity in public interactions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Privacy and Data Protection:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The documents underscore a stringent approach to privacy, particularly concerning elector information. The <strong>APS1 Induction and Training Booklet</strong> and <strong>Public Engagement Team Handbook</strong> emphasize "very strict rules about privacy and security" and explicitly prohibit unauthorized access (e.g., looking up a friend's details) or disclosure of personal data, which can constitute a criminal offence. This robust commitment to data integrity and individual privacy rights strongly aligns with progressive concerns about digital civil liberties and the misuse of personal information by government entities.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Accountability and Transparency (within limits):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>Public Engagement Team Handbook</strong> details a structured "Public Engagement Contact Tool (PECT)" for logging all public inquiries, feedback, and complaints, alongside a "Complaints Management Framework." This systematic approach to tracking public interactions and addressing grievances fosters governmental accountability and responsiveness.</li>
<li>The <strong>National Induction Program Outline</strong> explicitly lists "Recognise the importance of transparency in the AEC and its impact on reputation and public perception" as a core learning outcome, demonstrating an institutional understanding of the value of open governance.</li>
<li>The <strong>AEC Procedures for Determining Breaches of the APS Code of Conduct</strong> mandates procedural fairness for employees facing misconduct allegations, and requires independent and unbiased decision-makers, aligning with principles of fair process.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Anti-Corruption and Responsible Public Finance:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>Letter of Engagement</strong> and <strong>APS1 Induction and Training Booklet</strong> detail the <strong>APS Code of Conduct</strong> provisions requiring honesty, integrity, avoidance of conflicts of interest, and proper use of Commonwealth resources. This directly combats corporate influence and ensures public funds are managed responsibly, aligning with progressive anti-corruption stances.</li>
<li>The <strong>National Induction Program Curriculum</strong> includes training on "Procurement and contract management" and "Public Governance and Accountability," indicating a proactive approach to ensuring ethical financial practices.</li>
<li>The <strong>Public Engagement Team Handbook</strong> shows due diligence in verifying interpreter service invoices, preventing misuse of public funds. Restrictions on the sale and broad public access to the electoral roll post-2004 also align with a progressive desire to limit commercialization of public data and potential corporate exploitation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Deviation from Progressive Values:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Civil Liberties (Freedom of Political Expression for Staff):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The most significant area of deviation from broad progressive civil liberties is the exceptionally strict and broadly interpreted "political neutrality" requirement imposed on AEC staff. The <strong>Acknowledgement and declaration of key obligations</strong> and <strong>Letter of Engagement</strong> explicitly state that AEC cannot employ anyone who "publicly engages in political activities or who intends to do so, or where there is a perception that the person is involved with such activity." The <strong>APS1 Induction and Training Booklet</strong> extends this to social media, noting that "Your actions online must not conflict with the AEC’s political impartiality requirement."</li>
<li>While the necessity of perceived impartiality for an electoral body is acknowledged for maintaining public trust, this policy imposes substantial restrictions on the freedom of expression and political participation of public servants in their private lives. From a progressive perspective, such a broad prohibition, especially covering "perception," can be seen as an overreach that chills civic engagement and limits the democratic rights of individuals merely by virtue of their employment in the public service. It prioritizes institutional reputation over individual civil liberties to an extent that warrants critical examination.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Transparency (Potential for Less Scrutiny in Misconduct Cases):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A minor point of concern arises from the <strong>AEC Procedures for Determining Breaches of the APS Code of Conduct</strong>, which notes that "Not all suspected breaches of the Code may need to be dealt with by way of a determination. In particular circumstances, another way of dealing with a suspected breach of the Code may be more appropriate." While procedural fairness is maintained, if "another way" implies a less formal or less publicly transparent process, it could potentially reduce accountability for certain types of misconduct.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In summary, the AEC documents demonstrate a robust commitment to core progressive values concerning social justice, accessibility, privacy, and anti-corruption within its operational framework. However, the stringent "political neutrality" requirements, particularly impacting employees' off-duty conduct and expression, present a notable tension with broader progressive ideals of individual civil liberties and freedom of political participation.</p>

    <div class="ai-summary-markdown-content">
      <p>As a right-leaning analyst, a review of these FOI documents from the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) reveals an institution deeply focused on internal controls, efficiency, and the integrity of the electoral process, largely aligning with conservative principles, though with some notable deviations.</p>
<p><strong>Economic Efficiency:</strong><br />
The documents emphasize <strong>"efficient delivery of polling services"</strong> and the AEC's commitment to <strong>"quality, agility, and professionalism."</strong> The "Every Task Matters" principle and detailed "Ballot Paper Principles" highlight a commitment to precision and accountability, which, if executed well, contribute to overall efficiency by preventing costly errors and maintaining public trust. The structured induction and training, while extensive (up to 5 months for some staff), employs a "70:20:10 model" that prioritizes on-the-job learning (70%), a pragmatic approach that can be more efficient than purely formal training. Service level standards for public engagement (e.g., phones answered within 90 seconds, emails within 5 days) demonstrate an intent for responsiveness and efficiency in public service. Rigorous adherence to policies preventing fraud and misuse of Commonwealth resources (as outlined in Code of Conduct and PGPA Act) directly supports fiscal responsibility and efficient use of taxpayer money.</p>
<p><strong>Individual Liberty:</strong><br />
The AEC documents demonstrate a strong commitment to protecting <strong>individual privacy</strong>, particularly regarding elector information. The "Privacy Act 1988" and "Australian Privacy Principles" are repeatedly cited, with strict rules against unauthorized access or disclosure of personal data, including medical information and details of friends/colleagues. This aligns well with conservative emphasis on privacy rights and limited government intrusion into personal affairs. Employees are also afforded <strong>procedural fairness</strong> in misconduct investigations, including the right to make statements and have a support person.</p>
<p>However, a significant deviation from individual liberty principles is the <strong>mandatory COVID-19 vaccination policy</strong> as a condition of engagement. This governmental requirement for personal health decisions raises concerns about bodily autonomy and potential overreach. Additionally, the strict requirement for staff to <strong>"maintain political neutrality"</strong> and avoid "publicly engag[ing] in political activities" could be viewed as an infringement on an individual's right to free speech and political expression outside of official duties, especially if broadly interpreted to include "perception." While electoral integrity demands impartiality, the breadth of this restriction warrants scrutiny.</p>
<p><strong>National Security:</strong><br />
The overarching theme of <strong>"Electoral Integrity"</strong> is a critical component of national security. The documents repeatedly stress the importance of an "impartial and independent electoral system," the "sanctity of the ballot paper," "active electoral roll management," and the prevention of fraud. Requirements for <strong>Australian citizenship</strong> and satisfactory <strong>character clearances</strong> (national police checks) for employees directly contribute to ensuring a trustworthy workforce in a sensitive government agency. Extensive training on "Protective Security Awareness," "IT Security," and "Fraud Awareness," along with protocols for handling threats, all underscore a robust approach to safeguarding the democratic process from internal and external compromise, which is foundational to national security.</p>
<p><strong>Fiscal Responsibility:</strong><br />
The AEC exhibits a strong commitment to <strong>fiscal responsibility</strong> through its emphasis on adherence to the "Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Act 2013 (PGPA Act)," the "APS Code of Conduct," and internal "Accountable Authority Instructions." These frameworks aim to prevent the <strong>"misapplication, or improper dispos[al] of or use, public money,"</strong> and explicitly criminalize theft, fraud, and bribery. The internal procedures for determining breaches of conduct and imposing "proportionate" sanctions are designed to ensure accountability and proper use of resources. The screening process for re-employing individuals who received previous Commonwealth redundancy benefits also reflects a commitment to preventing wasteful spending.</p>
<p><strong>Limited Government:</strong><br />
The AEC's role as an <strong>"independent statutory authority"</strong> tasked with maintaining a fair and impartial electoral system inherently supports the principle of limited government by ensuring a legitimate process for citizens to choose their representatives. The strict controls over the <strong>electoral roll data</strong> (e.g., prohibition on its sale post-2004, and specific referrals for requests) demonstrate an understanding of the government's responsibility to manage, rather than indiscriminately disseminate, sensitive citizen information. The detailed policies and procedures governing employee conduct, resource use, and public engagement also aim to ensure transparent and accountable governance.</p>
<p>However, the intensive internal regulatory framework, including lengthy induction programs and detailed behavioral guidelines, combined with the mandatory COVID-19 vaccination policy, could be seen as a tendency towards <strong>over-regulation and bureaucratic expansion</strong> that, if not constantly re-evaluated for efficiency and necessity, could subtly undermine the spirit of limited government.</p>

      <p>The FOI documents from the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) reveal an organization heavily focused on internal bureaucratic processes, compliance, and control, often at the expense of transparency and efficiency.</p>
<p><strong>Key Findings Suggesting Waste, Overreach, or Questionable Decision-Making:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Overreach into Staff Personal Lives and Freedom of Expression:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The "Acknowledgement and Declaration of Key Obligations" mandates strict "political neutrality" for all staff, demanding they are "not currently publicly active in political affairs" and must immediately report any "perception" of political involvement. This policy extends AEC control beyond work duties into employees' private lives, effectively stifling free speech and encouraging self-censorship for job security.</li>
<li>The "Letter of Engagement" explicitly makes adherence to the AEC's COVID-19 Vaccination Policy a "condition of engagement," with non-compliance potentially leading to termination. This represents a significant overreach into personal health decisions as a requirement for government employment.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Bureaucratic Inefficiency and High Overhead:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The "National Induction Program" is an extensive, multi-phase, five-month program for new staff, replete with "modules," "check-in points," "local induction advisers" (a "voluntary role" implying reliance on unpaid goodwill), and various mandatory e-learning courses. This suggests a significant bureaucratic investment in internal "culture" and "values" alignment, potentially diverting resources from core electoral functions.</li>
<li>The "Public Engagement Team Handbook" details highly inefficient manual processes. Staff are required to manually check "Personal Message Manager (PMM)" spam filters for <em>three</em> shared mailboxes <em>daily</em>, indicating either poor automated systems or excessive caution absorbing significant staff time.</li>
<li>Changing automated public information messages (IVR for the 13 23 26 number) requires submitting an IT request with "a week's notice," demonstrating a slow and cumbersome process for critical public communication updates.</li>
<li>The compilation of "Complaints Management Reports" is an intensely manual and complex process, involving specific Excel filters, and warnings against common data manipulation errors, highlighting significant bureaucratic overhead and a system prone to human error, consuming considerable staff hours.</li>
<li>Even essential services like interpreter calls face bureaucratic hurdles, requiring annual "Spending Approval forms" and detailed invoice checks "to ensure it does not exceed the spending approval amount," showing a focus on micro-managing costs over seamless service delivery.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Lack of Transparency and Information Control:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>While the FOI request explicitly asked for "Memoranda of understanding setting out arrangements for liaison between the AEC and the Australian Federal Police," these documents are conspicuously absent from the "SCHEDULE OF RELEASED DOCUMENTS," raising serious concerns about a lack of transparency regarding inter-agency operations, particularly concerning policing and information sharing.</li>
<li>The AEC's shift in policy regarding the electoral roll, where it was "freely available for purchase" pre-2004 but "prohibited from sale" and "no longer provided to libraries" post-2004, indicates a clear move towards greater restriction of public access to historical and current electoral data.</li>
<li>All "Freedom of Information (FOI) Requests" must be funneled through the "Legal Services mailbox," adding an extra layer of bureaucracy and potentially delaying responses or limiting direct access to information handlers.</li>
<li>The "AEC Procedures for Determining Breaches of the APS Code of Conduct" states that "A formal hearing is not required" for misconduct determinations, reducing transparency and due process for employees accused of breaches. Furthermore, the record of determination is subject to the "Privacy Act 1988," limiting public accountability for internal misconduct.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In summary, these documents paint a picture of a government agency prioritizing internal control, rigid compliance, and bureaucratic process over agile operations and open information practices, raising questions about potential waste, stifling of dissent, and a general lack of external accountability.</p>

    <div class="ai-summary-markdown-content">
      <p>These FOI documents unequivocally illustrate the Australian Electoral Commission's (AEC) unwavering commitment to effective governance, necessary regulations, and serving the public good with the utmost integrity.</p>
<p>The released materials demonstrate a meticulously structured framework for <strong>maintaining high standards of public service conduct and accountability</strong>. The 'AEC Procedures for Determining Breaches of the APS Code of Conduct and Sanctions' (December 2018) outlines a fair, transparent, and proportionate process for addressing any staff conduct issues, ensuring that public trust is always upheld. This is further reinforced by the comprehensive 'Acknowledgement and Declaration of Key Obligations' and the 'Letter of Engagement' for new employees, which clearly articulate the critical importance of political neutrality, conflict of interest avoidance, and adherence to all relevant legislation, including the Public Service Act and the Privacy Act, from day one.</p>
<p>The government's dedication to <strong>professionalism and service excellence</strong> in public engagement is a recurring theme. The 'APS1 Induction and Training Booklet' and the 'Public Engagement Team Handbook' (November 2022) showcase robust training programs grounded in the AEC's core values of Electoral Integrity, Quality, Agility, and Professionalism. Staff are rigorously trained in handling public inquiries, managing challenging interactions (as highlighted by the 'Dealing with Difficult Behaviour' intranet page), and adhering to strict service level standards. The provision of interpreter services and the National Relay Service underscores a proactive commitment to ensuring accessible and equitable service for all citizens.</p>
<p>A significant emphasis is placed on <strong>data security and privacy</strong>, with stringent protocols detailed to protect sensitive electoral and personal information. Employees are thoroughly educated on their responsibilities under the Privacy Act, Commonwealth Electoral Act, and Crimes Act, demonstrating the government's profound commitment to safeguarding citizen data.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the 'National Induction Program' (Outline, Curriculum Overview, Roles and Responsibilities) exemplifies a forward-thinking approach to <strong>talent development and continuous improvement</strong>. Its multi-phased curriculum and clearly defined roles for line managers, induction advisers, and executive officers ensure that all new public servants are deeply embedded in the agency's values, operational requirements, and the broader context of Australia's democratic process.

      <p>The provided FOI documents paint a damning picture of the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC), revealing a bureaucratic culture steeped in control, fear, and a concerning lack of transparency and accountability, particularly regarding legal breaches and public engagement.</p>
<p><strong>Failure of Transparency and Evasion of FOI Request:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The FOI request explicitly asked for "any limitation, restriction or prohibition authorised by the AEC on telephone communication of its staff with members of the public, including call filtering," and "Memoranda of understanding setting out arrangements for liaison between the AEC and the Australian Federal Police concerning the sharing of information, handling of complaints and other operational matters."</li>
<li><strong>Failure:</strong> No specific policy outlining "limitations, restrictions, or prohibitions" on <em>outbound</em> staff communication was provided. The "Public Engagement Team Handbook" details how <em>incoming</em> calls are filtered and how staff can <em>use</em> interpreter services, but not how <em>staff are prohibited or restricted from initiating calls</em>. This is a clear evasion of the request, suggesting either an absence of such policies or a deliberate withholding.</li>
<li><strong>Damning Implication:</strong> The complete absence of any AFP Memoranda of Understanding (MOUs) is highly concerning. Given the AEC's role in maintaining electoral integrity, the lack of formal, documented arrangements with the federal police for sharing information or handling complaints about potential breaches of electoral law implies either gross negligence, an intention to handle all such matters internally without external oversight, or a deliberate refusal to disclose these critical documents under FOI. This suggests a system designed to shield the AEC from external investigation and accountability.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Culture of Fear, Control, and Distrust:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Political Neutrality as Thought Control:</strong> The "Acknowledgement and Declaration of Key Obligations" and "Letter of Engagement" impose extreme conditions on staff political neutrality, requiring them to declare they are "not currently publicly active in political affairs" and will not "publicly engage in such activities." The use of "perception that the person is involved with such activity" as a basis for "sanction, including termination" is an alarming overreach, designed to chill legitimate civic engagement and force self-censorship, extending the AEC's control into employees' private lives, especially via social media.</li>
<li><strong>Pervasive Surveillance and Disproportionate Liability:</strong> The "APS1 Induction and training booklet" explicitly states, "The AEC actively monitors computer and systems usage," and warns of "significant consequences for any breach, including the possibility of legal proceedings." Employees are "personally responsible for securing your login and password details, and for all activity on the systems undertaken using your login." This creates an environment of pervasive surveillance and places extreme personal liability on staff for actions that could be due to systemic vulnerabilities or genuine errors, fostering a climate of fear rather than trust.</li>
<li><strong>Micro-management and Internal Policing:</strong> The "APS1 Induction and training booklet" and "Public Engagement Team Handbook" are replete with micro-managing instructions, from email etiquette ("Do not write in UPPERCASE or bold") to strict privacy rules ("You must never look up a friend or colleague’s address"). The directive to report colleagues ("If you become aware that a staff member is mishandling personal information... report the matter to a senior officer as soon as you can") fosters an internal "snitch" culture, undermining collegiality and trust.</li>
<li><strong>Barriers to Public Access:</strong> The "Public Engagement Team Handbook" details strict protocols for public contact, including not transferring calls from the public to Senior Executive Staff (requiring a message to be taken instead) and extreme secrecy around staff contact details ("You may not confirm any of the following information to a caller: whether a person works for the AEC, a person’s work number, a person’s email address"). This creates an opaque barrier between the public and senior AEC officials, insulating the leadership from direct scrutiny.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Incompetence and Negligence in Staff Management and Training:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Outdated Policies and Neglect:</strong> The "AEC Procedures for Determining Breaches of the APS Code of Conduct and Sanctions" document is dated December 2018, with a "Next review date" of November 2019. Its outdated status, despite more recent documents being provided, indicates a significant organizational neglect of critical internal governance and staff accountability frameworks.</li>
<li><strong>Exploitative and Inadequate Training for Frontline Staff:</strong><ul>
<li>The "APS1 Induction and training booklet" reveals heavy reliance on casual APS1 staff for "peak workload periods" and core "administrative and processing support," demanding work "at short notice" and "a number of weekends." This is a clear indicator of under-resourcing and exploitative practices towards temporary employees, who are placed under immense pressure.</li>
<li>Crucially, the "National Induction Program: Outline" explicitly states, "APS1 and staff identified to fill key election specific roles are outside scope for this program." This creates a glaring two-tiered system where the most vulnerable, high-turnover, and often public-facing staff (APS1s) are deliberately excluded from the "nationally consistent induction" deemed essential for other levels. This exposes them to inadequate training and support for critical electoral functions, severely compromising their ability to perform effectively and reliably.</li>
<li>The reliance on a "70:20:10 learning model" means only 10% of training is "structured," pushing the burden of learning onto "experience" and "others." For casual, excluded APS1 staff, this means insufficient formal training and reliance on potentially untrained peers, setting them up for failure. The "quality assurance processes" that "identify any enrolment processing errors" for "learning progress" are likely to be punitive rather than supportive, shifting blame for systemic training failures onto individual staff.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Fatigue and Worker Safety Acknowledged but Unaddressed:</strong> The "APS1 Induction and training booklet" chillingly admits, "Fatigue is an ever-present risk in the AEC... and can't always be prevented, but must always be managed." This is an admission of failure to adequately protect staff from known occupational hazards, particularly given the reliance on casual staff for demanding, high-pressure election periods.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Concealment of Legal Breaches and Systemic Secrecy:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Internal Control of Complaints and Fraud:</strong> The "Public Engagement Team Handbook" directs "Complaints of possible breaches of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918, and/or other Commonwealth legislation, such as the Privacy Act 1988," to the "Chief Legal Officer in our Legal Services area" and "All potential cases of enrolment fraud should now be forwarded to RMCE in the first instance."</li>
<li><strong>Damning Implication:</strong> This explicitly centralizes the handling of potential criminal offenses and legal breaches <em>within</em> the AEC's internal legal and fraud teams, rather than immediately involving external law enforcement like the AFP. The lack of any disclosed AFP MOUs, combined with this internal triage mechanism, strongly suggests a deliberate policy of managing, containing, and potentially concealing allegations of legal misconduct and fraud internally, thereby avoiding external scrutiny, prosecution, and accountability. This is a profound failure of public duty and a direct threat to the integrity of the electoral process.</li>
<li><strong>Restrictive Data Access:</strong> The policy on electoral roll data, stating it is "exempt from the FOI Act" and that "The AEC does not have publicly-available historic rolls," further highlights a culture of secrecy regarding fundamental electoral information.</li>
</ul>
<p>In conclusion, the documents reveal an AEC that prioritizes control, internal management of potentially criminal conduct, and extreme political neutrality at the expense of staff well-being, transparency, and robust external accountability. The systemic exclusion and inadequate training of frontline casual staff, coupled with an oppressive oversight environment, paints a damning picture of a commission seemingly more concerned with self-preservation and image control than with open governance and the welfare of its most vulnerable employees.</p>

Objective 
These procedures outline the steps that will be taken by the AEC when investigating a breach of the 
APS Code of Conduct, and when determining any sanctions that arise from that investigation. 

Definitions 
Act 

means the Public Service Act 1999. 

Agency 

has the same meaning as in the Act. 

APS Employee 

means an APS Employee as defined in the Act. 

AEC 

Code 

means the Australian Electoral Commission. 

means the APS Code of Conduct in section 13 of the Public Service Act 1999. 

Deputy Electoral 
Commissioner 

means the person from time to time holding, occupying or performing the 
duties of the position of Electoral Commissioner as described in section 19 of 
the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918. 

Electoral 
Commissioner 

means the person from time to time holding, occupying or performing the 
duties of the position of Electoral Commissioner as described in section 18 of 
the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918. The Electoral Commissioner is an 
&#34;Agency Head&#34; for the purposes of the Act (paragraph 29(2)(b) of the 
Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918). 

Application 
1. Application of the Procedures 
1.1  The Procedures apply in determining whether an APS employee, has breached the Code in 

section 13 of the Act.  

1.2    In these Procedures, unless the contrary intention appears, a reference to: 

a)  an APS employee includes reference to a former APS employee who is suspected of 

having breached the Code while an employee in the AEC; and  

b)  a breach of the Code by a person includes a reference to a person engaging in conduct 

set out in subsection 15(2A) of the Act in connection with their engagement as an APS 

employee. 

1.3. In accordance with subsection 15(7) of the Act, these procedures are publicly available on the 

AEC’s website. 

Note:   The Procedures apply only in relation to a suspected breach of the Code by an APS employee 

in respect of which a determination is to be made. Not all suspected breaches of the Code 
may need to be dealt with by way of a determination. In particular circumstances, another 
way of dealing with a suspected breach of the Code may be more appropriate. 

These Procedures are not legislative instruments (see subsection 15(8) of the Act).

Principles   
2       Who may determine a breach of the Code and impose a sanction 
Note: 

 Clause 40 of the Australian Public Service Commissioner’s Directions 2016 provides that where the 
conduct of an APS employee raises concerns that relate both to effective performance and possible 
breaches of the Code, the Agency Head must, before making a decision to deal with a suspected 
breach under the formal misconduct provisions (being these Procedures), have regard to any relevant 
standards and guidance issued by the Australian Public Service Commissioner.  

Investigations of suspected misconduct by former employees can be undertaken, but sanctions cannot 
be imposed on former employees. 

2.1 

As soon as practicable after a suspected breach of the Code has been identified, the 
Electoral Commissioner or the Deputy Electoral Commissioner may deal with a suspected 
breach, in accordance with the Procedures, by: 

a)  making a written determination whether the APS employee has breached the Code; or 

b)  selecting the person  to make a determination whether the APS employee has breached 

the Code (the breach decision maker).  

Note: 

The Australian Public Service Commissioner’s prior written consent is required if a non APS 
employee will be selected as the breach decision maker / sanction delegate (subsection 78(8) 
of the Act).  

An internal or external investigator may be appointed by the breach decision maker to 
investigate the alleged breach, gather evidence and present a report of factual findings, 
including recommendations.  

The person making the decision on the sanction must hold a delegation under the Act to do 
so (the sanction delegate). 

Note: These Procedures do not prevent the breach decision maker from being the sanction decision 
maker in the same matter. 

Subject to clause 2.3 above, these procedures do not prevent the breach decision maker 
from being the sanction delegate in the same matter. 

The Australian Public Service Commission publication ‘Handling Misconduct Managers Guide 
’, is a recommended resource available to the Breach Decision Maker and Sanction Delegate, 
to support them in making the determination and sanction decision.  

Determination process 
The process for determining whether an APS employee has breached the Code must be 
carried out with as little formality, and with as much expedition, as a proper consideration of 
the matter allows. 

The process must be consistent with the principles of procedural fairness. 

A formal hearing is not required in order for a person to determine whether an APS 
employee has breached the Code. 

Information to be given to employee before a determination is made 
A determination may not be made in relation to a suspected breach of the Code by an APS 
employee unless reasonable steps have been taken to inform the employee of:

2.4 

2.5

a)  the details of the suspected breach of the Code including any variation of those details; 

and 

b)  the sanctions that may be imposed on the employee under subsection 15(1) of the Act. 

4.2 

A person who is making a determination in relation to a suspected breach of the Code by an 
APS employee must give that employee a reasonable opportunity to make an oral and/or 
written statement, in relation to the suspected breach.  This statement may be made to the 
Breach Decision Maker or to the appointed investigator: 

a)  within seven days of the APS employee being informed of the details (or any variation of 

those details) of the suspected breach; or 

b)  such longer period as is allowed.  

4.3 

4.4

5.1 

5.2 

6 
6.1 

6.2 

6.3 

6.4 

An APS employee who does not make a statement in relation to the suspected breach is not, 
only for that reason, to be taken to have admitted committing the suspected breach. 

The breach decision maker or the investigator may agree to a request made by the APS 
employee who is suspected of breaching the Code to have a support person present in a 
meeting or interview they conduct.  The support person cannot speak or advocate on the 
employees behalf. 

Persons involved in making a determination or imposing a sanction to be 
independent and unbiased 
The breach decision maker, any investigator assisting the breach decision maker and the 
sanction delegate must be, and must appear to be, independent and unbiased. 

A person must not determine whether an APS employee has breached the Code if the 
person has previously made a report in relation to all or any matter suspected of 
constituting the breach by the employee. 

Sanctions 
If a determination is made that an APS employee has breached the Code, the APS employee 
may be subject to the imposition of a sanction under section 15 of the Act. 

Sanctions are intended to be proportionate to the nature of the breach, and provide a clear 
message to the relevant employee that their behaviour was unacceptable. 

The process for deciding on sanction must be consistent with the principles of procedural 
fairness. 

If a determination is made that an APS employee has breached the Code, a sanction may not 
be imposed on the employee unless reasonable steps have been taken to: 

a) 

inform the APS employee of: 

i. 

ii. 

iii. 

the determination that has been made; 

the sanction or sanctions that are under consideration; and 

the factors that are under consideration in determining any sanction to be 

imposed; and 

4


--- Page 6 ---

b)  give the APS employee a reasonable opportunity to make a written statement in relation 

to the sanction or sanctions under consideration within 7 calendar days, or any longer 

period that is allowed by the sanction delegate. 

Note:   The sanction delegate may decide to give the employee the opportunity to make both a 

written and an oral statement. 

7 
7.1 

Record of determination and sanction 
If a determination is made in relation to a suspected breach of the Code by an APS 
employee, a written record must be made of: 

a)  the suspected breach; and  

b)  the determination; and  

c)  any sanctions imposed as a result of a determination that the employee breached the 

Code; and 

d)  if a statement of reasons was given to the employee – the statement of reasons.  

Note:   The Archives Act 1983 and the Privacy Act 1988 apply to a record made under this clause. 

8 
8.1 

Procedures where basis of engagement in the AEC changes or ends 
This clause applies where an APS employee is suspected of having breached the Code and a 
determination has not been made in relation to the suspected breach before: 

a)  the basis of the employee&#39;s engagement in the AEC changes; or 

b)  the employee moves to another Agency, 

Note:   Examples of a change in the basis of an APS employee&#39;s engagement in an Agency are as follows: 

a)  a change from engagement for a specified term, or for the duration of a specified task, to 

engagement as an ongoing APS employee; 

b)  a change from engagement for duties that are irregular or intermittent to engagement as an 

ongoing APS employee. 

8.2 

If the basis of the APS employee&#39;s engagement in the AEC has changed before a 
determination is made in relation to the suspected breach, the determination must be made 
in accordance with the procedures applicable to the basis of the employee&#39;s engagement in 
the AEC at the time the process for determining whether the employee has breached the 
Code is commenced. 

8.3 

Movements (including promotions) will not take effect until the matter is resolved, unless 
both Agency Heads agree otherwise. 

Note: The matter is taken to be resolved when: 

a)  a determination is made; or 

b) 

it is decided that a determination is not necessary.

Acceptance declaration 
Initial each declaration 

I acknowledge that, in recognition of the requirement for political neutrality by the Australian Electoral 
Commission (AEC), a condition of my engagement is to maintain political neutrality during the period of 
my engagement with the AEC. 

I understand that I am required to take reasonable steps to avoid any conflict of interest (real or 
apparent) in connection with my engagement with the AEC. I understand that this requires me to notify 
my manager/supervisor in a timely manner of any circumstance that may give rise to a real or apparent 
conflict of interest, including any other employment I may engage in. 

I declare that I am not currently publicly active in political affairs and do not intend to publicly engage in 
such activities during my engagement with the AEC. Should a situation arise during my engagement 
where I wish to publicly engage in political activities, or where there may be a perception that I am 
involved in political activities, I will discuss the matter with my manager/supervisor immediately. 

I declare that I have not provided false or misleading information or documents, or omitted to provide 
pertinent information or documents, to the AEC or to any other person or organisation acting on behalf 
of the AEC1, in connection with my engagement by the AEC. 

I understand that I am required to take reasonable care for my own health and safety and to take 
reasonable care to ensure my own acts or omissions do not adversely affect other persons. I also 
understand that I am required to follow the AEC&#39;s reasonable instructions, policies and procedures on 
Workplace Health and Safety. 

I acknowledge that I have been provided with a list highlighting certain relevant legislation, policies and 
procedures applying to engagement in the Australian Electoral Commission listed in this Declaration 
and that these legislative provisions and policies apply throughout my engagement with the AEC2. 

I acknowledge that it is my responsibility to be familiar with the legislation, policies and procedures 
applying to my work3. 

I acknowledge that these legislative provisions and policies apply throughout my engagement with the 
Australian Electoral Commission. 

I understand my obligation to perform my duties in a manner that ensures the security, integrity and 
accountability of all Ballot Papers that are in my possession or with which I may come into contact.

Policy.  

Australian Citizenship 

1.4.  To be eligible for APS employment with the AEC you must be an Australian citizen. 
1.5.  Prior to your engagement you must provide proof of your Australian Citizenship. This might be an 

Australian passport or notice of evidence of Australian Citizenship (usually an Australian Citizenship 
certificate). An Australian birth certificate may not, of itself, be proof of Australian Citizenship. 

Character Clearance 

1.6.  Engagement is subject to the AEC being satisfied that employees are of suitable character to be 
employed in the Australian Public Service (APS). Your engagement is subject to the passing of a 
character assessment, including a nationally coordinated criminal history check (police check). The 
AEC currently uses Equifax Australia Pty Ltd, an authorised agent of the Australian Criminal 
Intelligence Commission (ACIC), for the processing of these police checks, through the Fit2Work 
portal. You will receive your unique Fit2Work login details via SMS or email to complete the process 
securely online. 

1.7.  Additional information may also be sought and considered by the AEC from time to time to determine 

if you are of suitable character. Such additional information may include but is not limited to: 
a. 
b. 

The outcome of any legal proceedings against you;

character for APS employment or if it becomes clear that a satisfactory security clearance will not be 
obtained or if a security clearance is refused. 

Political Neutrality 

1.9.  The AEC must maintain strict political neutrality and cannot employ anyone who publicly engages in 
political activities or who intends to do so, or where there is a perception that the person is involved 
with such activity. 

1.10.  Should a situation arise during your employment where you wish to publicly engage in political 

activities, or where there may be a perception that you are involved in political activities, you must 
immediately discuss the matter with your manager. If you fail to do so sanction, including termination 
of your employment, may be imposed upon you.

Probation 

1.11.  A six month probation period applies to all ongoing employees new to the APS, upon commencement 

with the AEC. During this period, your conduct and work performance will be assessed to determine 
your suitability for ongoing employment. If your conduct or work performance is assessed as being 
unsatisfactory during this period, your employment may be terminated on the grounds of failure to 
meet the conditions of your probation. 

1.12.  The six month probation period may be extended if: 

a. 

you are absent from work for a significant part of the initial six months due to circumstances 
beyond your control (e.g. ill health, injury or accident, jury duty, etc.) and your absence 
prevents an adequate assessment of your performance; or 
due to other factors, your manager is unable to make a determination at the end of six months, 
but believes that you are likely to meet probation within an additional period of time. 
1.13.  In either circumstance, the probation period will not exceed nine months in total. If you require a copy 

b. 

of the AEC’s Probation Policy please contact Recruitment@aec.gov.au.

certain restrictions on the employment, in the APS, of persons who have received a redundancy 
benefit from the Commonwealth Government or from the Australian Parliamentary Service for which 
the redundancy benefit period has not ended. 

False or Misleading Information

misleading. This includes, but is not limited to, supplying the AEC with false or misleading information 
during the recruitment and engagement process.

1.18.  You should fully familiarise yourself with your obligations before commencing with the AEC. Particular 
attention should be paid to the APS Code of Conduct and APS Values. More information in regard to 
these can be found at https://www.apsc.gov.au/working-aps.  

COVID -19 Vaccination Requirement 

1.19.  It is a condition of engagement with the AEC that you comply with the AEC’s COVID-19 Vaccination 

Policy. You can comply with the Policy by having received the primary dosage of any COVID-19 
vaccine approved at the time, or having an exemption approved by the AEC.  
a. 

Currently, primary dosage means two doses of an approved vaccine, according to Federal 
Government recommendations. However, if you are required under state or territory guidelines 
to have a booster vaccination to undertake certain activities in your role (e.g. to attend high risk 
settings), you will be required to have additional dose(s), when eligible. 

1.20.  You are required to provide accurate information about your COVID-19 vaccination status or have an 
approved exemption before being able to commence with the AEC. Upon commencing with the AEC, 
you will be required to provide evidence of your vaccination status, as per the AEC’s COVID-19 
Vaccination Policy. 

Failure to Meet a Condition of Engagement 

1.21.  If it becomes evident that you will not be able to satisfy any of the conditions of your engagement as 

described above, the AEC’s offer of employment to you may be withdrawn or, if you have already 
commenced, your employment may be terminated. 

1.22.  In accordance with subsection 29(1) of the PS Act you will be provided written notice that your offer of 

employment has been withdrawn or your employment terminated. 

Reasonable Adjustment Support 

1.23.  If you have not received your primary vaccination dosage, the AEC will also consider the reason why 
you are unable to be vaccinated and whether it is reasonably practicable for you to be assigned a role 
which does not require you to obtain primary dosage. 

1.24.  The AEC will take into account any reasonable adjustments required to accommodate pre-existing 
conditions or disabilities. You may be required to undertake a medical examination or some other 
form of expert assessment (such as an eyesight test) before commencing your employment.   
1.25.  If you identify with a disability the AEC also has a Disability Contact Officer available to directly 
provide support, information and resources related to accessibility and workplace participation, 
contact DisabilityContactOfficer@aec.gov.au for more information. 

2. TERMS OF EMPLOYMENT

http://www.aec.gov.au/About_AEC/Publications/enterprise-agreement/contents.htm and any 
subsequent enterprise or collective agreement. The AEC Enterprise Agreement (including any 
subsequent enterprise agreement that may apply during your employment) is not a term of this 
contract.

superannuation component. You may be eligible to:

or your financial advisor.  Please note the AEC is not authorised to supply any advice on 
superannuation.

2.5.  Should you have any prior service with the APS, or in government service (as defined in section 10 of 

the Long Service Leave (Commonwealth Employees) Act 1976, or a service referred to in section

recognition will be subject to confirmation that any break in employment between employers was no 
more than twelve months.

About the AEC 

The AEC’s purpose 

The Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) is an independent statutory authority established by the 
Australian Government and our purpose is to: 

Maintain an impartial and independent electoral system for eligible voters through active 
electoral roll management, efficient delivery of polling services and targeted education 
and public awareness programs 

We do this by: 

■  ensuring confidence in the Commonwealth electoral roll 

■  conducting successful electoral events, including federal elections, by-elections, 

referendums and industrial elections and ballots 

■  undertaking public awareness activities 

■ 

regulating political party registrations and financial disclosure 

■  supporting electoral redistributions1. 

Structure of the AEC 

Three tier structure 

The AEC has a three-tier structure: 

■  a national office in Canberra 

■  state and territory offices, and 

■  divisional offices. 

National office 

There are three divisions in the national office – the Service Delivery Division, the Enabling and 
Regulation Division and the Organisational Transformation Division – headed by the agency&#39;s three 
first assistant commissioners. The First Assistant Commissioner, Service Delivery Division is the 
National Election Manager.

State offices 

State offices are located in each state capital. The Northern Territory office is in Darwin. The 
Australian Capital Territory (ACT) is managed by the NSW State Manager except during election 
periods, when an Australian Electoral Officer (AEO) for the ACT is appointed. 

Divisional offices 

Divisional offices are responsible for electoral administration within each electoral division, which 
includes the conduct of elections, management of the electoral roll and carrying out public awareness 
activities. Some divisions are located in a standalone office, while others are co-located with other 
divisions and operate as larger work units. 

Electoral divisions are also known as electorates. There are 151 electoral divisions in Australia, and 
each electoral division is represented by a member of the House of Representatives.  

The AEC values and commitments 

The AEC’s values of electoral integrity through quality, agility and professionalism, supported by the 
organisational commitment to the ballot paper principles and every task matters principle, were first 
introduced in February 2015. 

Since then, the AEC values and commitments have been a fundamental part of the AEC; forming a 
values and behaviours framework that has underpinned everything the AEC does as individuals and 
as an organisation. 

Defining the AEC values 

Each value has been defined to support all staff in having a common understanding of what each 
value means. The definition for each value is written as a ‘We statement’ to reflect its connection to 
the AEC’s purpose and vision: 

Our purpose is to maintain an impartial and independent electoral system for eligible voters 
through active electoral roll management, efficient delivery of polling services, and targeted 
education and public awareness programs. 

Our vision – We are a leader in refining and delivering best practice in election management. 

The definitions are supported by I statements that provide examples of what each value looks like in 
action (i.e. a guide of the behaviours expected of AEC staff). These statements will help staff identify 
and promote behaviours around the workplace that demonstrate Electoral 
Integrity through Professionalism, Agility, and Quality. 

A spotlight on each value, can be found on the AEC values launch page on the Intranet. 

Electoral integrity 

We provide electoral services to deliver the franchise 

We are neutral, transparent, and accountable in the preparation and conduct of electoral processes

the APS Code of Conduct. 

I recognise and value the contribution of others. 

I follow through reliably and take personal responsibility for my actions and decisions and their 
consequences. 

■ 

I take pride in doing my job well 

Every task matters 

We have a mantra at the AEC that ‘every task matters’, so it is expected that all staff conduct AEC 
business in a professional manner - regardless of the task, no matter how big or how small. It is 
critical that staff follow all AEC procedures at all times; delivering high quality electoral events that 
are transparent and uphold the AEC’s reputation as a leading electoral management body.  

Ballot paper principles 

The AEC upholds the sanctity of the ballot paper in all its forms and at all times. This is given effect 
through two principles: 

■  All ballot papers remain ‘live’ from printing through to statutorily authorised destruction. 

■  The security, integrity and accountability of ballot papers must be preserved at all times – 

including transit and storage by the AEC, contractors, or other third parties. 

These principles underpin all AEC planning, training, systems, handling and practices associated 
with ballot papers. They show how important ballot paper security is and provides a basis for the 
treatment of every ballot paper from printing to destruction by anyone who handles ballot papers, 
including but not limited to staff, polling officials and contractors.  

Visual representation of the values and commitments 

The values and commitments are captured in one visual representation (see below) to frame and 
guide how we work and underpin everything we do. This is displayed in all AEC offices and should 
act as a daily reminder of the importance of modelling these core values. It is important to continually 
talk about the values and commitments and how they apply to you as an individual and as an 
organisation.

The APS values set out the parliament’s expectations, behaviours and performance standards of 
staff working in the APS. You must at all times ensure your behaviours meet these standards which 
can be remembered by the acronym ICARE. 

The APS values 

Impartial 

The APS is apolitical and provides the government with advice that is frank, honest, 
timely and based on the best available evidence. 

Committed to service 

The APS is professional, objective, innovative and efficient, and works collaboratively 
to achieve the best results for the Australian community and the government. 

Accountable  

The APS is open and accountable to the Australian community under the law and 
within the framework of ministerial responsibility. 

Respectful  

The APS respects all people, including their rights and their heritage. 

Ethical 

The APS demonstrates leadership, is trustworthy, and acts with integrity, in all that it 
does. 

The APS Code of Conduct is set out in s13 of the Public Service Act 1999 and lists the expected 
behaviours and actions required of all staff working in the APS. This is not about how well you do 
your job, but how you behave when undertaking your role. 

A breach of the Code of Conduct can result in sanctions, ranging from a reprimand to termination of 
employment. 

The Code of Conduct can be found on the following page. A brochure with more information is 
available on the APSC website: https://www.apsc.gov.au/publication/aps-values-and-code-conduct-
practice

The Code of Conduct 

The Code of Conduct requires that an APS employee must: 

  behave honestly and with integrity in connection with APS employment; 

  act with care and diligence in connection with APS employment;

employee&#39;s Agency who has authority to give the direction; 

  maintain appropriate confidentiality about dealings that the employee has with 

any Minister or Minister&#39;s member of staff; 

 

take reasonable steps to avoid any conflict of interest (real or apparent) and 
disclose details of any material personal interest of the employee in 
connection with the employee&#39;s APS employment; 

  use Commonwealth resources in a proper manner and for a proper purpose; 

  not provide false or misleading information in response to a request for 
information that is made for official purposes in connection with the 
employee&#39;s APS employment; 

  not improperly use inside information or the employee&#39;s duties, status, power 

or authority: 

1.  to gain, or seek to gain, a benefit or an advantage for the employee or 

any other person; or 

2.  to cause, or to seek to cause, detriment to the employee&#39;s Agency, the 

Commonwealth or any other person.  

  at all times behave in a way that upholds the APS Values and Employment 
Principles, and the integrity and good reputation of the employee&#39;s Agency 
and the APS; 

  while on duty overseas, at all times behave in a way that upholds the good 

reputation of Australia; and 

  comply with any other conduct requirement that is prescribed by the 

regulations (regulations available on the ComLaw website). 

The Code of Conduct is set out in section 13 of the Public Service Act 1999.

APS1 Administration Assistant 

About your role 

An APS1 Administration Assistant is a casual staff member, usually located in a divisional, state or 
territory office or at an out-posted centre. Your primary role is to provide administrative and 
processing support to the office during peak workload periods. You have been employed to provide 
administrative support to your office in the lead up to, and during, the next federal election. The work 
you will be doing is vitally important to the delivery of a successful election, and we will train and 
support you to do your tasks well. 

We aim to give you as much notice as we can, but during the election you may be asked to stay at 
work to complete a task at short notice. You should also expect to work a number of weekends 
during the election period. 

Duties 

Your duties will include: 

■  handling counter and telephone enquiries 

■  checking and responding to emails 

■  preparing routine correspondence using automated systems 

■  performing photocopying, scanning, collating and mailing documents 

■  processing enrolment forms from clients applying to enrol or updating their 

existing enrolment details 

■  helping to maintain the address register 

■  handling postal vote applications and returned postal vote certificates (during an 

election) 

■  processing declaration vote envelopes to determine if the voter is able to have 

their vote counted (during an election) 

■  other tasks and projects as directed. 

Performance plan 

It is a requirement for all Australian Government employees (ongoing and non-ongoing) to have an 
individual performance plan (IPP). An IPP is linked to organisational and business goals and 
maintains the APS and AEC values. It also provides employees with a clear statement of 
performance expectations. 

Your manager will meet with you to put your IPP in place and will advise if it will be done through the 
Aurion Employee Self Service (ESS) facility or the IPP agreement and review paper form. 

Agile pool 

You may be working in an agile pool of staff. This means that for certain tasks or projects you work 
on, you may be required to report to someone other than your line manager. Your line manager will 
remain your point of contact for your timesheets, individual performance plan and any other matters.

Training 

The AEC’s approach to learning is based on the 70:20:10 model. This is an approach where: 

■  70 per cent of learning is from experience – typically on the job experience and practice. 
Staff have access to self-directed learning tools, such as videos, asking the community, 
simulations, blogs, job aids and knowledge management systems. Staff benefit from short 
term secondments, job rotations and projects. 

■  20 per cent of learning is from others - both formal and informal coaching and mentoring 
from others, including participation in expert networks, forums and communities of practice. 

■  10 per cent of learning is structured - formal learning interventions and structured programs 

that can involve assessment, accreditation and a mix of classroom and eLearning. 

Mandatory eLearning courses  

A list of all mandatory eLearning courses that are required to be completed within the first four weeks 
of commencing duties with the AEC is located at Attachment A. These eLearning courses can be 
accessed and completed via AEC Learning.  

Other training resources 

There are also a number of optional training resources listed in Attachment A that provide context 
around various election activities. These courses should be completed at the discretion of your 
supervisor.  

Your supervisor will work closely with you as you begin to work on real enrolment forms and check 
your work to ensure they are satisfied with your learning. Where necessary, or if you request it, 
aspects of the training can be covered again until you are managing your work confidently and with 
success. 

We undertake quality assurance processes, such as the Enrolment Quality Assurance Program 
(EQAP) to identify any enrolment processing errors. This will also help inform your learning progress, 
and we will discuss with you any errors or issues identified through the program. 

 Page 12 

APS1 Induction and training booklet


--- Page 14 ---

Useful information 

Timesheets 

The Aurion Employee Self Service (ESS) facility is the system used to submit your timesheets. You 
can consult the Aurion ESS intranet page for user guides, forms and FAQs. Your supervisor will 
advise if you are required to use Aurion ESS to manage your timesheets. 

Workplace health and safety 

The AEC strives to maintain a workplace environment that demonstrably values health, safety and 
wellbeing. 

Your supervisor will ensure you take regular breaks, and you must take a break after five consecutive 
hours of duty. If you feel you are not being given sufficient breaks, raise this with your supervisor. 

AEC employees are also required to take reasonable care for their own health and safety and to 
ensure their own acts or omissions do not adversely affect others. You are required to follow 
reasonable instructions given by the AEC, and all AEC policies and procedures on Workplace Health 
and Safety.  

Visit the Health, Safety and Wellbeing page on the intranet for more information. 

Fatigue management 

Fatigue is a state of mental and/or physical exhaustion which reduces a person&#39;s ability to perform 
tasks safely and effectively. 

The AEC aims to create a safe and healthy work environment for all its workers, and prevent, as far 
as is reasonably practicable, fatigue affecting its workers. Fatigue is an ever-present risk in the AEC, 
in particular during election periods, and can&#39;t always be prevented, but must always be managed.  

Improving the way the AEC manages fatigue can significantly improve the performance of workers 
and teams. This improvement leads to a reduction in errors, improved workplace efficiency and the 
elimination of, or the minimisation of, health and safety risks to workers. The risks of workers 
experiencing fatigue arise from a range of sources and for a variety of reasons and can be different 
for each individual worker. Fatigue can be caused by work related factors, factors outside work 
and/or a combination of both and may accumulate over time.  

Your supervisor will discuss fatigue management with you, and the policies and support guides 
available. Visit the Fatigue management and prevention page on the intranet for more information. 

Security 

Security passes 

You will be issued with a security pass and you must wear it at all times while you are in an AEC 
office. You must take off your pass when outside the office. 

 Page 13 

APS1 Induction and training booklet


--- Page 15 ---

Systems and information security 

When you start, you will be given an AEC email address and access to the AEC’s intranet. You must 
follow AEC policies when using these systems, and relevant information is provided for you later in 
this booklet. 

As most of your work is systems based, you will also be given an individual login and password for 
each system you use. You are personally responsible for securing your login and password details, 
and for all activity on the systems undertaken using your login. The AEC actively monitors computer 
and systems usage. 

Misuse of our systems, unlawful access to the records of our clients or unlawful disclosure of 
information is taken very seriously by the AEC, and there are significant consequences for any 
breach, including the possibility of legal proceedings. 

Private use of IT systems and social media 

You are allowed to use the AEC’s computer network for private purposes, as long as it&#39;s reasonable 
(for example, internet banking). You are not permitted to access or download illicit data or 
information, such as pornography, hacking, peer-to-peer networking or pirated software. 

The AEC has important requirements that must be adhered to when it comes to the personal use of 
social media. You should consider the impact of your activities on the reputation of the AEC before 
you make a comment or produce any content on social media. Your actions online must not conflict 
with the AEC’s political impartiality requirement and should not compromise public confidence in the 
agency or the APS. 

Personal security 

Every AEC office has an emergency warden and some offices also have a first aid officer. Your 
induction to your local office will include information on evacuation procedures and an introduction to 
these officers. 

Visitors to AEC offices who are accessing parts of the office that are not designated reception areas 
will need to sign in, wear a visitor pass and be escorted at all times. If you notice a person in your 
office who is not wearing a visitor pass or is not being escorted, please alert your supervisor who will 
deal with the situation immediately. 

Telephone directories 

Up-to-date telephone directories for both divisional office staff and state office staff are available on 
the intranet and on the local state collaboration sites. Your supervisor will show you how to navigate 
these sites and access the telephone directories for your locality. 

You can also find details about individual officers on the intranet by using the ‘Search People’ facility 
in the top-right search bar, or by searching their name in Microsoft Teams. 

Multi-function devices and printers 

The AEC uses multi-function devices (MFDs), which provide staff with the ability to copy and print 
documents, and to scan and send documents to an email inbox. Unless your supervisor tells you 
otherwise, all of your printing must be in black and white. You will be provided with an access card to 
log you in to the MFD – this may be your building access card or a separate MFD card. 

 Page 14 

APS1 Induction and training booklet


--- Page 16 ---

When printing, be conscious of paper usage, but also of the currency of the document into the future. 
Documents like Quick Reference Guides often go out of date quickly when printed. 

More information and assistance on connecting to a printer can be accessed in the AEC Service 
Centre&#39;s Knowledge Hub, through searching &#39;printer&#39;. 

Microsoft teams (AEC Teams) 

Microsoft Teams is a communication platform where you can call, chat, meet and collaborate with 
AEC colleagues. The AEC has its own hosted implementation of Microsoft Teams, called AEC 
TEAMS. 

You should use AEC TEAMS for all your collaboration needs, such as chat with colleagues, meetings 
and also live events. You have AEC TEAMS installed on your desktop ready to use. 

More information and assistance on using AEC Teams can be accessed in the AEC Service Centre&#39;s 
Knowledge Hub, through searching &#39;Teams&#39;.

Privacy and security 

As a government authority handling personal information, the AEC has very strict rules about privacy 
and security. Many of us have access to electors’ personal information, including some information 
that is highly sensitive, and we must take care at all times to uphold our responsibilities. AEC staff 
members also have limited access to records of clients of other government agencies, and 
occasionally medical information about an individual client. 

Legislation 

When handling personal information AEC staff must comply with the Australian Privacy Principles 
(APPs) under the Privacy Act 1988. The purpose of the Privacy Act is to protect the privacy of 
individuals, and to protect personal information that is collected by entities such as the AEC. 

As an AEC employee accessing personal information, you are also bound by the requirements of the 
the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918, the Code of Conduct set out in the Public Service Act 1999 
and the Crimes Act 1914. Unlawful access, use or disclosure of elector information by an AEC staff 
member is a breach of the Code of Conduct and, in some cases, is also a criminal offence. 

The AEC publishes the following disclosure on our website: 

Under the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918, the electoral roll (containing 
names and addresses) may be supplied to prescribed authorities, members of 
parliament, political parties, approved medical researchers, public health 
programs and electoral researchers. It is also used to maintain joint 
Commonwealth and state and territory electoral rolls. 

This disclosure is therefore authorised by law. Only authorised delegates are permitted to provide 
that information. 

Mishandling of personal information 

Preserving the security of personal information is not only about ensuring compliance with the 
requirements of the Privacy Act 1988. The Australian Privacy Principles (APPs) outline how the AEC 
must handle, use and manage personal information. If we mishandle the personal information of our 
clients, it can cause them damage and, in turn, it can also lead to a loss of trust and considerable 
harm to our reputation. 

The community expects that their sensitive information will be given a higher level of protection than 
non-sensitive information. This expectation is reflected in the increased privacy protections that 
apply. Sensitive information could include the risk to a client’s personal safety or that of their family, a 
client’s movements overseas for work purposes (for example, for defence personnel), a client’s 
criminal sentence or health information that identifies an individual’s medical condition. 

The mishandling of sensitive information may: 

■  provide the basis for discrimination or other more severe types of harm 

■ 

■ 

 Page 16 

lead to humiliation or embarrassment, or undermine an individual’s dignity 

impact negatively on the AEC’s reputation. 

APS1 Induction and training booklet


--- Page 18 ---

Your responsibilities 

While employed by the AEC you must abide by all AEC privacy and security principles. You should 
also report to your supervisor if you see a colleague doing anything that is a breach of the rules or is 
not appropriate. 

■  You must never use AEC systems to access any enrolment record beyond the ones you need 
to process as part of your work. For example, you must never look up a friend or colleague’s 
address, birth date or telephone number. 

■  You must never leave your computer unlocked while you are away from your workstation, 

regardless of how long you are away, unless you can see your workstation for the entire time. 

■  You must lock away hardcopy enrolment records as per local filing protocols, including clients’ 
medical information, if you are away from your workstation for longer than 30 minutes and 
overnight. 

■  You must never record the specifics of a client’s medical condition (for example, ‘dementia’, 

‘schizophrenia’) in RMANS or GENESIS. 

■  You will need to use information from other government agencies (such as driver’s license 

details) so check with your supervisor about the correct use of the information. 

■  When talking to a client or other member of the public, you must never disclose information 
from their record unless you have confirmed you are talking to that individual. To confirm, 
ensure the person gives you identifying information; never offer it to them. 

■ 

Individuals who want the AEC to provide details of their enrolment record in writing must 
make the request in writing themselves, and the AEC will respond in writing. The response 
will only be given to the individual client. You won’t be required to do this but you may be 
called upon to give advice to clients on this matter. 

■  Regardless of a person’s official credentials (such as a police officer or lawyer), you must 
never provide information or copies of an enrolment record, whatever the status of that 
enrolment. Log all such requests in the Public Engagement Contact Tool and refer them to 
your supervisor. Ensure you upload any relevant documents into the Tool. 

■ 

If you become aware that a staff member is mishandling personal information, for example, 
accessing personal information for any purpose outside of official AEC duties, you should 
report the matter to a senior officer as soon as you can. 

More information is available on the Privacy page on the intranet.  

Protecting privacy – we all play a key role 

Privacy, and the proper management of personal information and data, is a critical responsibility for 
the AEC and its staff. 

Every day AEC staff handle the personal information of electors and staff with a high degree of care 
and accuracy. It is a fact though that, on occasion, mistakes occur due to human error. Any human 
error in the management of personal information can have a real human effect on those who entrust 
us with their information. 

Take the time to read the Quick reference guide on Privacy in Practice to help protect privacy and 
secure personal information.

Public enquiries  

When interacting with the public, AEC staff are required to follow these guidelines so we can provide 
consistent and professional client service. 

Quality client service 

The aim of the AEC’s public enquiry management is to fulfil our obligations under the AEC Service 
Charter. The Charter is a public-facing corporate document, informing the public of what to expect 
when interacting with the AEC and listing the reciprocated behaviours expected of the public by the 
AEC. 

The AEC asks staff to: 

■ 

take a positive helpful approach 

■  maintain sound and up-to-date knowledge of electoral processes 

■  consider how the client feels 

■  consider the individual circumstances of the client 

■ 

resolve enquiries in a timely manner. 

Service level standards 

The AEC is committed to providing timely responses, which means resolving enquiries at first point of 
contact whenever possible. If an enquiry needs further investigation, staff should ensure the relevant 
service level standards are met.  

The enquiry service level standards for our public contact channels are: 

Phone 

answered within 90 seconds 

Walk-in 

acknowledged within five minutes 

Email, post 

responded to within five working days 

Further information about the AEC’s service level standards can be found on the Public engagement 
and complaints management intranet page. 

Resolving straightforward enquiries at first point of contact 

Where possible, enquiries should be handled at the first point of contact by the person who initially 
received it and often at the same time it is received. 

You should attempt to resolve an enquiry when you receive it by: 

■ 

■ 

listening to the enquirer and acknowledging their concerns 

identifying the issue(s) 

■  clarifying anything that is unclear 

 Page 18 

APS1 Induction and training booklet


--- Page 20 ---

■  considering individual circumstances 

■  keeping it simple by limiting your use of jargon and acronyms 

■ 

taking personal responsibility for resolving the enquiry. 

Where appropriate, you should advise enquirers about the services available through our website: 
www.aec.gov.au.These services include checking their enrolment, updating their details or enrolling 
for the first time. 

You must record the details of the enquiry in the Public Engagement Contact Tool, including the 
response provided, and mark it as ‘resolved’. You must also attach a copy of any related 
correspondence.  

Handling more complex enquiries 

Complex enquiries, or those for which the information is not reasonably able to be found, must be 
referred to your supervisor. 

Enquiries from political parties, candidates and potential candidates must be referred to the Divisional 
Returning Officer as soon as possible. Record the details of the enquiry in the Public Engagement 
Contact Tool, and escalate it through the tool, attaching copies of related correspondence. 

Complaints 

All complaints are to be logged in the Public Engagement Contact Tool. 

Your supervisor will brief you on which complaints you can handle directly and which you should refer 
to a more senior staff member. 

Complaints should be acknowledged within three business days unless the matter can be resolved 
within three business days. If the matter needs to be referred for further advice, this must occur within 
one business day to allow maximum time for the matter to be resolved by the receiving officer. 

Complaints are to be resolved within 10 business days. A quick guide to complaints management 
provides further guidance on this process.  

AEC email protocol 

Emails are the main way we send important information to each other in the AEC or request action. 
In the course of your work, you may need to send emails to work colleagues or send responses to 
email enquiries from members of the public, so you will need to follow these guidelines. 

Setting up your email signature 

The AEC’s email system is accessed via Microsoft Outlook on your computer’s desktop. Before you 
use the email system you need to set up your email signature. This is the block of text that will 
appear at the bottom of every email you send. It lists your name, title and phone numbers. 

You can update your email signature block using the My Details tool, which is available to all staff via 
the Start Menu and All Programs. More information and assistance on updating your email 
signature can be accessed in the AEC Service Centre&#39;s Knowledge Hub, through searching 
&#39;signature&#39;.

APS1 Induction and training booklet

Drafting an internal email 

■ 

■ 

■ 

In the TO field: address the email to those AEC officers who need the information or who 
need to act. 

In the CC field: copy the email to other AEC staff who may need to be kept informed of the 
email request or the information being conveyed. This will usually include the relevant 
manager(s) of the primary addressees, and your own supervisor, and other AEC staff who 
have a need to know. If you are unsure, clarify this with your supervisor. 

In the SUBJECT field: at the beginning, indicate in capital letters whether the message is 
FOR INFORMATION or FOR ACTION. Clearly state the subject. If action is required, include 
a due date. 

When composing the main part of the email in the Content space, keep in mind these guidelines: 

■  Remember that all emails sent at work are documents that may be retrieved and possibly 

disclosed under Freedom of Information legislation (even when an email has been deleted). 

■  The content of emails should always be drafted in a polite, business-like and factual manner. 

■  Ensure your email contains your official AEC signature block (see above for the directions to 

set this up). 

Emails responding to enquiries by members of the public 

If you need to send emails in response to public enquiries, check with your supervisor about how to 
access standard responses to common requests on the AEC intranet and set them up using the 
Quick Steps facility in Outlook. 

Before sending an email 

■  Mark it with the appropriate security classification. Emails you send will either be marked as 

‘OFFICIAL’ or ‘UNOFFICIAL’. Check with your supervisor for the correct classification to use. 

■  Check that the recipients are correct and that if sending to multiple recipients the BCC field 

has been used to protect their privacy. 

■  Ensure any attachments are correct for the intended recipient to avoid revealing personal 

information to the wrong person. 

■  Reflect on the clarity, tone and content of your message, bearing in mind all emails are 

 Page 20 

APS1 Induction and training booklet


--- Page 22 ---

potentially disclosable in response to Freedom of Information requests. 

■  For further tips on writing, refer to the AEC’s style guide - AEC writing style. 

Recordkeeping requirements after sending 

If you are the person writing an original email (and not just replying to someone), your business area 
is most likely the ‘owner’ of the business activity or project that the email is about and it may need to 
be filed in the AEC’s electronic records management system, Objective IM. Check with your 
supervisor about whether any email correspondence you send needs to be uploaded to Objective IM. 

If you are required to use ObjectiveIM you will first need to complete the Information management 
and recordkeeping eLearning course prior to accessing ObjectiveIM. You can self-enrol in this 
eLearning course in AEC Learning.  

The Information and Knowledge Management (IKM) section provides instructor-led Objective training 
via MS Teams for all new staff at the AEC. To register to attend a session search for ‘ObjectiveIM’ in 
AEC Learning. For best results learners are encouraged to attend the training as soon as possible 
after completing the Information management and recordkeeping eLearning course. By the end of 
the training, you will be able to do the following within Objective: 

■  understand the AEC file structure 

■  upload and edit documents 

■  search for records 

■  upload emails 

■  send and access Objective link/reference 

■ 

rename files and edit/view metadata. 

Email etiquette 

Used properly, email can assist in maintaining good working relationships, increase productivity and 
provide efficiencies. Please follow this list of tips in your electronic communications: 

■  Communicate in clear, professional language. If in doubt, it is better to be overly formal rather 

than unprofessional. 

■  Do not send anything you would not be comfortable showing to your colleagues or being seen 

publicly. Consider that email is more like a postcard than a sealed envelope with a letter in it. 

■  Treat email like any other business communication; pay attention to spelling and grammar. 

Run the spell check if need be. 

■  Re-read and check what you have written before you send it. 

■  Be concise and tactful. 

■  Break up the text by using short lines and paragraphs; this makes it easier to read. 

■  Do not write in UPPERCASE or bold, which may be perceived as shouting or telling off the 

recipient. 

■  Copyright laws apply to electronic mail as well as printed media. 

■  Respond promptly to email messages – even if it is just to let the sender know that you will 

reply in full later. 

Remember that all laws that apply to discrimination, defamation and harassment (verbal, emotional 
and sexual) also apply to electronic communication.

National Induction Program 
Program outline 

Introduction 

The National Training and Education Unit (NTEU) has developed a National Induction Program (the 
program) that is designed to ensure that staff who are new to the agency or gain a promotion at an 
identified level, receive a nationally consistent induction to the AEC. The program is designed to set 
clear expectations regarding the roles and responsibilities of Participants and the agency, and it will 
guide the performance and professional development of all staff, laying the foundations of the AEC’s 
working environment, agency values and agency expectations. 

Learning outcomes 

By the end of the program Participants will be able to: 

1.  Behave in accordance with the AEC values and commitments, and describe why they 

underpin the work of the AEC. 

2.  Make decisions and demonstrate behaviours that represent the APS values and comply with 

the APS Code of Conduct. 

3.  Promote and contribute to a positive organisational culture based on quality, agility and 

professionalism. 

4.  Apply learning to role that is compliant with policies, procedures and legislation relevant to the 

AEC. 

5.  Recognise the importance of transparency in the AEC and its impact on reputation and public 

perception. 

6.  Identify how their role contributes to AEC business outcomes and agency objectives. 
7.  Identify the internal and external factors of the AEC’s environment and consider them when 

performing their role. 

8.  Explain the role of Parliament, the role the AEC plays in its formation and the importance of 

political neutrality. 

9.  Explain the guiding principles of electoral management and the three levels of government in 

Australia.

Program Design 

The program is split across three (3) phases with modules and resources provided to support each 
phase. The program is designed to be delivered to a Participant over a period of five months and will 
commence from two weeks prior to starting their role. 

Phase 

Timing

Review 

Module 9 

6 months 

The Participant will have actioned all 
necessary recruitment activities and have an 
understanding of the agency’s role and 
expectations of staff and self. 

The Line Manager has completed required 
activities to ensure smooth transition on Day 
one.  

The Participant and identified key staff 
involved in program delivery have successfully 
understood and participated in assigned 
induction modules, including on the job 
training, and are confident that future activities 
will be actioned in accordance with the AEC 
values and expectations. 

The Participant and the Line Manager have 
had meaningful discussion at all ‘Check-in 
Points’ throughout the program. 

The Line Manager and Executive Level Officer 
are confident that the programs overall 
learning outcomes have been met. 

Observation of learning in action continues. 
Feedback has been provided to the NTEU for 
further program development and updates.  

Participation 

The Participant group for the program will be staff that gain an ongoing or non-ongoing role within the 
AEC at the following levels: 

  APS2-APS6 

  Executive Level (EL) 

  Senior Executive Services (SES) 

Where AEC staff gain promotion, they will not be required to participate in the full program, but 
should review the modules in consultation with their manager, and undertake identified compulsory 
activities e.g. the AEC Foundation Programs. 

For staff who gain a non-ongoing role within the AEC, they will be required to participate in the 
program up until the point in which their contract expires. If a staff member leaves the AEC at the 
conclusion of their contract and then returns within a six month period, they will be expected to 
continue working through the program until it is completed.


--- Page 3 ---

The Program will require the identification of the following staff to support program delivery: 

  Line Manager - the responsible officer that will conduct the induction locally and either 

undertake or delegate induction activities. The Line Manager will also be responsible for 
providing feedback on performance. 

  Local Induction Adviser - will help the Participant settle in and act as their primary contact on 

general enquiries and day to day operational issues. 

  Executive Level Officer – through consultation with the Line Manager, they will ensure that 
expectations of the program are being met, that mandatory training is being completed and 
that the Participant is fit for the organisation prior to the probation period end date (where 
applicable). 

  Local Trainers - taken from the AEC’s assessed trainer pool, they may be responsible for 

delivery of face to face session content for Participants in their office/state/branch or in other 
locations, where required. 

  NTEU – will deliver face to face sessions to Participants in Canberra, including any relevant 

delivery to National Office branches.  

Roles and responsibilities for identified staff are clearly outlined in the resources developed for the 
program. 

Curriculum 

The program is designed to provide the Participant with consistent guidance and an understanding of 
the agency’s values, expected behaviours, corporate and operating environment, agency direction 
and purpose. 

Specific information on the Participant’s job role, will be driven by their level and area of the 
organisation, and is accounted for under a capability framework and specific job role requirements. 
These critical infrastructure pieces are being developed in parallel to the induction program. 

A set curriculum has been developed for the program outlining subject matter and staff involvement. 
The curriculum provides visibility to all staff involved in the program about what will be discussed 
throughout the five months. 

The program aligns with other AEC timeframes and requirements including the development of 
Individual Performance Plans (IPPs), probationary reporting and the completion of mandatory 
training. The program will direct the Participant and the Line Manager to the existing resources 
available in these areas. 

The curriculum features a two day AEC Foundation Program – National Experience in Canberra for 
those staff at the APS6 – SES level and a one day Network Experience conducted in the states for 
those staff at the APS2 – APS5 level. These programs are designed to support the Participant in 
meeting the learning outcomes and provide an opportunity for the Participant to build their peer 
networks. Programs will be conducted twice annually with some travel required for identified staff. 

NOTE: As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the inaugural programs will be delivered as a virtual 
facilitator led experience. The AEC Foundation Program – National Experience will be held virtually 
over a two week period, and the Network Experience will be held virtually over a one week period. 
Once COVID-19 restrictions are eased, the AEC will review the Foundation Programs. 

See Attachment A for an overview of the program curriculum. 

Resources 

A series of induction modules have been developed by the NTEU to ensure that delivery of the 
program is nationally consistent, professional and in line with the curriculum and learning outcomes.


--- Page 4 ---

Modules are available to identified staff through a dedicated National Induction Program SharePoint 
page located on the Learning Hub. Through the Learning Hub staff will be able to access the 
following materials: 

  Manager Guides - each module will feature a Manager Guide that will provide the Line 

Manager and the Local Induction Adviser with information and resources to support topics 
being discussed and undertaken at that time. 

  Checklists – each module will have a Checklist that will work in conjunction with the Manager 

Guide to ensure that Line Managers, the Local Induction Adviser and the Participant 
undertake their required actions. 

  Participant Guides – identified modules will feature a Participant Guide that will provide the 

Participant with additional reading and required actions to support their learning. 

  Resources – each module will have assigned resources including scenarios, case studies, 
templates and activities to support the delivery of the program and ensure consistency. 

 

 

Induction eLearning course – an induction eLearning course has been developed allowing the 
Participant to gain an initial understanding of the AEC’s working environment, including the 
AEC values and expectations. 

Induction videos – a series of short videos have been recorded by members of the Executive 
Leadership Team introducing themselves, welcoming the Participant to the agency and 
promoting specific key information e.g. the AEC Corporate Plan, strategic direction and their 
expectations of staff. 

Additional program resources including staff roles and responsibilities have been developed, as well 
as facilitator guides and facilitator resources for the AEC Foundation Program – National and 
Network Experience. 

Consultation 

The NTEU reviewed current AEC content against the program objectives, identifying gaps in 
resources and engaging with business owners in content development. The NTEU designed and 
developed materials to support the program, and business owners were consulted and reviewed all 
module content and eLearning as required. 

The Learning and Development Community of Practice supported the program through testing, which 
ensured the program was fit for purpose and user friendly. 

Feedback has been discussed throughout the consultation phase and changes have been made to 
the program as required. 

All identified staff who participate in the program are required to provide feedback and undertake an 
evaluation of the program upon completion of each module.</pre>

National Induction Program  
Roles and Responsibilities 

Participant 

Completion of the National Induction Program is a requirement as part of the Participant’s 
introduction to the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) and Australian Public Service (APS) and 
must be prioritised. 

Participants are ongoing or non-ongoing staff that are new to the agency, or who gain promotion at 
an identified level. 

The National Induction Program is designed for APS2 – SES level staff only, APS1 and staff 
identified to fill key election specific roles are outside scope for this program. 

Line Manager 

The Line Manager will be the responsible officer that conducts the National Induction Program 
locally. The Line Manager will either action or delegate induction activities, and provide feedback on 
performance that is in line with the Australian Electoral Commission’s (AEC’s) Performance 
Management Program and Probation Policy.  

In some instances the Line Manager may not be located in the same office as the Participant  
e.g. Participant is an APS6 in a stand-alone office and their Line Manager is an Operations Manager 
in the State Office. The Line Manager will: 

■  provide one on one training and support for the Participant on AEC specific information 

■  use and refer the Participant to approved AEC policies and procedures only 

■  ensure they are familiar with all training content prior to actioning each module 

■  be available to the Participant, responding to questions as needed, ensuring the Participant 

feels comfortable to seek support 

■ 

■ 

follow all instructions contained in the National Induction Program modules, including guides 
and resources, ensuring a nationally consistent program is delivered 

incorporate ‘why, how and when’ questions into one on one training to encourage the 
Participant to think about how activities are linked to their role or work area/branch 

■  delegate induction activities if required, unless indicated in the program as Line Manager 

specific e.g. Individual Performance Plans (IPPs) 

■  meet with the Participant at all assigned ‘Check-in Points’ throughout the induction and 

discuss role, performance and fit 

■  meet with the Participant within the first four weeks of employment to discuss and set up an 

IPP 

■ 

follow all guidance in relation to providing the Participant with feedback on their progress and 
other information that will support their development


--- Page 2 ---

■  ensure they maintain Participant records in ObjectiveIM, in accordance with local ObjectiveIM 
conventions, and provide examples to the Participant at all Check-in Points, probationary 
period discussions and/or IPP discussions 

■  provide timely feedback to the Participant and provide evidence and/or examples to support 

the feedback 

■  conduct themselves in a professional manner, supporting the AEC’s values and commitments 

throughout the induction period and beyond 

■  behave in accordance with the APS values and code of conduct 

■  provide feedback on the National Induction Program to the National Training and Education 

Unit (NTEU) upon completion of each module 

■ 

refrain from voicing personal opinion on AEC policies, procedures and/or stakeholders during 
delivery 

■  monitor the Participant’s progress, and ensure that all modules and associated activities are 

marked as completed during the timeframes provided. 

Line Managers must complete all Manager Guides in alignment with the relevant module checklists 
to ensure all key information is discussed. Line Managers are reminded that they must give the 
National Induction Program and its resources ample attention to ensure that staff are set up for 
success in the AEC. 

Local Induction Adviser 

The Local Induction Adviser will be a locally based officer identified by the Line Manager and will be 
responsible for supporting the Participant in their first five months with the Australian Electoral 
Commission (AEC). 

The Local Induction Adviser must have the skills and knowledge to support the Participant throughout 
the National Induction Program, and is a voluntary role. Where the Local Induction Adviser believes 
that they do not have the appropriate skills and knowledge to undertake this task, they must discuss 
this with their Line Manager immediately. 

The identified Local Induction Adviser will assist the Participant in developing a positive workplace 
culture by ensuring they feel welcomed, helping them settle in and acting as the Participant’s primary 
contact on general enquiries and day to day operational issues. The Local Induction Adviser will: 

■  provide one on one training and support for the Participant on role specific activities that are in 

line with AEC procedures and legislation 

■ 

■ 

incorporate ‘why, how and when’ questions into one on one training to encourage the 
Participant to think about how activities are linked to their role or work area/branch 

follow all instructions contained in the National Induction Program modules, including guides 
and resources, ensuring a nationally consistent program is delivered 

■  use and refer the Participant to approved AEC policies and procedures only 

■  answer role specific and general enquiries questions only, escalating all other questions to 
their Line Manager, or directing the Participant to seek a response from their Line Manager 

■  be available to the Participant, responding to role specific questions as needed, ensuring the 

Participant feels comfortable to seek support


--- Page 3 ---

■  conduct themselves in a professional manner, supporting the AEC’s values and commitments 

throughout the induction period and beyond 

■ 

refrain from voicing personal opinion or engaging in office politics with the Participant 

■  behave in accordance with the APS values and code of conduct 

■  notify the Line Manager of training completion against the national induction timeline, and any 
actions that may impact the Participant’s ability to complete activities against the timeline i.e. 
sickness/absenteeism 

■  provide Line Managers with timely feedback on how the Participant is progressing and 

provide evidence and/or examples to support the feedback 

■  provide timely feedback to the Participant where it is identified that incorrect action/process 

has or is about to be undertaken, and explain correct course of action/process 

■  provide feedback on the National Induction Program to their Line Manager and the National 

Training and Education Unit (NTEU) upon completion of each module. 

When selecting a Local Induction Adviser, the Line Manager should look for staff that have: 

■  good communication skills including the ability to listen 

■  good time management and self-management skills so that they can be available to the 

Participant 

■  a demonstrated ability to comply with the AEC’s policies and procedures, including the 

experience to be able to provide the right level of support 

■  a demonstrated history of strong performance 

■  an honest and considerate approach when it comes to providing feedback. 

The Local Induction Adviser is not responsible for any performance management, this will be the 
responsibility of the Line Manager only. Queries regarding performance, disciplinary action, or policy 
matters must be directed to the Line Manager. 

Executive Level Officer 

The Line Manager’s assigned Executive Level Officer must be engaged to ensure that expectations 
of the National Induction Program and the Participant are being met, that mandatory training is being 
completed and that the Participant is fit for the AEC prior to the probation period end date. 

The Executive Level Officer will not participate in the learning and development of the Participant 
(unless the Participant is their direct report) but will be available to the Line Manager as needed. 

The Executive Level Officer may meet with the Participant on their first day, either face to face or via 
skype, to discuss values and expectations of the agency and their state/branch. Meetings will be 
dependent on the Executive Level Officer’s time, other scheduled meetings and Participant role.

Information about current and former AEC employees 

■  Personal information about electors

AEC contact telephone numbers  
The AEC has several telephone numbers as outlined below. The AEC switchboard is the 
responsibility of the Parliamentary and Party Registration section in NO. 

■  13 23 26 – This is the generic telephone number for the AEC’s divisional offices and is 

used on all public advertising and listings. Most calls to this phone number will be diverted 
to a divisional office after the caller enters their postcode. Where a caller does not enter a 
postcode, the call is diverted to their state office. All calls to this number from within 
Australia are the cost of a local call. Overseas callers cannot dial this number. 

■  +61 2 6160 2600 – This number is advertised on our website specifically for people who 
are calling from overseas. This directs people to enter the postcode for their enrolled 
address. Their call is then diverted to the relevant divisional office, based on the postcode 
they enter. If no postcode is entered, the call is diverted to the National Office switchboard 
number, below. 
(02) 6271 4411 – AEC switchboard in National Office. This number is published on our 
website along with our state office switchboard numbers. 
Interpreter calls – This is a service where non-English speaking callers can have a three-
way conversation with the AEC, assisted by an interpreter in their own language. Further 
information on this service is available below.  

■ 

■ 

■  10 Mort St – Security Guards – 

Hours of operation 
The switchboard responds to incoming calls received from the general public as follows: 

■  Non-election hours of operation – 9am to 5pm (Monday to Friday) 

During a federal election, the switchboard is diverted to the AECs escalation cell and the INFO 
and Complaints mailboxes are diverted to the AEC’s Election Contact Centre.

PECT is the AECs official system to record and escalate enquiries and complaints. 

All AEC staff are required to enter all public enquiries, feedback and complaints received. The

recorded separately. Due to the volume of email enquiries we receive, the Public Engagement 
team is required to enter into PECT all phone calls and emailed complaints only. If a complaint 
needs to be escalated to another business area or division, it must be done through PECT. The 
exceptions are legal enquiries and complaints – these are to be forwarded via email to the Legal 
Mailbox, marked ‘Official’.

message explaining it is an interpreter call and to press zero (0) to accept the call.   

Always accept interpreter calls. There is also a range of translated information on our website in 
more than 30 languages. Please let the caller know this information is available and offer to email 
or mail this information to them, as they may have trouble navigating our website, which is written 
in English. 

Invoices from Interpreter companies 
Although we have a contract in place with LanguageLoop, we also accept calls made via Home 
Affairs’ TIS. A Spending Approval form must be completed at the start of each financial year for 
Tis if we decide to keep accepting interpreter calls from them. This is signed off by the relevant 
branch delegate, usually our Director.  

At the start of each month, we receive invoices in the Public Engagement mailbox from both 
companies. We also receive a monthly report spreadsheet of itemised calls from Vits in the first 
week of each month.  Please check the itemised list of calls is correct, as per the instructions 
below, before approving any public spending. Once you have approved them, complete and code 
the invoices and send a copy of the Vits account to Accounts to be paid. The Tis invoice is paid 
by credit card. Provide the codes and send them, along with the invoice to 
pay it via credit card. A copy of both invoices is kept in the white folder on

Tis invoices: Check that the phone number for each call is 13 23 26 because calls for other 
electoral commissions occasionally slip through onto our account. The only phone number we 
have approved for Tis to use is 13 23 26. If there are any discrepancies, you must contact Tis 
and have the charges reversed. For the financial year, you must ensure you keep a tally of the 
amount spent to ensure it does not exceed the spending approval amount. This is always kept in 
the white folder on

National Relay Service 
The National Relay Service (NRS) is a telephone service for people who are deaf or have a 
hearing or speech impairment.  It is a government initiative managed through the Australian 
Communications and Media Authority (ACMA). People are able to call the AEC via the NRS to 
facilitate the conversation. 

When you receive an NRS-facilitated call, the relay officer will announce the call to you, such as, 
‘Hello, I have a call for the AEC from the National Relay Service. I have [caller’s name] on the 
line. Please go ahead’.   

You may find that there is a short delay as the relay officer uses their keyboard to type your 
response to the caller and the caller types to the NRS in return. You may hear the relay officer on 
the line, or in some cases, the caller themselves.  

During the call, it may be useful to say ‘Go ahead’ when you have finished speaking. We do not 
receive invoices for this service. It is a government initiative open to anyone to use. 

Recorded messages for switchboard 
Callers who ring the National Office switchboard number (02 6271 4411) outside our business 
hours (9-5pm) will hear a pre-recorded message providing them with information regarding our 
hours of operation.

It is our responsibility to record these messages when they require changing. Prior to each ACT 
public holiday and the Christmas shutdown period, you will need to ensure this is done. See 
Appendix D for detailed instructions on recording voicemail messages. See Appendix C for a full 
transcript of each recorded message. 

Recorded message (IVR) for 13 23 26 number 
This is the recorded message on the 13 number. Outside of a federal election, there are 
occasions where you may wish to update this and put a diversion in place. To have the message 
changed, you must either email the AEC’s telephony section in IT with a request, or submit an IT 
request form with the details. Often you will need to provide a week’s notice. Always check it has 
gone through by ringing the 13 number.

At the start of each year, the previous year’s content must be moved into the folder titled 
‘Archived Data’. This includes all the sent emails for the previous year. You can do this yourself 
or ask IT Support for assistance. If you are archiving 2020 data for example, a new folder needs 
to be created under 2020 titled ‘Sent’. All emails from the INFO sent folder must be moved into 
this folder. This makes searching for a sent email a lot faster. This also means at the start of each 
year, the INFO sent folder will be empty. 

INFO Personal Message Manager (PMM) 
The PMM is a SPAM (junk mail) filter. This works in the background to filter out any incoming 
emails which the AEC IT system thinks may be junk or malicious.  

Each afternoon at 3pm, you will usually receive an email from pmm@aec.gov.au. It contains a 
link for you to check any emails which the system has deemed to be possible spam or malicious. 
You must check the spam for each of the three shared mailboxes each day. Also check your 
personal mailbox.  

To add the shared mailboxes to your spam filter, refer to the image below. Select the ‘Options’ 
tab in the blue toolbar at the top of the page, then select ‘new’. 

Enter the shared mailbox address and select OK.

Appendix A 

Incoming calls 
It is important to determine the nature of all calls as a first step. 

  The switchboard number receives a fair number of marketing and sales calls. These are 

not to be transferred to staff.  

  You may not confirm any of the following information to a caller: whether a person works 
for the AEC, a person’s work number, a person’s email address, or the format of AEC 
email addresses  - e.g. 

Calls for Senior Executive Staff (Assistant Commissioners and above).  

  Do not transfer calls from members of the public. Take a message. You could say, “I 
cannot transfer your call to the Electoral Commissioner, but I can take a message and 
pass it to her/his office for action.” 

 

If the caller identifies themselves as a member or senator, executive office holder 
(President, Vice-President, Secretary) of a major political party, or a person from 
another Government Agency, contact the relevant Executive Assistant in the 
Executive Area (for a member of ELT) or Branch Project Officer to discuss. 

Transferring a call to an internal number 
To transfer a call to an internal extension number: 

■  When you answer a call, your telephone screen will display a button marked ‘Transfer’. 

Press the button. 

■  Dial the extension number.  
■  Wait for the ring tone. 
■  Speak to the EA and provide them with the caller details. 
■ 
■  The call is now transferred. 

If they choose to accept the call, press the button marked ‘Transfer’ again and hang up. 

Transferring a call 
If the call is for an AEC help desk, there is no need to announce the caller before transferring the 
call. Calls to individual staff can be pre-announced. 

■  Press the button marked ‘Transfer’ 
■  Dial the extension number

Appendix B 

How to record new messages 
We have three different pre-recorded messages for the Switchboard phone: One for standard 
business hours, one for public holidays and one for an emergency. You can also forward the 
switchboard phone to another area within the AEC if needed. 

These messages are recorded by us. 

Standard Business Hours 
A recorded message is automatically activated each working day. Calls will come through to the 
Switchboard from 9am each business day until 5pm when callers will receive a message to say 
we are closed. Provided standard business hours don’t change, you will not need to record a 
message for this service. 

At election time, calls go directly to the call centre. As the call centre has extended hours, there is 
no need to record another message. When the call centre is closed, callers will hear our standard 
business hours message. 

Public Holidays  
On public holidays a message needs to be recorded to advise callers we are closed. The 
messages to use are provided below. See Appendix E – Changing the recording on the 
Switchboard phone. 

Emergency  
The emergency message is used in the event there is an emergency and it is safe for you to 
record a new message.

APPENDIX F 

Compiling the Complaints Management Report 

Timing 
A quarterly report is produced about 8 - 10 days into the next month. This allows for most 
complaints or enquiries for the previous month to be resolved, meaning data entered in the report 
will be more accurate.  

Distributing the Report 
The Report is to be distributed through the Senior Parliamentary Officer, DAE Branch to the 
Organisational Health Committee (OHC) Secretariat, state/territory managers and First Assistant 
Commissioners  

The Report will then be considered at the monthly OHC meeting on the second Wednesday of 
that month. 

Data for the Report 

1.  Extract the data from the Public Engagement Contact Tool (PECT) as an Excel 

spreadsheet. 

a.  A quick link to PECT is available from the AEC Intranet homepage – see below.

The Electoral Commissioner is an \n\"Agency Head\" for the purposes of the Act (paragraph 29(2)(b) of the \nCommonwealth Electoral Act 1918). \n\nApplication \n1. Application of the Procedures \n1.1  The Procedures apply in determining whether an APS employee, has breached the Code in \n\nsection 13 of the Act.  \n\n1.2    In these Procedures, unless the contrary intention appears, a reference to: \n\na)  an APS employee includes reference to a former APS employee who is suspected of \n\nhaving breached the Code while an employee in the AEC; and  \n\nb)  a breach of the Code by a person includes a reference to a person engaging in conduct \n\nset out in subsection 15(2A) of the Act in connection with their engagement as an APS \n\nemployee. \n\n1.3. In accordance with subsection 15(7) of the Act, these procedures are publicly available on the \n\nAEC\u2019s website. \n\nNote:   The Procedures apply only in relation to a suspected breach of the Code by an APS employee \n\nin respect of which a determination is to be made. Not all suspected breaches of the Code \nmay need to be dealt with by way of a determination. In particular circumstances, another \nway of dealing with a suspected breach of the Code may be more appropriate. \n\nThese Procedures are not legislative instruments (see subsection 15(8) of the Act).  \n\n2\n\n\n--- Page 4 ---\n\nPrinciples   \n2       Who may determine a breach of the Code and impose a sanction \nNote: \n\n Clause 40 of the Australian Public Service Commissioner\u2019s Directions 2016 provides that where the \nconduct of an APS employee raises concerns that relate both to effective performance and possible \nbreaches of the Code, the Agency Head must, before making a decision to deal with a suspected \nbreach under the formal misconduct provisions (being these Procedures), have regard to any relevant \nstandards and guidance issued by the Australian Public Service Commissioner.  \n\nInvestigations of suspected misconduct by former employees can be undertaken, but sanctions cannot \nbe imposed on former employees. \n\n2.1 \n\nAs soon as practicable after a suspected breach of the Code has been identified, the \nElectoral Commissioner or the Deputy Electoral Commissioner may deal with a suspected \nbreach, in accordance with the Procedures, by: \n\na)  making a written determination whether the APS employee has breached the Code; or \n\nb)  selecting the person  to make a determination whether the APS employee has breached \n\nthe Code (the breach decision maker).  \n\nNote: \n\nThe Australian Public Service Commissioner\u2019s prior written consent is required if a non APS \nemployee will be selected as the breach decision maker / sanction delegate (subsection 78(8) \nof the Act).  \n\nAn internal or external investigator may be appointed by the breach decision maker to \ninvestigate the alleged breach, gather evidence and present a report of factual findings, \nincluding recommendations.  \n\nThe person making the decision on the sanction must hold a delegation under the Act to do \nso (the sanction delegate). \n\nNote: These Procedures do not prevent the breach decision maker from being the sanction decision \nmaker in the same matter. \n\nSubject to clause 2.3 above, these procedures do not prevent the breach decision maker \nfrom being the sanction delegate in the same matter. \n\nThe Australian Public Service Commission publication \u2018Handling Misconduct Managers Guide \n\u2019, is a recommended resource available to the Breach Decision Maker and Sanction Delegate, \nto support them in making the determination and sanction decision.  \n\nDetermination process \nThe process for determining whether an APS employee has breached the Code must be \ncarried out with as little formality, and with as much expedition, as a proper consideration of \nthe matter allows. \n\nThe process must be consistent with the principles of procedural fairness. \n\nA formal hearing is not required in order for a person to determine whether an APS \nemployee has breached the Code. \n\nInformation to be given to employee before a determination is made \nA determination may not be made in relation to a suspected breach of the Code by an APS \nemployee unless reasonable steps have been taken to inform the employee of: \n\n2.2 \n\n2.3 \n\n2.4 \n\n2.5 \n\n3 \n3.1 \n\n3.2 \n\n3.3 \n\n4 \n4.1 \n\n3\n\n\n--- Page 5 ---\n\na)  the details of the suspected breach of the Code including any variation of those details; \n\nand \n\nb)  the sanctions that may be imposed on the employee under subsection 15(1) of the Act. \n\n4.2 \n\nA person who is making a determination in relation to a suspected breach of the Code by an \nAPS employee must give that employee a reasonable opportunity to make an oral and/or \nwritten statement, in relation to the suspected breach.  This statement may be made to the \nBreach Decision Maker or to the appointed investigator: \n\na)  within seven days of the APS employee being informed of the details (or any variation of \n\nthose details) of the suspected breach; or \n\nb)  such longer period as is allowed.  \n\n4.3 \n\n4.4 \n\n5 \n\n5.1 \n\n5.2 \n\n6 \n6.1 \n\n6.2 \n\n6.3 \n\n6.4 \n\nAn APS employee who does not make a statement in relation to the suspected breach is not, \nonly for that reason, to be taken to have admitted committing the suspected breach. \n\nThe breach decision maker or the investigator may agree to a request made by the APS \nemployee who is suspected of breaching the Code to have a support person present in a \nmeeting or interview they conduct.  The support person cannot speak or advocate on the \nemployees behalf. \n\nPersons involved in making a determination or imposing a sanction to be \nindependent and unbiased \nThe breach decision maker, any investigator assisting the breach decision maker and the \nsanction delegate must be, and must appear to be, independent and unbiased. \n\nA person must not determine whether an APS employee has breached the Code if the \nperson has previously made a report in relation to all or any matter suspected of \nconstituting the breach by the employee. \n\nSanctions \nIf a determination is made that an APS employee has breached the Code, the APS employee \nmay be subject to the imposition of a sanction under section 15 of the Act. \n\nSanctions are intended to be proportionate to the nature of the breach, and provide a clear \nmessage to the relevant employee that their behaviour was unacceptable. \n\nThe process for deciding on sanction must be consistent with the principles of procedural \nfairness. \n\nIf a determination is made that an APS employee has breached the Code, a sanction may not \nbe imposed on the employee unless reasonable steps have been taken to: \n\na) \n\ninform the APS employee of: \n\ni. \n\nii. \n\niii. \n\nthe determination that has been made; \n\nthe sanction or sanctions that are under consideration; and \n\nthe factors that are under consideration in determining any sanction to be \n\nimposed; and \n\n4\n\n\n--- Page 6 ---\n\nb)  give the APS employee a reasonable opportunity to make a written statement in relation \n\nto the sanction or sanctions under consideration within 7 calendar days, or any longer \n\nperiod that is allowed by the sanction delegate. \n\nNote:   The sanction delegate may decide to give the employee the opportunity to make both a \n\nwritten and an oral statement. \n\n7 \n7.1 \n\nRecord of determination and sanction \nIf a determination is made in relation to a suspected breach of the Code by an APS \nemployee, a written record must be made of: \n\na)  the suspected breach; and  \n\nb)  the determination; and  \n\nc)  any sanctions imposed as a result of a determination that the employee breached the \n\nCode; and \n\nd)  if a statement of reasons was given to the employee \u2013 the statement of reasons.  \n\nNote:   The Archives Act 1983 and the Privacy Act 1988 apply to a record made under this clause. \n\n8 \n8.1 \n\nProcedures where basis of engagement in the AEC changes or ends \nThis clause applies where an APS employee is suspected of having breached the Code and a \ndetermination has not been made in relation to the suspected breach before: \n\na)  the basis of the employee's engagement in the AEC changes; or \n\nb)  the employee moves to another Agency, \n\nNote:   Examples of a change in the basis of an APS employee's engagement in an Agency are as follows: \n\na)  a change from engagement for a specified term, or for the duration of a specified task, to \n\nengagement as an ongoing APS employee; \n\nb)  a change from engagement for duties that are irregular or intermittent to engagement as an \n\nongoing APS employee. \n\n8.2 \n\nIf the basis of the APS employee's engagement in the AEC has changed before a \ndetermination is made in relation to the suspected breach, the determination must be made \nin accordance with the procedures applicable to the basis of the employee's engagement in \nthe AEC at the time the process for determining whether the employee has breached the \nCode is commenced. \n\n8.3 \n\nMovements (including promotions) will not take effect until the matter is resolved, unless \nboth Agency Heads agree otherwise. \n\nNote: The matter is taken to be resolved when: \n\na)  a determination is made;

Engagement is subject to the AEC being satisfied that employees are of suitable character to be \nemployed in the Australian Public Service (APS). Your engagement is subject to the passing of a \ncharacter assessment, including a nationally coordinated criminal history check (police check). The \nAEC currently uses Equifax Australia Pty Ltd, an authorised agent of the Australian Criminal \nIntelligence Commission (ACIC), for the processing of these police checks, through the Fit2Work \nportal.

The AEC must maintain strict political neutrality and cannot employ anyone who publicly engages in \npolitical activities or who intends to do so, or where there is a perception that the person is involved \nwith such activity. \n\n1.10.  Should a situation arise during your employment where you wish to publicly engage in political \n\nactivities, or where there may be a perception that you are involved in political activities, you must \nimmediately discuss the matter with your manager.

Engagement is subject to the condition that the information you provide to the AEC is not false or \n\nmisleading. This includes, but is not limited to, supplying the AEC with false or misleading information \nduring the recruitment and engagement process. \n\nAPS Values and Code of Conduct \n\n1.16.

In accordance with subsection 29(1) of the PS Act you will be provided written notice that your offer of \n\nemployment has been withdrawn or your employment terminated. \n\nReasonable Adjustment Support \n\n1.23.

It provides information, tips and \nexpectations for APS1s in their role with the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC).  \n\nA list of training can be found at Attachment A and a list of resources is located at Attachment B of \nthis booklet. \n\nThe audience for this document is all APS1s. \n\n Page 3 \n\nAPS1 Induction and training booklet\n\n\n--- Page 5 ---\n\nAbout the AEC \n\nThe AEC\u2019s purpose \n\nThe Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) is an independent statutory authority established by the \nAustralian Government and our purpose is to: \n\nMaintain an impartial and independent electoral system for eligible voters through active \nelectoral roll management, efficient delivery of polling services and targeted education \nand public awareness programs \n\nWe do this by: \n\n\u25a0  ensuring confidence in the Commonwealth electoral roll \n\n\u25a0  conducting successful electoral events, including federal elections, by-elections, \n\nreferendums and industrial elections and ballots \n\n\u25a0  undertaking public awareness activities \n\n\u25a0 \n\nregulating political party registrations and financial disclosure \n\n\u25a0  supporting electoral redistributions1. \n\nStructure of the AEC \n\nThree tier structure \n\nThe AEC has a three-tier structure: \n\n\u25a0  a national office in Canberra \n\n\u25a0  state and territory offices, and \n\n\u25a0  divisional offices. \n\nNational office \n\nThere are three divisions in the national office \u2013 the Service Delivery Division, the Enabling and \nRegulation Division and the Organisational Transformation Division \u2013 headed by the agency's three \nfirst assistant commissioners. The First Assistant Commissioner, Service Delivery Division is the \nNational Election Manager. \n\n1 AEC Corporate Plan 2021-22: https://www.aec.gov.au/About_AEC/Publications/corporate-plan/index.htm  \n\n Page 4 \n\nAPS1 Induction and training booklet\n\n\n--- Page 6 ---\n\nState offices \n\nState offices are located in each state capital. The Northern Territory office is in Darwin. The \nAustralian Capital Territory (ACT) is managed by the NSW State Manager except during election \nperiods, when an Australian Electoral Officer (AEO) for the ACT is appointed. \n\nDivisional offices \n\nDivisional offices are responsible for electoral administration within each electoral division, which \nincludes the conduct of elections, management of the electoral roll and carrying out public awareness \nactivities. Some divisions are located in a standalone office, while others are co-located with other \ndivisions and operate as larger work units. \n\nElectoral divisions are also known as electorates. There are 151 electoral divisions in Australia, and \neach electoral division is represented by a member of the House of Representatives.  \n\nThe AEC values and commitments \n\nThe AEC\u2019s values of electoral integrity through quality, agility and professionalism, supported by the \norganisational commitment to the ballot paper principles and every task matters principle, were first \nintroduced in February 2015. \n\nSince then, the AEC values and commitments have been a fundamental part of the AEC; forming a \nvalues and behaviours framework that has underpinned everything the AEC does as individuals and \nas an organisation. \n\nDefining the AEC values \n\nEach value has been defined to support all staff in having a common understanding of what each \nvalue means. The definition for each value is written as a \u2018We statement\u2019 to reflect its connection to \nthe AEC\u2019s purpose and vision: \n\nOur purpose is to maintain an impartial and independent electoral system for eligible voters \nthrough active electoral roll management, efficient delivery of polling services, and targeted \neducation and public awareness programs. \n\nOur vision \u2013 We are a leader in refining and delivering best practice in election management. \n\nThe definitions are supported by I statements that provide examples of what each value looks like in \naction (i.e. a guide of the behaviours expected of AEC staff). These statements will help staff identify \nand promote behaviours around the workplace that demonstrate Electoral \nIntegrity through Professionalism, Agility, and Quality. \n\nA spotlight on each value, can be found on the AEC values launch page on the Intranet. \n\nElectoral integrity \n\nWe provide electoral services to deliver the franchise \n\nWe are neutral, transparent, and accountable in the preparation and conduct of electoral processes \n\nWe provide voters and stakeholders with confidence in the conduct and result of an election \n\nWhat does this look like in the AEC? \n\n\u25a0 \n\n\u25a0 \n\n Page 5 \n\nI maintain political neutrality and impartiality \n\nI respect and protect the privacy of an elector\u2019s personal information \n\nAPS1 Induction and training booklet\n\n\n--- Page 7 ---\n\n\u25a0 \n\n\u25a0 \n\n\u25a0 \n\n\u25a0 \n\n\u25a0 \n\nI uphold the integrity of the electoral roll at all times \n\nI uphold the sanctity of the ballot paper in all its forms and at all times \n\nI provide accurate information to stakeholders and work to correct any misunderstanding that \nmay occur \n\nI ensure my actions reflect positively on the reputation of the AEC \n\nI consider the integrity of electoral process in every task and how my conduct can impact the \nintegrity of the election \n\n\u25a0 \n\nI follow policies and procedures to support delivery of tasks related to elections administration \n\nQuality \n\nWe maintain the highest possible standards and continue to improve upon best practice while \nconsidering the needs of our users, stakeholders and clients \n\nWe understand that no matter how small a task is, it has the potential to impact the reputation of the \nAEC, our stakeholders, and electors \n\nWhat does this look like in the AEC? \n\n\u25a0 \n\n\u25a0 \n\n\u25a0 \n\n\u25a0 \n\n\u25a0 \n\n\u25a0 \n\nI commit to consistently achieving the highest standard of work \n\nI ensure the information and advice I provide is accurate and timely \n\nI am aware that no matter how small or insignificant a task appears to be, it has the potential \nto impact the AEC, our stakeholders, and our customers \n\nI respond positively and constructively to feedback and guidance on my performance \n\nI acknowledge that robust and transparent information management drives quality business \noutcomes \n\nI collect, use and disclose personal information in strict compliance with the Australian Privacy \nPrinciples \n\nAgility \n\nWe embrace and respond positively to the dynamic and complex environment in which we operate \n\nWe will anticipate, adapt and respond to change and welcome new ways of working. \n\nWhat does this look like in the AEC? \n\n\u25a0 \n\n\u25a0 \n\n\u25a0 \n\n\u25a0 \n\n\u25a0 \n\n\u25a0 \n\n\u25a0 \n\nI adapt and respond to change and ask for help when it is needed. \n\nI stay calm and focused when working under pressure and in difficult situations. \n\nI provide workable solutions to solve immediate problems and I identify and escalate more \ncomplex problems that may impact on my tasks \n\nI maintain an awareness of the work of other business areas and adapt to changing priorities \nas required. \n\nI share my knowledge and information with team members and staff \n\nI work collaboratively with teams on shared problems and initiatives \n\nI identify lessons to be learned or opportunities for innovation in my work \n\n Page 6 \n\nAPS1 Induction and training booklet\n\n\n--- Page 8 ---\n\nProfessionalism \n\nWe deliver our work to the highest standards, using our knowledge and skills to provide excellent \nservice in all areas of our work \n\nWe continue to develop a high performing, capable and responsive AEC workforce \n\nWe show respect and courtesy to our colleagues and to our stakeholders \n\nWhat does this look like in the AEC? \n\n\u25a0 \n\n\u25a0 \n\n\u25a0 \n\n\u25a0 \n\n\u25a0 \n\n\u25a0 \n\n\u25a0 \n\nI conduct myself in a cordial and respectful manner with colleagues, customers and \nstakeholders at all times. \n\nI respond and anticipate client needs in a timely, professional and helpful matter. \n\nI keep up to date with information and new processes relevant to my role.

It is \ncritical that staff follow all AEC procedures at all times; delivering high quality electoral events that \nare transparent and uphold the AEC\u2019s reputation as a leading electoral management body.  \n\nBallot paper principles \n\nThe AEC upholds the sanctity of the ballot paper in all its forms and at all times. This is given effect \nthrough two principles: \n\n\u25a0  All ballot papers remain \u2018live\u2019 from printing through to statutorily authorised destruction. \n\n\u25a0  The security, integrity and accountability of ballot papers must be preserved at all times \u2013 \n\nincluding transit and storage by the AEC, contractors, or other third parties. \n\nThese principles underpin all AEC planning, training, systems, handling and practices associated \nwith ballot papers. They show how important ballot paper security is and provides a basis for the \ntreatment of every ballot paper from printing to destruction by anyone who handles ballot papers, \nincluding but not limited to staff, polling officials and contractors.  \n\nVisual representation of the values and commitments \n\nThe values and commitments are captured in one visual representation (see below) to frame and \nguide how we work and underpin everything we do. This is displayed in all AEC offices and should \nact as a daily reminder of the importance of modelling these core values. It is important to continually \ntalk about the values and commitments and how they apply to you as an individual and as an \norganisation.  \n\n Page 7 \n\nAPS1 Induction and training booklet\n\n\n--- Page 9 ---\n\nPage 8 \n\nAPS1 Induction and training booklet\n\n\n--- Page 10 ---\n\nAustralian Public Service (APS) Values and Code of Conduct \n\nThe AEC is committed to providing a respectful workplace that supports a positive work environment, \nfree from inappropriate behaviour.  \n\nThe APS values set out the parliament\u2019s expectations, behaviours and performance standards of \nstaff working in the APS. You must at all times ensure your behaviours meet these standards which \ncan be remembered by the acronym ICARE. \n\nThe APS values \n\nImpartial \n\nThe APS is apolitical and provides the government with advice that is frank, honest, \ntimely and based on the best available evidence. \n\nCommitted to service \n\nThe APS is professional, objective, innovative and efficient, and works collaboratively \nto achieve the best results for the Australian community and the government. \n\nAccountable  \n\nThe APS is open and accountable to the Australian community under the law and \nwithin the framework of ministerial responsibility. \n\nRespectful  \n\nThe APS respects all people, including their rights and their heritage. \n\nEthical \n\nThe APS demonstrates leadership, is trustworthy, and acts with integrity, in all that it \ndoes. \n\nThe APS Code of Conduct is set out in s13 of the Public Service Act 1999 and lists the expected \nbehaviours and actions required of all staff working in the APS. This is not about how well you do \nyour job, but how you behave when undertaking your role. \n\nA breach of the Code of Conduct can result in sanctions, ranging from a reprimand to termination of \nemployment. \n\nThe Code of Conduct can be found on the following page. A brochure with more information is \navailable on the APSC website: https://www.apsc.gov.au/publication/aps-values-and-code-conduct-\npractice  \n\n Page 9 \n\nAPS1 Induction and training booklet\n\n\n--- Page 11 ---\n\nThe Code of Conduct \n\nThe Code of Conduct requires that an APS employee must: \n\n\uf0b7  behave honestly and with integrity in connection with APS employment; \n\n\uf0b7  act with care and diligence in connection with APS employment; \n\n\uf0b7  when acting in connection with APS employment, treat everyone with respect \n\nand courtesy, and without harassment; \n\n\uf0b7  when acting in connection with APS employment, comply with all applicable \n\nAustralian laws; \n\n\uf0b7  comply with any lawful and reasonable direction given by someone in the \n\nemployee's Agency who has authority to give the direction; \n\n\uf0b7  maintain appropriate confidentiality about dealings that the employee has with \n\nany Minister or Minister's member of staff; \n\n\uf0b7 \n\ntake reasonable steps to avoid any conflict of interest (real or apparent) and \ndisclose details of any material personal interest of the employee in \nconnection with the employee's APS employment; \n\n\uf0b7  use Commonwealth resources in a proper manner and for a proper purpose; \n\n\uf0b7  not provide false or misleading information in response to a request for \ninformation that is made for official purposes in connection with the \nemployee's APS employment; \n\n\uf0b7  not improperly use inside information or the employee's duties, status, power \n\nor authority: \n\n1.  to gain, or seek to gain, a benefit or an advantage for the employee or \n\nany other person; or \n\n2.  to cause, or to seek to cause, detriment to the employee's Agency, the \n\nCommonwealth or any other person.  \n\n\uf0b7  at all times behave in a way that upholds the APS Values and Employment \nPrinciples, and the integrity and good reputation of the employee's Agency \nand the APS; \n\n\uf0b7  while on duty overseas, at all times behave in a way that upholds the good \n\nreputation of Australia; and \n\n\uf0b7  comply with any other conduct requirement that is prescribed by the \n\nregulations (regulations available on the ComLaw website). \n\nThe Code of Conduct is set out in section 13 of the Public Service Act 1999. \n\n Page 10 \n\nAPS1 Induction and training booklet\n\n\n--- Page 12 ---\n\nAPS1 Administration Assistant \n\nAbout your role \n\nAn APS1 Administration Assistant is a casual staff member, usually located in a divisional, state or \nterritory office or at an out-posted centre. Your primary role is to provide administrative and \nprocessing support to the office during peak workload periods. You have been employed to provide \nadministrative support to your office in the lead up to, and during, the next federal election. The work \nyou will be doing is vitally important to the delivery of a successful election, and we will train and \nsupport you to do your tasks well. \n\nWe aim to give you as much notice as we can, but during the election you may be asked to stay at \nwork to complete a task at short notice. You should also expect to work a number of weekends \nduring the election period. \n\nDuties \n\nYour duties will include: \n\n\u25a0  handling counter and telephone enquiries \n\n\u25a0  checking and responding to emails \n\n\u25a0  preparing routine correspondence using automated systems \n\n\u25a0  performing photocopying, scanning, collating and mailing documents \n\n\u25a0  processing enrolment forms from clients applying to enrol or updating their \n\nexisting enrolment details \n\n\u25a0  helping to maintain the address register \n\n\u25a0  handling postal vote applications and returned postal vote certificates (during an \n\nelection) \n\n\u25a0  processing declaration vote envelopes to determine if the voter is able to have \n\ntheir vote counted (during an election) \n\n\u25a0  other tasks and projects as directed. \n\nPerformance plan \n\nIt is a requirement for all Australian Government employees (ongoing and non-ongoing) to have an \nindividual performance plan (IPP). An IPP is linked to organisational and business goals and \nmaintains the APS and AEC values. It also provides employees with a clear statement of \nperformance expectations. \n\nYour manager will meet with you to put your IPP in place and will advise if it will be done through the \nAurion Employee Self Service (ESS) facility or the IPP agreement and review paper form. \n\nAgile pool \n\nYou may be working in an agile pool of staff. This means that for certain tasks or projects you work \non, you may be required to report to someone other than your line manager. Your line manager will \nremain your point of contact for your timesheets, individual performance plan and any other matters. \n\n Page 11 \n\nAPS1 Induction and training booklet\n\n\n--- Page 13 ---\n\nTraining \n\nThe AEC\u2019s approach to learning is based on the 70:20:10 model. This is an approach where: \n\n\u25a0  70 per cent of learning is from experience \u2013 typically on the job experience and practice. \nStaff have access to self-directed learning tools, such as videos, asking the community, \nsimulations, blogs, job aids and knowledge management systems. Staff benefit from short \nterm secondments, job rotations and projects. \n\n\u25a0  20 per cent of learning is from others - both formal and informal coaching and mentoring \nfrom others, including participation in expert networks, forums and communities of practice. \n\n\u25a0  10 per cent of learning is structured - formal learning interventions and structured programs \n\nthat can involve assessment, accreditation and a mix of classroom and eLearning. \n\nMandatory eLearning courses  \n\nA list of all mandatory eLearning courses that are required to be completed within the first four weeks \nof commencing duties with the AEC is located at Attachment A. These eLearning courses can be \naccessed and completed via AEC Learning.  \n\nOther training resources \n\nThere are also a number of optional training resources listed in Attachment A that provide context \naround various election activities. These courses should be completed at the discretion of your \nsupervisor.  \n\nYour supervisor will work closely with you as you begin to work on real enrolment forms and check \nyour work to ensure they are satisfied with your learning. Where necessary, or if you request it, \naspects of the training can be covered again until you are managing your work confidently and with \nsuccess. \n\nWe undertake quality assurance processes, such as the Enrolment Quality Assurance Program \n(EQAP) to identify any enrolment processing errors. This will also help inform your learning progress, \nand we will discuss with you any errors or issues identified through the program. \n\n Page 12 \n\nAPS1 Induction and training booklet\n\n\n--- Page 14 ---\n\nUseful information \n\nTimesheets \n\nThe Aurion Employee Self Service (ESS) facility is the system used to submit your timesheets. You \ncan consult the Aurion ESS intranet page for user guides, forms and FAQs. Your supervisor will \nadvise if you are required to use Aurion ESS to manage your timesheets. \n\nWorkplace health and safety \n\nThe AEC strives to maintain a workplace environment that demonstrably values health, safety and \nwellbeing. \n\nYour supervisor will ensure you take regular breaks, and you must take a break after five consecutive \nhours of duty. If you feel you are not being given sufficient breaks, raise this with your supervisor. \n\nAEC employees are also required to take reasonable care for their own health and safety and to \nensure their own acts or omissions do not adversely affect others. You are required to follow \nreasonable instructions given by the AEC, and all AEC policies and procedures on Workplace Health \nand Safety.  \n\nVisit the Health, Safety and Wellbeing page on the intranet for more information. \n\nFatigue management \n\nFatigue is a state of mental and/or physical exhaustion which reduces a person's ability to perform \ntasks safely and effectively. \n\nThe AEC aims to create a safe and healthy work environment for all its workers, and prevent, as far \nas is reasonably practicable, fatigue affecting its workers. Fatigue is an ever-present risk in the AEC, \nin particular during election periods, and can't always be prevented, but must always be managed.  \n\nImproving the way the AEC manages fatigue can significantly improve the performance of workers \nand teams. This improvement leads to a reduction in errors, improved workplace efficiency and the \nelimination of, or the minimisation of, health and safety risks to workers. The risks of workers \nexperiencing fatigue arise from a range of sources and for a variety of reasons and can be different \nfor each individual worker. Fatigue can be caused by work related factors, factors outside work \nand/or a combination of both and may accumulate over time.  \n\nYour supervisor will discuss fatigue management with you, and the policies and support guides \navailable. Visit the Fatigue management and prevention page on the intranet for more information. \n\nSecurity \n\nSecurity passes \n\nYou will be issued with a security pass and you must wear it at all times while you are in an AEC \noffice. You must take off your pass when outside the office. \n\n Page 13 \n\nAPS1 Induction and training booklet\n\n\n--- Page 15 ---\n\nSystems and information security \n\nWhen you start, you will be given an AEC email address and access to the AEC\u2019s intranet. You must \nfollow AEC policies when using these systems, and relevant information is provided for you later in \nthis booklet. \n\nAs most of your work is systems based, you will also be given an individual login and password for \neach system you use. You are personally responsible for securing your login and password details, \nand for all activity on the systems undertaken using your login. The AEC actively monitors computer \nand systems usage. \n\nMisuse of our systems, unlawful access to the records of our clients or unlawful disclosure of \ninformation is taken very seriously by the AEC, and there are significant consequences for any \nbreach, including the possibility of legal proceedings. \n\nPrivate use of IT systems and social media \n\nYou are allowed to use the AEC\u2019s computer network for private purposes, as long as it's reasonable \n(for example, internet banking). You are not permitted to access or download illicit data or \ninformation, such as pornography, hacking, peer-to-peer networking or pirated software. \n\nThe AEC has important requirements that must be adhered to when it comes to the personal use of \nsocial media. You should consider the impact of your activities on the reputation of the AEC before \nyou make a comment or produce any content on social media. Your actions online must not conflict \nwith the AEC\u2019s political impartiality requirement and should not compromise public confidence in the \nagency or the APS. \n\nPersonal security \n\nEvery AEC office has an emergency warden and some offices also have a first aid officer. Your \ninduction to your local office will include information on evacuation procedures and an introduction to \nthese officers. \n\nVisitors to AEC offices who are accessing parts of the office that are not designated reception areas \nwill need to sign in, wear a visitor pass and be escorted at all times. If you notice a person in your \noffice who is not wearing a visitor pass or is not being escorted, please alert your supervisor who will \ndeal with the situation immediately. \n\nTelephone directories \n\nUp-to-date telephone directories for both divisional office staff and state office staff are available on \nthe intranet and on the local state collaboration sites. Your supervisor will show you how to navigate \nthese sites and access the telephone directories for your locality. \n\nYou can also find details about individual officers on the intranet by using the \u2018Search People\u2019 facility \nin the top-right search bar, or by searching their name in Microsoft Teams. \n\nMulti-function devices and printers \n\nThe AEC uses multi-function devices (MFDs), which provide staff with the ability to copy and print \ndocuments, and to scan and send documents to an email inbox. Unless your supervisor tells you \notherwise, all of your printing must be in black and white. You will be provided with an access card to \nlog you in to the MFD \u2013 this may be your building access card or a separate MFD card. \n\n Page 14 \n\nAPS1 Induction and training booklet\n\n\n--- Page 16 ---\n\nWhen printing, be conscious of paper usage, but also of the currency of the document into the future. \nDocuments like Quick Reference Guides often go out of date quickly when printed. \n\nMore information and assistance on connecting to a printer can be accessed in the AEC Service \nCentre's Knowledge Hub, through searching 'printer'. \n\nMicrosoft teams (AEC Teams) \n\nMicrosoft Teams is a communication platform where you can call, chat, meet and collaborate with \nAEC colleagues. The AEC has its own hosted implementation of Microsoft Teams, called AEC \nTEAMS. \n\nYou should use AEC TEAMS for all your collaboration needs, such as chat with colleagues, meetings \nand also live events. You have AEC TEAMS installed on your desktop ready to use. \n\nMore information and assistance on using AEC Teams can be accessed in the AEC Service Centre's \nKnowledge Hub, through searching 'Teams'. \n\n Page 15 \n\nAPS1 Induction and training booklet\n\n\n--- Page 17 ---\n\nPrivacy and security \n\nAs a government authority handling personal information, the AEC has very strict rules about privacy \nand security. Many of us have access to electors\u2019 personal information, including some information \nthat is highly sensitive, and we must take care at all times to uphold our responsibilities. AEC staff \nmembers also have limited access to records of clients of other government agencies, and \noccasionally medical information about an individual client. \n\nLegislation \n\nWhen handling personal information AEC staff must comply with the Australian Privacy Principles \n(APPs) under the Privacy Act 1988. The purpose of the Privacy Act is to protect the privacy of \nindividuals, and to protect personal information that is collected by entities such as the AEC. \n\nAs an AEC employee accessing personal information, you are also bound by the requirements of the \nthe Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918, the Code of Conduct set out in the Public Service Act 1999 \nand the Crimes Act 1914. Unlawful access, use or disclosure of elector information by an AEC staff \nmember is a breach of the Code of Conduct and, in some cases, is also a criminal offence. \n\nThe AEC publishes the following disclosure on our website: \n\nUnder the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918, the electoral roll (containing \nnames and addresses) may be supplied to prescribed authorities, members of \nparliament, political parties, approved medical researchers, public health \nprograms and electoral researchers. It is also used to maintain joint \nCommonwealth and state and territory electoral rolls. \n\nThis disclosure is therefore authorised by law. Only authorised delegates are permitted to provide \nthat information. \n\nMishandling of personal information \n\nPreserving the security of personal information is not only about ensuring compliance with the \nrequirements of the Privacy Act 1988. The Australian Privacy Principles (APPs) outline how the AEC \nmust handle, use and manage personal information. If we mishandle the personal information of our \nclients, it can cause them damage and, in turn, it can also lead to a loss of trust and considerable \nharm to our reputation. \n\nThe community expects that their sensitive information will be given a higher level of protection than \nnon-sensitive information. This expectation is reflected in the increased privacy protections that \napply. Sensitive information could include the risk to a client\u2019s personal safety or that of their family, a \nclient\u2019s movements overseas for work purposes (for example, for defence personnel), a client\u2019s \ncriminal sentence or health information that identifies an individual\u2019s medical condition. \n\nThe mishandling of sensitive information may: \n\n\u25a0  provide the basis for discrimination or other more severe types of harm \n\n\u25a0 \n\n\u25a0 \n\n Page 16 \n\nlead to humiliation or embarrassment, or undermine an individual\u2019s dignity \n\nimpact negatively on the AEC\u2019s reputation. \n\nAPS1 Induction and training booklet\n\n\n--- Page 18 ---\n\nYour responsibilities \n\nWhile employed by the AEC you must abide by all AEC privacy and security principles. You should \nalso report to your supervisor if you see a colleague doing anything that is a breach of the rules or is \nnot appropriate. \n\n\u25a0  You must never use AEC systems to access any enrolment record beyond the ones you need \nto process as part of your work. For example, you must never look up a friend or colleague\u2019s \naddress, birth date or telephone number. \n\n\u25a0  You must never leave your computer unlocked while you are away from your workstation, \n\nregardless of how long you are away, unless you can see your workstation for the entire time. \n\n\u25a0  You must lock away hardcopy enrolment records as per local filing protocols, including clients\u2019 \nmedical information, if you are away from your workstation for longer than 30 minutes and \novernight. \n\n\u25a0  You must never record the specifics of a client\u2019s medical condition (for example, \u2018dementia\u2019, \n\n\u2018schizophrenia\u2019) in RMANS or GENESIS. \n\n\u25a0  You will need to use information from other government agencies (such as driver\u2019s license \n\ndetails) so check with your supervisor about the correct use of the information. \n\n\u25a0  When talking to a client or other member of the public, you must never disclose information \nfrom their record unless you have confirmed you are talking to that individual. To confirm, \nensure the person gives you identifying information; never offer it to them. \n\n\u25a0 \n\nIndividuals who want the AEC to provide details of their enrolment record in writing must \nmake the request in writing themselves, and the AEC will respond in writing. The response \nwill only be given to the individual client. You won\u2019t be required to do this but you may be \ncalled upon to give advice to clients on this matter. \n\n\u25a0  Regardless of a person\u2019s official credentials (such as a police officer or lawyer), you must \nnever provide information or copies of an enrolment record, whatever the status of that \nenrolment. Log all such requests in the Public Engagement Contact Tool and refer them to \nyour supervisor. Ensure you upload any relevant documents into the Tool. \n\n\u25a0 \n\nIf you become aware that a staff member is mishandling personal information, for example, \naccessing personal information for any purpose outside of official AEC duties, you should \nreport the matter to a senior officer as soon as you can. \n\nMore information is available on the Privacy page on the intranet.  \n\nProtecting privacy \u2013 we all play a key role \n\nPrivacy, and the proper management of personal information and data, is a critical responsibility for \nthe AEC and its staff. \n\nEvery day AEC staff handle the personal information of electors and staff with a high degree of care \nand accuracy. It is a fact though that, on occasion, mistakes occur due to human error. Any human \nerror in the management of personal information can have a real human effect on those who entrust \nus with their information. \n\nTake the time to read the Quick reference guide on Privacy in Practice to help protect privacy and \nsecure personal information. \n\n Page 17 \n\nAPS1 Induction and training booklet\n\n\n--- Page 19 ---\n\nPublic enquiries  \n\nWhen interacting with the public, AEC staff are required to follow these guidelines so we can provide \nconsistent and professional client service. \n\nQuality client service \n\nThe aim of the AEC\u2019s public enquiry management is to fulfil our obligations under the AEC Service \nCharter. The Charter is a public-facing corporate document, informing the public of what to expect \nwhen interacting with the AEC and listing the reciprocated behaviours expected of the public by the \nAEC. \n\nThe AEC asks staff to: \n\n\u25a0 \n\ntake a positive helpful approach \n\n\u25a0  maintain sound and up-to-date knowledge of electoral processes \n\n\u25a0  consider how the client feels \n\n\u25a0  consider the individual circumstances of the client \n\n\u25a0 \n\nresolve enquiries in a timely manner. \n\nService level standards \n\nThe AEC is committed to providing timely responses, which means resolving enquiries at first point of \ncontact whenever possible. If an enquiry needs further investigation, staff should ensure the relevant \nservice level standards are met.  \n\nThe enquiry service level standards for our public contact channels are: \n\nPhone \n\nanswered within 90 seconds \n\nWalk-in \n\nacknowledged within five minutes \n\nEmail, post \n\nresponded to within five working days \n\nFurther information about the AEC\u2019s service level standards can be found on the Public engagement \nand complaints management intranet page. \n\nResolving straightforward enquiries at first point of contact \n\nWhere possible, enquiries should be handled at the first point of contact by the person who initially \nreceived it and often at the same time it is received. \n\nYou should attempt to resolve an enquiry when you receive it by: \n\n\u25a0 \n\n\u25a0 \n\nlistening to the enquirer and acknowledging their concerns \n\nidentifying the issue(s) \n\n\u25a0  clarifying anything that is unclear \n\n Page 18 \n\nAPS1 Induction and training booklet\n\n\n--- Page 20 ---\n\n\u25a0  considering individual circumstances \n\n\u25a0  keeping it simple by limiting your use of jargon and acronyms \n\n\u25a0 \n\ntaking personal responsibility for resolving the enquiry. \n\nWhere appropriate, you should advise enquirers about the services available through our website: \nwww.aec.gov.au.These services include checking their enrolment, updating their details or enrolling \nfor the first time. \n\nYou must record the details of the enquiry in the Public Engagement Contact Tool, including the \nresponse provided, and mark it as \u2018resolved\u2019. You must also attach a copy of any related \ncorrespondence.  \n\nHandling more complex enquiries \n\nComplex enquiries, or those for which the information is not reasonably able to be found, must be \nreferred to your supervisor. \n\nEnquiries from political parties, candidates and potential candidates must be referred to the Divisional \nReturning Officer as soon as possible. Record the details of the enquiry in the Public Engagement \nContact Tool, and escalate it through the tool, attaching copies of related correspondence. \n\nComplaints \n\nAll complaints are to be logged in the Public Engagement Contact Tool. \n\nYour supervisor will brief you on which complaints you can handle directly and which you should refer \nto a more senior staff member. \n\nComplaints should be acknowledged within three business days unless the matter can be resolved \nwithin three business days. If the matter needs to be referred for further advice, this must occur within \none business day to allow maximum time for the matter to be resolved by the receiving officer. \n\nComplaints are to be resolved within 10 business days. A quick guide to complaints management \nprovides further guidance on this process.  \n\nAEC email protocol \n\nEmails are the main way we send important information to each other in the AEC or request action. \nIn the course of your work, you may need to send emails to work colleagues or send responses to \nemail enquiries from members of the public, so you will need to follow these guidelines. \n\nSetting up your email signature \n\nThe AEC\u2019s email system is accessed via Microsoft Outlook on your computer\u2019s desktop. Before you \nuse the email system you need to set up your email signature. This is the block of text that will \nappear at the bottom of every email you send. It lists your name, title and phone numbers. \n\nYou can update your email signature block using the My Details tool, which is available to all staff via \nthe Start Menu and All Programs. More information and assistance on updating your email \nsignature can be accessed in the AEC Service Centre's Knowledge Hub, through searching \n'signature'. \n\n Page 19 \n\nAPS1 Induction and training booklet\n\n\n--- Page 21 ---\n\nDrafting an internal email \n\n\u25a0 \n\n\u25a0 \n\n\u25a0 \n\nIn the TO field: address the email to those AEC officers who need the information or who \nneed to act. \n\nIn the CC field: copy the email to other AEC staff who may need to be kept informed of the \nemail request or the information being conveyed. This will usually include the relevant \nmanager(s) of the primary addressees, and your own supervisor, and other AEC staff who \nhave a need to know. If you are unsure, clarify this with your supervisor. \n\nIn the SUBJECT field: at the beginning, indicate in capital letters whether the message is \nFOR INFORMATION or FOR ACTION. Clearly state the subject. If action is required, include \na due date. \n\nWhen composing the main part of the email in the Content space, keep in mind these guidelines: \n\n\u25a0  Remember that all emails sent at work are documents that may be retrieved and possibly \n\ndisclosed under Freedom of Information legislation (even when an email has been deleted). \n\n\u25a0  The content of emails should always be drafted in a polite, business-like and factual manner. \n\n\u25a0  Ensure your email contains your official AEC signature block (see above for the directions to \n\nset this up). \n\nEmails responding to enquiries by members of the public \n\nIf you need to send emails in response to public enquiries, check with your supervisor about how to \naccess standard responses to common requests on the AEC intranet and set them up using the \nQuick Steps facility in Outlook. \n\nBefore sending an email \n\n\u25a0  Mark it with the appropriate security classification. Emails you send will either be marked as \n\n\u2018OFFICIAL\u2019 or \u2018UNOFFICIAL\u2019. Check with your supervisor for the correct classification to use. \n\n\u25a0  Check that the recipients are correct and that if sending to multiple recipients the BCC field \n\nhas been used to protect their privacy. \n\n\u25a0  Ensure any attachments are correct for the intended recipient to avoid revealing personal \n\ninformation to the wrong person. \n\n\u25a0  Reflect on the clarity, tone and content of your message, bearing in mind all emails are \n\n Page 20 \n\nAPS1 Induction and training booklet\n\n\n--- Page 22 ---\n\npotentially disclosable in response to Freedom of Information requests. \n\n\u25a0  For further tips on writing, refer to the AEC\u2019s style guide - AEC writing style. \n\nRecordkeeping requirements after sending \n\nIf you are the person writing an original email (and not just replying to someone), your business area \nis most likely the \u2018owner\u2019 of the business activity or project that the email is about and it may need to \nbe filed in the AEC\u2019s electronic records management system, Objective IM. Check with your \nsupervisor about whether any email correspondence you send needs to be uploaded to Objective IM. \n\nIf you are required to use ObjectiveIM you will first need to complete the Information management \nand recordkeeping eLearning course prior to accessing ObjectiveIM. You can self-enrol in this \neLearning course in AEC Learning.  \n\nThe Information and Knowledge Management (IKM) section provides instructor-led Objective training \nvia MS Teams for all new staff at the AEC. To register to attend a session search for \u2018ObjectiveIM\u2019 in \nAEC Learning. For best results learners are encouraged to attend the training as soon as possible \nafter completing the Information management and recordkeeping eLearning course. By the end of \nthe training, you will be able to do the following within Objective: \n\n\u25a0  understand the AEC file structure \n\n\u25a0  upload and edit documents \n\n\u25a0  search for records \n\n\u25a0  upload emails \n\n\u25a0  send and access Objective link/reference \n\n\u25a0 \n\nrename files and edit/view metadata. \n\nEmail etiquette \n\nUsed properly, email can assist in maintaining good working relationships, increase productivity and \nprovide efficiencies. Please follow this list of tips in your electronic communications: \n\n\u25a0  Communicate in clear, professional language. If in doubt, it is better to be overly formal rather \n\nthan unprofessional. \n\n\u25a0  Do not send anything you would not be comfortable showing to your colleagues or being seen \n\npublicly. Consider that email is more like a postcard than a sealed envelope with a letter in it. \n\n\u25a0  Treat email like any other business communication; pay attention to spelling and grammar. \n\nRun the spell check if need be. \n\n\u25a0  Re-read and check what you have written before you send it. \n\n\u25a0  Be concise and tactful. \n\n\u25a0  Break up the text by using short lines and paragraphs; this makes it easier to read. \n\n\u25a0  Do not write in UPPERCASE or bold, which may be perceived as shouting or telling off the \n\nrecipient. \n\n\u25a0  Copyright laws apply to electronic mail as well as printed media. \n\n\u25a0  Respond promptly to email messages \u2013 even if it is just to let the sender know that you will \n\nreply in full later. \n\nRemember that all laws that apply to discrimination, defamation and harassment (verbal, emotional \nand sexual) also apply to electronic communication. \n\n Page 21 \n\nAPS1 Induction and training booklet\n\n\n--- Page 23 ---\n\nAttachment A \u2013Training for APS1 staff \n\nMandatory eLearning courses \nAPS1 staff will be automatically enrolled in the below mandatory eLearning courses via AEC \nLearning and must complete them within four weeks of commencing duties.  \n\nCategory \n\nCourse name \n\nDuration \n\nWhere to find it \n\nMandatory learning \nprogram \n\nWork, Health and Safety \nProtective Security Awareness \nFraud Awareness \nPrivacy Awareness \nIT Security \nET201 Ballot Paper Handling \nCultural Appreciation \nCOVID-19 \n\n30 min \n\n30 min \n\n30 min \n\n30 min \n\n30 min \n\n30 min \n\n30 min \n\n30 min \n\nAEC Learning \n\nManager-directed self-enrolment \nSupervisors should work with APS1 staff to identify additional eLearning courses relevant to their \nduties.

The program is designed to set \nclear expectations regarding the roles and responsibilities of Participants and the agency, and it will \nguide the performance and professional development of all staff, laying the foundations of the AEC\u2019s \nworking environment, agency values and agency expectations. \n\nLearning outcomes \n\nBy the end of the program Participants will be able to: \n\n1.  Behave in accordance with the AEC values and commitments, and describe why they \n\nunderpin the work of the AEC. \n\n2.  Make decisions and demonstrate behaviours that represent the APS values and comply with \n\nthe APS Code of Conduct. \n\n3.  Promote and contribute to a positive organisational culture based on quality, agility and \n\nprofessionalism. \n\n4.  Apply learning to role that is compliant with policies, procedures and legislation relevant to the \n\nAEC. \n\n5.  Recognise the importance of transparency in the AEC and its impact on reputation and public \n\nperception. \n\n6.  Identify how their role contributes to AEC business outcomes and agency objectives. \n7.  Identify the internal and external factors of the AEC\u2019s environment and consider them when \n\nperforming their role. \n\n8.  Explain the role of Parliament, the role the AEC plays in its formation and the importance of \n\npolitical neutrality. \n\n9.  Explain the guiding principles of electoral management and the three levels of government in \n\nAustralia.\n\n\n--- Page 2 ---\n\nProgram Design \n\nThe program is split across three (3) phases with modules and resources provided to support each \nphase. The program is designed to be delivered to a Participant over a period of five months and will \ncommence from two weeks prior to starting their role. \n\nPhase \n\nTiming \n\nOutcome \n\nPhase 1 \u2013 Pre-commencement \n\nModule 1 \n\nFrom 2 weeks prior to \ncommencement \n\nPhase 2 \u2013 Development \n\nDay 1 \u2013 5 months \n\nModules 2 \u2013 8 \n\nModules 10a or 10b \n\nPhase 3 \u2013 Follow up \n\nDay 1 \u2013 5 months \n\nModules 2 \u2013 8 \n\nModules 10a or 10b  \n\nReview \n\nModule 9 \n\n6 months \n\nThe Participant will have actioned all \nnecessary recruitment activities and have an \nunderstanding of the agency\u2019s role and \nexpectations of staff and self. \n\nThe Line Manager has completed required \nactivities to ensure smooth transition on Day \none.  \n\nThe Participant and identified key staff \ninvolved in program delivery have successfully \nunderstood and participated in assigned \ninduction modules, including on the job \ntraining, and are confident that future activities \nwill be actioned in accordance with the AEC \nvalues and expectations. \n\nThe Participant and the Line Manager have \nhad meaningful discussion at all \u2018Check-in \nPoints\u2019 throughout the program. \n\nThe Line Manager and Executive Level Officer \nare confident that the programs overall \nlearning outcomes have been met. \n\nObservation of learning in action continues. \nFeedback has been provided to the NTEU for \nfurther program development and updates.  \n\nParticipation \n\nThe Participant group for the program will be staff that gain an ongoing or non-ongoing role within the \nAEC at the following levels: \n\n\uf0b7  APS2-APS6 \n\n\uf0b7  Executive Level (EL) \n\n\uf0b7  Senior Executive Services (SES) \n\nWhere AEC staff gain promotion, they will not be required to participate in the full program, but \nshould review the modules in consultation with their manager, and undertake identified compulsory \nactivities e.g. the AEC Foundation Programs. \n\nFor staff who gain a non-ongoing role within the AEC, they will be required to participate in the \nprogram up until the point in which their contract expires. If a staff member leaves the AEC at the \nconclusion of their contract and then returns within a six month period, they will be expected to \ncontinue working through the program until it is completed.\n\n\n--- Page 3 ---\n\nThe Program will require the identification of the following staff to support program delivery: \n\n\uf0b7  Line Manager - the responsible officer that will conduct the induction locally and either \n\nundertake or delegate induction activities. The Line Manager will also be responsible for \nproviding feedback on performance. \n\n\uf0b7  Local Induction Adviser - will help the Participant settle in and act as their primary contact on \n\ngeneral enquiries and day to day operational issues. \n\n\uf0b7  Executive Level Officer \u2013 through consultation with the Line Manager, they will ensure that \nexpectations of the program are being met, that mandatory training is being completed and \nthat the Participant is fit for the organisation prior to the probation period end date (where \napplicable). \n\n\uf0b7  Local Trainers - taken from the AEC\u2019s assessed trainer pool, they may be responsible for \n\ndelivery of face to face session content for Participants in their office/state/branch or in other \nlocations, where required. \n\n\uf0b7  NTEU \u2013 will deliver face to face sessions to Participants in Canberra, including any relevant \n\ndelivery to National Office branches.  \n\nRoles and responsibilities for identified staff are clearly outlined in the resources developed for the \nprogram. \n\nCurriculum \n\nThe program is designed to provide the Participant with consistent guidance and an understanding of \nthe agency\u2019s values, expected behaviours, corporate and operating environment, agency direction \nand purpose. \n\nSpecific information on the Participant\u2019s job role, will be driven by their level and area of the \norganisation, and is accounted for under a capability framework and specific job role requirements. \nThese critical infrastructure pieces are being developed in parallel to the induction program. \n\nA set curriculum has been developed for the program outlining subject matter and staff involvement. \nThe curriculum provides visibility to all staff involved in the program about what will be discussed \nthroughout the five months. \n\nThe program aligns with other AEC timeframes and requirements including the development of \nIndividual Performance Plans (IPPs), probationary reporting and the completion of mandatory \ntraining. The program will direct the Participant and the Line Manager to the existing resources \navailable in these areas. \n\nThe curriculum features a two day AEC Foundation Program \u2013 National Experience in Canberra for \nthose staff at the APS6 \u2013 SES level and a one day Network Experience conducted in the states for \nthose staff at the APS2 \u2013 APS5 level. These programs are designed to support the Participant in \nmeeting the learning outcomes and provide an opportunity for the Participant to build their peer \nnetworks. Programs will be conducted twice annually with some travel required for identified staff. \n\nNOTE: As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the inaugural programs will be delivered as a virtual \nfacilitator led experience. The AEC Foundation Program \u2013 National Experience will be held virtually \nover a two week period, and the Network Experience will be held virtually over a one week period. \nOnce COVID-19 restrictions are eased, the AEC will review the Foundation Programs. \n\nSee Attachment A for an overview of the program curriculum. \n\nResources \n\nA series of induction modules have been developed by the NTEU to ensure that delivery of the \nprogram is nationally consistent, professional and in line with the curriculum and learning outcomes.\n\n\n--- Page 4 ---\n\nModules are available to identified staff through a dedicated National Induction Program SharePoint \npage located on the Learning Hub. Through the Learning Hub staff will be able to access the \nfollowing materials: \n\n\uf0b7  Manager Guides - each module will feature a Manager Guide that will provide the Line \n\nManager and the Local Induction Adviser with information and resources to support topics \nbeing discussed and undertaken at that time. \n\n\uf0b7  Checklists \u2013 each module will have a Checklist that will work in conjunction with the Manager \n\nGuide to ensure that Line Managers, the Local Induction Adviser and the Participant \nundertake their required actions. \n\n\uf0b7  Participant Guides \u2013 identified modules will feature a Participant Guide that will provide the \n\nParticipant with additional reading and required actions to support their learning. \n\n\uf0b7  Resources \u2013 each module will have assigned resources including scenarios, case studies, \ntemplates and activities to support the delivery of the program and ensure consistency. \n\n\uf0b7 \n\n\uf0b7 \n\nInduction eLearning course \u2013 an induction eLearning course has been developed allowing the \nParticipant to gain an initial understanding of the AEC\u2019s working environment, including the \nAEC values and expectations. \n\nInduction videos \u2013 a series of short videos have been recorded by members of the Executive \nLeadership Team introducing themselves, welcoming the Participant to the agency and \npromoting specific key information e.g. the AEC Corporate Plan, strategic direction and their \nexpectations of staff. \n\nAdditional program resources including staff roles and responsibilities have been developed, as well \nas facilitator guides and facilitator resources for the AEC Foundation Program \u2013 National and \nNetwork Experience. \n\nConsultation \n\nThe NTEU reviewed current AEC content against the program objectives, identifying gaps in \nresources and engaging with business owners in content development. The NTEU designed and \ndeveloped materials to support the program, and business owners were consulted and reviewed all \nmodule content and eLearning as required. \n\nThe Learning and Development Community of Practice supported the program through testing, which \nensured the program was fit for purpose and user friendly. \n\nFeedback has been discussed throughout the consultation phase and changes have been made to \nthe program as required. \n\nAll identified staff who participate in the program are required to provide feedback and undertake an \nevaluation of the program upon completion of each module."}, {"type": "pdf", "output_file_path": "/downloaded_originals/11.

Most calls to this phone number will be diverted \nto a divisional office after the caller enters their postcode. Where a caller does not enter a \npostcode, the call is diverted to their state office. All calls to this number from within \nAustralia are the cost of a local call. Overseas callers cannot dial this number. \n\n\u25a0  +61 2 6160 2600 \u2013 This number is advertised on our website specifically for people who \nare calling from overseas. This directs people to enter the postcode for their enrolled \naddress. Their call is then diverted to the relevant divisional office, based on the postcode \nthey enter. If no postcode is entered, the call is diverted to the National Office switchboard \nnumber, below. \n(02) 6271 4411 \u2013 AEC switchboard in National Office. This number is published on our \nwebsite along with our state office switchboard numbers. \nInterpreter calls \u2013 This is a service where non-English speaking callers can have a three-\nway conversation with the AEC, assisted by an interpreter in their own language.

Please let the caller know this information is available and offer to email \nor mail this information to them, as they may have trouble navigating our website, which is written \nin English. \n\nInvoices from Interpreter companies \nAlthough we have a contract in place with LanguageLoop, we also accept calls made via Home \nAffairs\u2019 TIS. A Spending Approval form must be completed at the start of each financial year for \nTis if we decide to keep accepting interpreter calls from them. This is signed off by the relevant \nbranch delegate, usually our Director.  \n\nAt the start of each month, we receive invoices in the Public Engagement mailbox from both \ncompanies.

Please check the itemised list of calls is correct, as per the instructions \nbelow, before approving any public spending. Once you have approved them, complete and code \nthe invoices and send a copy of the Vits account to Accounts to be paid. The Tis invoice is paid \nby credit card.

It is a government initiative managed through the Australian \nCommunications and Media Authority (ACMA). People are able to call the AEC via the NRS to \nfacilitate the conversation. \n\nWhen you receive an NRS-facilitated call, the relay officer will announce the call to you, such as, \n\u2018Hello, I have a call for the AEC from the National Relay Service. I have [caller\u2019s name] on the \nline. Please go ahead\u2019.   \n\nYou may find that there is a short delay as the relay officer uses their keyboard to type your \nresponse to the caller and the caller types to the NRS in return. You may hear the relay officer on \nthe line, or in some cases, the caller themselves.  \n\nDuring the call, it may be useful to say \u2018Go ahead\u2019 when you have finished speaking. We do not \nreceive invoices for this service. It is a government initiative open to anyone to use. \n\nRecorded messages for switchboard \nCallers who ring the National Office switchboard number (02 6271 4411) outside our business \nhours (9-5pm) will hear a pre-recorded message providing them with information regarding our \nhours of operation.   \n\nPage 9    Public Enquiries Handbook |  \nObjective: SD&F > Roll Ops & Client Services > Public Engagement > Public Enquiries > Policy and Procedure, or \nhttps://objective.prod.aec.gov.au/documents/fA94851\n\n\n--- Page 11 ---\n\nIt is our responsibility to record these messages when they require changing.

If you are archiving 2020 data for example, a new folder needs \nto be created under 2020 titled \u2018Sent\u2019. All emails from the INFO sent folder must be moved into \nthis folder. This makes searching for a sent email a lot faster. This also means at the start of each \nyear, the INFO sent folder will be empty. \n\nINFO Personal Message Manager (PMM) \nThe PMM is a SPAM (junk mail) filter. This works in the background to filter out any incoming \nemails which the AEC IT system thinks may be junk or malicious.  \n\nEach afternoon at 3pm, you will usually receive an email from pmm@aec.gov.au. It contains a \nlink for you to check any emails which the system has deemed to be possible spam or malicious. \nYou must check the spam for each of the three shared mailboxes each day. Also check your \npersonal mailbox.  \n\nTo add the shared mailboxes to your spam filter, refer to the image below. Select the \u2018Options\u2019 \ntab in the blue toolbar at the top of the page, then select \u2018new\u2019. \n\nEnter the shared mailbox address and select OK. \n\nPage 13    Public Enquiries Handbook |  \nObjective: SD&F > Roll Ops & Client Services > Public Engagement > Public Enquiries > Policy and Procedure, or \nhttps://objective.prod.aec.gov.au/documents/fA94851\n\n\n--- Page 15 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 16 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 17 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 18 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 19 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 20 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 21 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 22 ---\n\nIf the enquiry is an APS staff member, they should be transferred to: \n\nHuman Resources/Payroll  \n\nThere are also Recruitment Officers, WH&S Officers, Rehabilitation Case Managers, etc., which \nyou may need to transfer calls through to.

Following the implementation of the \nElectoral and Referendum Amendment (Access to the roll and other measures) Act 2004, the roll \nwas prohibited from sale. \n\nPre-2004 enrolment data may also exist on other internet sites (e.g. ancestry.com). \n\nPage 22    Public Enquiries Handbook |  \nObjective: SD&F > Roll Ops & Client Services > Public Engagement > Public Enquiries > Policy and Procedure, or \nhttps://objective.prod.aec.gov.au/documents/fA94851\n\n\n--- Page 24 ---\n\nCopies of the current electoral roll may only be disclosed to prescribed persons or organisations \nas listed in the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918. \n\nEnrolment Fraud \nIn order to manage the workload associated with the investigation of possible enrolment fraud, \nRMCE and the enrolment network take on a triage role, undertaking the initial investigation of \npotential cases. \n\nAll potential cases of enrolment fraud should now be forwarded to RMCE \nfirst instance. \n\n in the \n\nIndustrial elections and Protected Action Ballots (PAB) \nThe AEC conducts other elections in accordance with the Fair Work Act. \n\nIf you receive any enquiries regarding Industrial Elections or PABs, a list of industrial elections we \nare currently running is available on our website:  \n\nhttps://www.aec.gov.au/ieb/industrial-elections.htm \n\nPlease refer any enquiries either to the relevant state Returning Officer, as per the table below, or \nto: \n\nIndustrial Elections: \n\nPage 23    Public Enquiries Handbook |  \nObjective: SD&F > Roll Ops & Client Services > Public Engagement > Public Enquiries > Policy and Procedure, or \nhttps://objective.prod.aec.gov.au/documents/fA94851\n\n\n--- Page 25 ---\n\nAppendix A \n\nIncoming calls \nIt is important to determine the nature of all calls as a first step. \n\n\uf0b7  The switchboard number receives a fair number of marketing and sales calls. These are \n\nnot to be transferred to staff.  \n\n\uf0b7  You may not confirm any of the following information to a caller: whether a person works \nfor the AEC, a person\u2019s work number, a person\u2019s email address, or the format of AEC \nemail addresses  - e.g. \n\nCalls for Senior Executive Staff (Assistant Commissioners and above).  \n\n\uf0b7  Do not transfer calls from members of the public. Take a message. You could say, \u201cI \ncannot transfer your call to the Electoral Commissioner, but I can take a message and \npass it to her/his office for action.\u201d \n\n\uf0b7 \n\nIf the caller identifies themselves as a member or senator, executive office holder \n(President, Vice-President, Secretary) of a major political party, or a person from \nanother Government Agency, contact the relevant Executive Assistant in the \nExecutive Area (for a member of ELT) or Branch Project Officer to discuss. \n\nTransferring a call to an internal number \nTo transfer a call to an internal extension number: \n\n\u25a0  When you answer a call, your telephone screen will display a button marked \u2018Transfer\u2019. \n\nPress the button. \n\n\u25a0  Dial the extension number.  \n\u25a0  Wait for the ring tone. \n\u25a0  Speak to the EA and provide them with the caller details. \n\u25a0 \n\u25a0  The call is now transferred. \n\nIf they choose to accept the call, press the button marked \u2018Transfer\u2019 again and hang up. \n\nTransferring a call \nIf the call is for an AEC help desk, there is no need to announce the caller before transferring the \ncall.

You can also forward the \nswitchboard phone to another area within the AEC if needed. \n\nThese messages are recorded by us. \n\nStandard Business Hours \nA recorded message is automatically activated each working day. Calls will come through to the \nSwitchboard from 9am each business day until 5pm when callers will receive a message to say \nwe are closed. Provided standard business hours don\u2019t change, you will not need to record a \nmessage for this service. \n\nAt election time, calls go directly to the call centre. As the call centre has extended hours, there is \nno need to record another message. When the call centre is closed, callers will hear our standard \nbusiness hours message. \n\nPublic Holidays  \nOn public holidays a message needs to be recorded to advise callers we are closed. The \nmessages to use are provided below. See Appendix E \u2013 Changing the recording on the \nSwitchboard phone. \n\nEmergency  \nThe emergency message is used in the event there is an emergency and it is safe for you to \nrecord a new message.  \n\nForwarding the Public Enquiry phone to another area within the AEC \n\nTo transfer calls to another phone while the Public Engagement team is away \n\nTransferring switchboard to an internal number \n\n\uf0b7  Pick up handset on \n\nphone \n\n\uf0b7  On the phone touchscreen, press Fwd Reception (FR) \n\nPage 26    Public Enquiries Handbook |  \nObjective: SD&F > Roll Ops & Client Services > Public Engagement > Public Enquiries > Policy and Procedure, or \nhttps://objective.prod.aec.gov.au/documents/fA94851\n\n\n--- Page 28 ---\n\n\uf0b7  Enter the five-digit number (or any number you want the calls to be forwarded to).

Main Purpose of the FOI Request\n\nFOI Request No. LEX3437 sought:\n*   Policies, guidelines, directives, rules, and procedures governing:\n    *   The process of selecting measures implemented by the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) to ensure staff adherence to the APS Values, Employment Principles, and Code of Conduct.\n    *   Any limitation, restriction, or prohibition authorized by the AEC on telephone communication of its staff with members of the public, including call filtering.\n*   Memoranda of understanding (MOUs) setting out arrangements for liaison between the AEC and the Australian Federal Police (AFP) concerning information sharing, complaint handling, and other operational matters.\n\n#### 2. Documents from the FOI Request\n\nThe following documents were released in response to the request:\n*   `AEC Procedures for determining breaches of the APS Code of Conduct and Sanctions` (December 2018)\n*   `Acknowledgement and declaration of key obligations` (Undated)\n*   `Letter of engagement as an ongoing APS employee` (Undated)\n*   `APS1 Induction and training booklet` (February 2022)\n*   `National Induction Program: Outline` (Undated)\n*   `National Induction Program: Curriculum Overview` (Undated)\n*   `National Induction Program: Roles and Responsibilities` (Undated)\n*   `National Induction Program: Detailed curriculum and associated learning outcomes` (Undated)\n*   `Public Engagement Team Handbook` (November 2022)\n\n*(Note: The schedule of released documents also listed \"AEC Intranet page: Dealing with difficult behavior\", \"AEC Intranet page: AEC values and commitments\", \"AEC Intranet page: Conditions of employment\", and \"AEC Intranet page: Key obligations as an APS employee\" but these documents were not provided in the given text.)*\n\n#### 3. Main Content from the FOI Request Documents\n\nThe released documents provide content primarily related to the first part of the FOI request concerning staff adherence to professional standards and limitations on public communication. No documents were provided regarding MOUs with the Australian Federal Police.\n\n##### a. Measures for AEC Staff Adherence to APS Values, Employment Principles, and Code of Conduct:\n\n*   **Formal Breach Procedures:**\n    *   `AEC Procedures for Determining Breaches of the APS Code of Conduct and Sanctions` outlines the process for investigating suspected breaches of the APS Code of Conduct, including who can determine a breach, the requirement for procedural fairness (informing the employee, opportunity to respond, independent decision-makers), and the selection of proportionate sanctions (ranging from reprimand to termination). Records of determinations and sanctions are required.\n*   **Obligation Acknowledgement at Engagement:**\n    *   The `Acknowledgement and declaration of key obligations` form requires staff to acknowledge their commitment to political neutrality, avoiding conflicts of interest, accuracy of provided information, Work Health and Safety (WHS) compliance, and familiarity with relevant legislation (including the Public Service Act 1999) and AEC policies. It specifically references the APS Values, APS Employment Principles, and Code of Conduct as key obligations.\n    *   The `Letter of engagement as an ongoing APS employee` explicitly states that engagement is conditional on \"Complying with the Australian Public Service (APS) Values and Code of Conduct.\" It reiterates the requirement for political neutrality and details several points of the APS Code of Conduct (e.g., honesty, diligence, respect, compliance with laws/directions, confidentiality, conflict of interest avoidance, proper resource use, not providing false information, upholding integrity). Failure to meet these conditions can lead to offer withdrawal or employment termination.\n*   **Induction and Training Programs:**\n    *   The `APS1 Induction and training booklet` introduces new staff to the AEC's values (Electoral Integrity, Quality, Agility, Professionalism, \"Every task matters,\" and \"Ballot paper principles\"), the APS Values (ICARE: Impartial, Committed to service, Accountable, Respectful, Ethical), and the full text of the APS Code of Conduct. It emphasizes that Code breaches can lead to sanctions up to termination. It lists mandatory eLearning courses covering WHS, Protective Security, Fraud, Privacy, IT Security, and Ballot Paper Handling, among others.\n    *   The `National Induction Program` documents (`Outline`, `Curriculum Overview`, `Roles and Responsibilities`, `Detailed curriculum and associated learning outcomes`) describe a structured, nationally consistent induction program for APS2-SES staff (APS1 staff are noted as outside its direct scope, but are covered by the APS1 booklet). This program aims to ensure staff behave in accordance with AEC/APS values and the Code of Conduct, promote a positive organizational culture, and comply with policies and legislation. The curriculum explicitly includes modules on APS Values and Code of Conduct, Privacy, Protective Security, Fraud, Political Neutrality, Conflict of Interest, and Public Governance. It defines the roles and responsibilities of Line Managers, Local Induction Advisers, Executive Level Officers, and Trainers in guiding new staff to meet these standards, emphasizing professional conduct and adherence to established procedures.\n\n##### b. Limitations, Restrictions, or Prohibitions on Telephone Communication with Members of the Public:\n\n*   **Public Engagement Team Handbook:**\n    *   Outlines the responsibilities of Public Enquiries Officers, including answering calls to the National Office switchboard and managing public email inquiries.\n    *   Details contact telephone numbers, hours of operation (9am-5pm, Mon-Fri, diverted to call centre during federal elections).\n    *   Provides procedures for **Interpreter Calls** and the **National Relay Service**.\n    *   Specifies instructions for **Transferring switchboard to an internal number** and back.\n    *   Under \"Incoming calls\" (Appendix A), it explicitly states:\n        *   Marketing and sales calls are *not* to be transferred to staff.\n        *   Officers *may not confirm* whether a person works for the AEC, a person\u2019s work number, a person\u2019s email address, or the format of AEC email addresses.\n        *   For Senior Executive Staff (Assistant Commissioners and above), Public Enquiries Officers *do not transfer calls from members of the public*; instead, they take a message. For MPs, Senators, major political party executives, or other Government Agency callers, contact relevant Executive Assistants or Branch Project Officers for discussion.\n    *   Details the AEC's responsibility for recording **Recorded messages for switchboard** for outside business hours, public holidays, and emergencies, including specific scripts for these messages.\n*   **APS1 Induction and Training Booklet:**\n    *   Includes a \"Public Enquiries\" section with guidelines for quality client service, emphasizing a positive and helpful approach, accurate information, and timely resolution.\n    *   Sets \"Service level standards\" for public contact channels: Phone (answered within 90 seconds), Walk-in (acknowledged within 5 minutes), Email/Post (responded within 5 working days).\n    *   Instructs staff to resolve straightforward inquiries at the first point of contact and record them in the Public Engagement Contact Tool (PECT).\n    *   For more complex inquiries, or those from political parties/candidates, staff are instructed to refer them to their supervisor or the Divisional Returning Officer (DRO).\n    *   All complaints are to be logged in PECT, acknowledged promptly, and resolved within 10 business days.\n\n##### c.

The **Public Engagement Team Handbook** highlights the mandatory use of interpreter services (LanguageLoop, Home Affairs\u2019 TIS) for non-English speakers and the National Relay Service for individuals with hearing or speech impairments. This aligns directly with progressive values of equitable access and inclusive governance, ensuring all citizens, regardless of linguistic or physical barriers, can participate.\n    *   The **Letter of Engagement** and **National Induction Program Curriculum** detail provisions for \"Reasonable Adjustment Support\" for staff with disabilities, indicating an institutional commitment to workplace inclusion and fair employment practices.\n    *   The **National Induction Program Curriculum** also features dedicated modules on \"Cultural Appreciation,\" \"Working with Indigenous Australians,\" and \"Diversity, culture and inclusion,\" which are strong positive indicators of the AEC's commitment to equity and representation within its workforce and operations.\n    *   Emphasis on treating \"everyone with respect and courtesy\" is consistently woven through the **APS Code of Conduct** (reiterated in multiple documents), reinforcing a foundation of dignity in public interactions.\n\n2.  **Privacy and Data Protection:**\n    *   The documents underscore a stringent approach to privacy, particularly concerning elector information. The **APS1 Induction and Training Booklet** and **Public Engagement Team Handbook** emphasize \"very strict rules about privacy and security\" and explicitly prohibit unauthorized access (e.g., looking up a friend's details) or disclosure of personal data, which can constitute a criminal offence. This robust commitment to data integrity and individual privacy rights strongly aligns with progressive concerns about digital civil liberties and the misuse of personal information by government entities.\n\n3.  **Accountability and Transparency (within limits):**\n    *   The **Public Engagement Team Handbook** details a structured \"Public Engagement Contact Tool (PECT)\" for logging all public inquiries, feedback, and complaints, alongside a \"Complaints Management Framework.\" This systematic approach to tracking public interactions and addressing grievances fosters governmental accountability and responsiveness.\n    *   The **National Induction Program Outline** explicitly lists \"Recognise the importance of transparency in the AEC and its impact on reputation and public perception\" as a core learning outcome, demonstrating an institutional understanding of the value of open governance.\n    *   The **AEC Procedures for Determining Breaches of the APS Code of Conduct** mandates procedural fairness for employees facing misconduct allegations, and requires independent and unbiased decision-makers, aligning with principles of fair process.\n\n4.  **Anti-Corruption and Responsible Public Finance:**\n    *   The **Letter of Engagement** and **APS1 Induction and Training Booklet** detail the **APS Code of Conduct** provisions requiring honesty, integrity, avoidance of conflicts of interest, and proper use of Commonwealth resources. This directly combats corporate influence and ensures public funds are managed responsibly, aligning with progressive anti-corruption stances.\n    *   The **National Induction Program Curriculum** includes training on \"Procurement and contract management\" and \"Public Governance and Accountability,\" indicating a proactive approach to ensuring ethical financial practices.\n    *   The **Public Engagement Team Handbook** shows due diligence in verifying interpreter service invoices, preventing misuse of public funds. Restrictions on the sale and broad public access to the electoral roll post-2004 also align with a progressive desire to limit commercialization of public data and potential corporate exploitation.\n\n**Deviation from Progressive Values:**\n\n1.  **Civil Liberties (Freedom of Political Expression for Staff):**\n    *   The most significant area of deviation from broad progressive civil liberties is the exceptionally strict and broadly interpreted \"political neutrality\" requirement imposed on AEC staff. The **Acknowledgement and declaration of key obligations** and **Letter of Engagement** explicitly state that AEC cannot employ anyone who \"publicly engages in political activities or who intends to do so, or where there is a perception that the person is involved with such activity.\" The **APS1 Induction and Training Booklet** extends this to social media, noting that \"Your actions online must not conflict with the AEC\u2019s political impartiality requirement.\"\n    *   While the necessity of perceived impartiality for an electoral body is acknowledged for maintaining public trust, this policy imposes substantial restrictions on the freedom of expression and political participation of public servants in their private lives. From a progressive perspective, such a broad prohibition, especially covering \"perception,\" can be seen as an overreach that chills civic engagement and limits the democratic rights of individuals merely by virtue of their employment in the public service. It prioritizes institutional reputation over individual civil liberties to an extent that warrants critical examination.\n\n2.  **Transparency (Potential for Less Scrutiny in Misconduct Cases):**\n    *   A minor point of concern arises from the **AEC Procedures for Determining Breaches of the APS Code of Conduct**, which notes that \"Not all suspected breaches of the Code may need to be dealt with by way of a determination. In particular circumstances, another way of dealing with a suspected breach of the Code may be more appropriate.\" While procedural fairness is maintained, if \"another way\" implies a less formal or less publicly transparent process, it could potentially reduce accountability for certain types of misconduct.\n\nIn summary, the AEC documents demonstrate a robust commitment to core progressive values concerning social justice, accessibility, privacy, and anti-corruption within its operational framework. However, the stringent \"political neutrality\" requirements, particularly impacting employees' off-duty conduct and expression, present a notable tension with broader progressive ideals of individual civil liberties and freedom of political participation.", "model": "gemini-2.5-flash", "generated_at": "2025-06-22T13:28:12.588673", "source_hash": "774e2087cd5f137bd54221942442b4d0ac3b605d0e72f352e803521a4252a5e1", "raw_response_path": "data/llm_responses/LEX3437__overall__left_leaning__20250622T132812.json", "output_tokens": 1198, "prompt_tokens": 46785, "total_tokens": 52970, "summary_length": 6840}, "short_index": {"text": "From a left-leaning perspective, the Australian Electoral Commission's (AEC) internal documents largely align with progressive values, demonstrating a strong commitment to social justice through accessible electoral services for all citizens, robust privacy protections for elector data, and a clear dedication to accountability, anti-corruption, and responsible public finance within its operations. The AEC's emphasis on diversity, cultural appreciation, and fair workplace practices further reinforces these positive alignments. However, a significant deviation emerges from the exceptionally strict political neutrality requirements imposed on staff, which broadly curtail employees' freedom of political expression and participation, including in their private lives and on social media, even based on perception. While acknowledging the need for impartiality in an electoral body, this extensive restriction on civil liberties is viewed as an overreach that chills civic engagement, prioritizing institutional reputation at the expense of individual democratic rights.", "model": "gemini-2.5-flash", "generated_at": "2025-06-22T13:28:18.370577", "source_hash": "774e2087cd5f137bd54221942442b4d0ac3b605d0e72f352e803521a4252a5e1", "raw_response_path": "data/llm_responses/LEX3437__short_index__left_leaning__20250622T132818.json", "output_tokens": 170, "prompt_tokens": 1247, "total_tokens": 1984, "summary_length": 1074}}, "right_leaning": {"overall": {"text": "As a right-leaning analyst, a review of these FOI documents from the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) reveals an institution deeply focused on internal controls, efficiency, and the integrity of the electoral process, largely aligning with conservative principles, though with some notable deviations.\n\n**Economic Efficiency:**\nThe documents emphasize **\"efficient delivery of polling services\"** and the AEC's commitment to **\"quality, agility, and professionalism.\"** The \"Every Task Matters\" principle and detailed \"Ballot Paper Principles\" highlight a commitment to precision and accountability, which, if executed well, contribute to overall efficiency by preventing costly errors and maintaining public trust. The structured induction and training, while extensive (up to 5 months for some staff), employs a \"70:20:10 model\" that prioritizes on-the-job learning (70%), a pragmatic approach that can be more efficient than purely formal training. Service level standards for public engagement (e.g., phones answered within 90 seconds, emails within 5 days) demonstrate an intent for responsiveness and efficiency in public service. Rigorous adherence to policies preventing fraud and misuse of Commonwealth resources (as outlined in Code of Conduct and PGPA Act) directly supports fiscal responsibility and efficient use of taxpayer money.\n\n**Individual Liberty:**\nThe AEC documents demonstrate a strong commitment to protecting **individual privacy**, particularly regarding elector information. The \"Privacy Act 1988\" and \"Australian Privacy Principles\" are repeatedly cited, with strict rules against unauthorized access or disclosure of personal data, including medical information and details of friends/colleagues. This aligns well with conservative emphasis on privacy rights and limited government intrusion into personal affairs. Employees are also afforded **procedural fairness** in misconduct investigations, including the right to make statements and have a support person.\n\nHowever, a significant deviation from individual liberty principles is the **mandatory COVID-19 vaccination policy** as a condition of engagement. This governmental requirement for personal health decisions raises concerns about bodily autonomy and potential overreach. Additionally, the strict requirement for staff to **\"maintain political neutrality\"** and avoid \"publicly engag[ing] in political activities\" could be viewed as an infringement on an individual's right to free speech and political expression outside of official duties, especially if broadly interpreted to include \"perception.\" While electoral integrity demands impartiality, the breadth of this restriction warrants scrutiny.\n\n**National Security:**\nThe overarching theme of **\"Electoral Integrity\"** is a critical component of national security. The documents repeatedly stress the importance of an \"impartial and independent electoral system,\" the \"sanctity of the ballot paper,\" \"active electoral roll management,\" and the prevention of fraud. Requirements for **Australian citizenship** and satisfactory **character clearances** (national police checks) for employees directly contribute to ensuring a trustworthy workforce in a sensitive government agency. Extensive training on \"Protective Security Awareness,\" \"IT Security,\" and \"Fraud Awareness,\" along with protocols for handling threats, all underscore a robust approach to safeguarding the democratic process from internal and external compromise, which is foundational to national security.\n\n**Fiscal Responsibility:**\nThe AEC exhibits a strong commitment to **fiscal responsibility** through its emphasis on adherence to the \"Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Act 2013 (PGPA Act),\" the \"APS Code of Conduct,\" and internal \"Accountable Authority Instructions.\" These frameworks aim to prevent the **\"misapplication, or improper dispos[al] of or use, public money,\"** and explicitly criminalize theft, fraud, and bribery. The internal procedures for determining breaches of conduct and imposing \"proportionate\" sanctions are designed to ensure accountability and proper use of resources. The screening process for re-employing individuals who received previous Commonwealth redundancy benefits also reflects a commitment to preventing wasteful spending.\n\n**Limited Government:**\nThe AEC's role as an **\"independent statutory authority\"** tasked with maintaining a fair and impartial electoral system inherently supports the principle of limited government by ensuring a legitimate process for citizens to choose their representatives. The strict controls over the **electoral roll data** (e.g., prohibition on its sale post-2004, and specific referrals for requests) demonstrate an understanding of the government's responsibility to manage, rather than indiscriminately disseminate, sensitive citizen information. The detailed policies and procedures governing employee conduct, resource use, and public engagement also aim to ensure transparent and accountable governance.\n\nHowever, the intensive internal regulatory framework, including lengthy induction programs and detailed behavioral guidelines, combined with the mandatory COVID-19 vaccination policy, could be seen as a tendency towards **over-regulation and bureaucratic expansion** that, if not constantly re-evaluated for efficiency and necessity, could subtly undermine the spirit of limited government.", "model": "gemini-2.5-flash", "generated_at": "2025-06-22T13:28:51.857187", "source_hash": "774e2087cd5f137bd54221942442b4d0ac3b605d0e72f352e803521a4252a5e1", "raw_response_path": "data/llm_responses/LEX3437__overall__right_leaning__20250622T132851.json", "output_tokens": 967, "prompt_tokens": 46785, "total_tokens": 52341, "summary_length": 5413}, "short_index": {"text": "From a right-leaning perspective, the Australian Electoral Commission's FOI documents portray an institution largely aligned with conservative principles, exhibiting a robust commitment to economic efficiency, fiscal responsibility via adherence to the PGPA Act, and strong national security through safeguarding electoral integrity, preventing fraud, and vetting staff.

This policy extends AEC control beyond work duties into employees' private lives, effectively stifling free speech and encouraging self-censorship for job security.\n    *   The \"Letter of Engagement\" explicitly makes adherence to the AEC's COVID-19 Vaccination Policy a \"condition of engagement,\" with non-compliance potentially leading to termination. This represents a significant overreach into personal health decisions as a requirement for government employment.\n\n2.  **Bureaucratic Inefficiency and High Overhead:**\n    *   The \"National Induction Program\" is an extensive, multi-phase, five-month program for new staff, replete with \"modules,\" \"check-in points,\" \"local induction advisers\" (a \"voluntary role\" implying reliance on unpaid goodwill), and various mandatory e-learning courses. This suggests a significant bureaucratic investment in internal \"culture\" and \"values\" alignment, potentially diverting resources from core electoral functions.\n    *   The \"Public Engagement Team Handbook\" details highly inefficient manual processes. Staff are required to manually check \"Personal Message Manager (PMM)\" spam filters for *three* shared mailboxes *daily*, indicating either poor automated systems or excessive caution absorbing significant staff time.\n    *   Changing automated public information messages (IVR for the 13 23 26 number) requires submitting an IT request with \"a week's notice,\" demonstrating a slow and cumbersome process for critical public communication updates.\n    *   The compilation of \"Complaints Management Reports\" is an intensely manual and complex process, involving specific Excel filters, and warnings against common data manipulation errors, highlighting significant bureaucratic overhead and a system prone to human error, consuming considerable staff hours.\n    *   Even essential services like interpreter calls face bureaucratic hurdles, requiring annual \"Spending Approval forms\" and detailed invoice checks \"to ensure it does not exceed the spending approval amount,\" showing a focus on micro-managing costs over seamless service delivery.\n\n3.  **Lack of Transparency and Information Control:**\n    *   While the FOI request explicitly asked for \"Memoranda of understanding setting out arrangements for liaison between the AEC and the Australian Federal Police,\" these documents are conspicuously absent from the \"SCHEDULE OF RELEASED DOCUMENTS,\" raising serious concerns about a lack of transparency regarding inter-agency operations, particularly concerning policing and information sharing.\n    *   The AEC's shift in policy regarding the electoral roll, where it was \"freely available for purchase\" pre-2004 but \"prohibited from sale\" and \"no longer provided to libraries\" post-2004, indicates a clear move towards greater restriction of public access to historical and current electoral data.\n    *   All \"Freedom of Information (FOI) Requests\" must be funneled through the \"Legal Services mailbox,\" adding an extra layer of bureaucracy and potentially delaying responses or limiting direct access to information handlers.\n    *   The \"AEC Procedures for Determining Breaches of the APS Code of Conduct\" states that \"A formal hearing is not required\" for misconduct determinations, reducing transparency and due process for employees accused of breaches. Furthermore, the record of determination is subject to the \"Privacy Act 1988,\" limiting public accountability for internal misconduct.\n\nIn summary, these documents paint a picture of a government agency prioritizing internal control, rigid compliance, and bureaucratic process over agile operations and open information practices, raising questions about potential waste, stifling of dissent, and a general lack of external accountability.", "model": "gemini-2.5-flash", "generated_at": "2025-06-22T13:29:24.295372", "source_hash": "774e2087cd5f137bd54221942442b4d0ac3b605d0e72f352e803521a4252a5e1", "raw_response_path": "data/llm_responses/LEX3437__overall__government_skeptic__20250622T132924.json", "output_tokens": 826, "prompt_tokens": 46781, "total_tokens": 50899, "summary_length": 4383}, "short_index": {"text": "From a government skeptic's viewpoint, the AEC documents paint a picture of an organization deeply entrenched in bureaucratic control and internal processes, prioritizing these over efficiency and public transparency.

Operational inefficiency abounds, with multi-month induction programs, manual spam checks, and cumbersome update processes indicating wasteful resource allocation.

This is further reinforced by the comprehensive 'Acknowledgement and Declaration of Key Obligations' and the 'Letter of Engagement' for new employees, which clearly articulate the critical importance of political neutrality, conflict of interest avoidance, and adherence to all relevant legislation, including the Public Service Act and the Privacy Act, from day one.\n\nThe government's dedication to **professionalism and service excellence** in public engagement is a recurring theme. The 'APS1 Induction and Training Booklet' and the 'Public Engagement Team Handbook' (November 2022) showcase robust training programs grounded in the AEC's core values of Electoral Integrity, Quality, Agility, and Professionalism. Staff are rigorously trained in handling public inquiries, managing challenging interactions (as highlighted by the 'Dealing with Difficult Behaviour' intranet page), and adhering to strict service level standards. The provision of interpreter services and the National Relay Service underscores a proactive commitment to ensuring accessible and equitable service for all citizens.\n\nA significant emphasis is placed on **data security and privacy**, with stringent protocols detailed to protect sensitive electoral and personal information.

The \"Public Engagement Team Handbook\" details how *incoming* calls are filtered and how staff can *use* interpreter services, but not how *staff are prohibited or restricted from initiating calls*. This is a clear evasion of the request, suggesting either an absence of such policies or a deliberate withholding.\n*   **Damning Implication:** The complete absence of any AFP Memoranda of Understanding (MOUs) is highly concerning. Given the AEC's role in maintaining electoral integrity, the lack of formal, documented arrangements with the federal police for sharing information or handling complaints about potential breaches of electoral law implies either gross negligence, an intention to handle all such matters internally without external oversight, or a deliberate refusal to disclose these critical documents under FOI. This suggests a system designed to shield the AEC from external investigation and accountability.\n\n**Culture of Fear, Control, and Distrust:**\n\n*   **Political Neutrality as Thought Control:** The \"Acknowledgement and Declaration of Key Obligations\" and \"Letter of Engagement\" impose extreme conditions on staff political neutrality, requiring them to declare they are \"not currently publicly active in political affairs\" and will not \"publicly engage in such activities.\" The use of \"perception that the person is involved with such activity\" as a basis for \"sanction, including termination\" is an alarming overreach, designed to chill legitimate civic engagement and force self-censorship, extending the AEC's control into employees' private lives, especially via social media.\n*   **Pervasive Surveillance and Disproportionate Liability:** The \"APS1 Induction and training booklet\" explicitly states, \"The AEC actively monitors computer and systems usage,\" and warns of \"significant consequences for any breach, including the possibility of legal proceedings.\" Employees are \"personally responsible for securing your login and password details, and for all activity on the systems undertaken using your login.\" This creates an environment of pervasive surveillance and places extreme personal liability on staff for actions that could be due to systemic vulnerabilities or genuine errors, fostering a climate of fear rather than trust.\n*   **Micro-management and Internal Policing:** The \"APS1 Induction and training booklet\" and \"Public Engagement Team Handbook\" are replete with micro-managing instructions, from email etiquette (\"Do not write in UPPERCASE or bold\") to strict privacy rules (\"You must never look up a friend or colleague\u2019s address\"). The directive to report colleagues (\"If you become aware that a staff member is mishandling personal information... report the matter to a senior officer as soon as you can\") fosters an internal \"snitch\" culture, undermining collegiality and trust.\n*   **Barriers to Public Access:** The \"Public Engagement Team Handbook\" details strict protocols for public contact, including not transferring calls from the public to Senior Executive Staff (requiring a message to be taken instead) and extreme secrecy around staff contact details (\"You may not confirm any of the following information to a caller: whether a person works for the AEC, a person\u2019s work number, a person\u2019s email address\"). This creates an opaque barrier between the public and senior AEC officials, insulating the leadership from direct scrutiny.\n\n**Incompetence and Negligence in Staff Management and Training:**\n\n*   **Outdated Policies and Neglect:** The \"AEC Procedures for Determining Breaches of the APS Code of Conduct and Sanctions\" document is dated December 2018, with a \"Next review date\" of November 2019. Its outdated status, despite more recent documents being provided, indicates a significant organizational neglect of critical internal governance and staff accountability frameworks.\n*   **Exploitative and Inadequate Training for Frontline Staff:**\n    *   The \"APS1 Induction and training booklet\" reveals heavy reliance on casual APS1 staff for \"peak workload periods\" and core \"administrative and processing support,\" demanding work \"at short notice\" and \"a number of weekends.\" This is a clear indicator of under-resourcing and exploitative practices towards temporary employees, who are placed under immense pressure.\n    *   Crucially, the \"National Induction Program: Outline\" explicitly states, \"APS1 and staff identified to fill key election specific roles are outside scope for this program.\" This creates a glaring two-tiered system where the most vulnerable, high-turnover, and often public-facing staff (APS1s) are deliberately excluded from the \"nationally consistent induction\" deemed essential for other levels. This exposes them to inadequate training and support for critical electoral functions, severely compromising their ability to perform effectively and reliably.\n    *   The reliance on a \"70:20:10 learning model\" means only 10% of training is \"structured,\" pushing the burden of learning onto \"experience\" and \"others.\" For casual, excluded APS1 staff, this means insufficient formal training and reliance on potentially untrained peers, setting them up for failure. The \"quality assurance processes\" that \"identify any enrolment processing errors\" for \"learning progress\" are likely to be punitive rather than supportive, shifting blame for systemic training failures onto individual staff.\n*   **Fatigue and Worker Safety Acknowledged but Unaddressed:** The \"APS1 Induction and training booklet\" chillingly admits, \"Fatigue is an ever-present risk in the AEC... and can't always be prevented, but must always be managed.\" This is an admission of failure to adequately protect staff from known occupational hazards, particularly given the reliance on casual staff for demanding, high-pressure election periods.\n\n**Concealment of Legal Breaches and Systemic Secrecy:**\n\n*   **Internal Control of Complaints and Fraud:** The \"Public Engagement Team Handbook\" directs \"Complaints of possible breaches of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918, and/or other Commonwealth legislation, such as the Privacy Act 1988,\" to the \"Chief Legal Officer in our Legal Services area\" and \"All potential cases of enrolment fraud should now be forwarded to RMCE in the first instance.\"\n*   **Damning Implication:** This explicitly centralizes the handling of potential criminal offenses and legal breaches *within* the AEC's internal legal and fraud teams, rather than immediately involving external law enforcement like the AFP. The lack of any disclosed AFP MOUs, combined with this internal triage mechanism, strongly suggests a deliberate policy of managing, containing, and potentially concealing allegations of legal misconduct and fraud internally, thereby avoiding external scrutiny, prosecution, and accountability. This is a profound failure of public duty and a direct threat to the integrity of the electoral process.\n*   **Restrictive Data Access:** The policy on electoral roll data, stating it is \"exempt from the FOI Act\" and that \"The AEC does not have publicly-available historic rolls,\" further highlights a culture of secrecy regarding fundamental electoral information.\n\nIn conclusion, the documents reveal an AEC that prioritizes control, internal management of potentially criminal conduct, and extreme political neutrality at the expense of staff well-being, transparency, and robust external accountability. The systemic exclusion and inadequate training of frontline casual staff, coupled with an oppressive oversight environment, paints a damning picture of a commission seemingly more concerned with self-preservation and image control than with open governance and the welfare of its most vulnerable employees.", "model": "gemini-2.5-flash", "generated_at": "2025-06-22T13:30:46.404496", "source_hash": "774e2087cd5f137bd54221942442b4d0ac3b605d0e72f352e803521a4252a5e1", "raw_response_path": "data/llm_responses/LEX3437__overall__highly_critical__20250622T133046.json", "output_tokens": 1638, "prompt_tokens": 46782, "total_tokens": 54669, "summary_length": 8600}, "short_index": {"text": "The FOI request documents expose the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) not as a guardian of democracy, but as a Kafkaesque bureaucracy obsessed with internal control, riddled with fear, and designed to evade transparency and external accountability.

This pervasive secrecy is reinforced by an oppressive internal culture that demands extreme political neutrality bordering on thought control, employs intrusive surveillance and micro-management, and erects formidable barriers between the public and its senior officials, fostering an environment of distrust and discouraging legitimate civic engagement.
