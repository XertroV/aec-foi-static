      <h2>FOI Request Summary: LEX3041</h2>
<p>This summary addresses FOI Request No. LEX3041, focusing on "foreign objects" in ballot boxes and the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC)'s procedural responses.</p>
<h3>Main Purpose of FOI Request</h3>
<p>The request sought two primary pieces of information:<br />
1.  <strong>A list of identifiers and descriptions</strong> of "foreign objects" (defined as "all objects received in ballot boxes that were not ballots").<br />
2.  <strong>The current 'playbooks'</strong> that the AEC use, including pre-established methods and procedures, for responding to a "foreign object" in a ballot box.</p>
<h3>Documents from FOI Request</h3>
<p>The following documents were released in response to the request:<br />
*   <strong>Static OIC Election Procedures Handbook</strong> (Date: N/A)<br />
*   <strong>Prematurely Opened Ballot Box Policy</strong> (Date: 09/2021)<br />
*   <strong>Prematurely Opened Ballot Box SOP</strong> (Date: 07/2020)</p>
<h3>Main Content Related to the FOI Request</h3>
<p><strong>1. Foreign Objects in Ballot Boxes:</strong><br />
*   <strong>Definition:</strong> The FOI request explicitly defines "foreign objects" as "all objects received in ballot boxes that were not ballots."<br />
*   <strong>AEC Guidance:</strong><br />
    *   The <strong>Election Procedures Handbook</strong> (Page 5) directly addresses the scenario of a voter dropping a "personal something" into a ballot box: "although it may be distressing for a voter if they have dropped something personal into the ballot box, you must never open the ballot box to retrieve it as the integrity of the result is first priority."<br />
    *   This highlights that the primary procedural response to such a "foreign object" (specifically, a personal item) is <strong>non-retrieval</strong> due to the paramount importance of electoral integrity.<br />
*   <strong>Absence of Listing/Description Procedures:</strong> The provided documents do not contain procedures or forms for listing identifiers or descriptions of non-ballot "foreign objects" that may be received in ballot boxes. The focus is on preventing retrieval and maintaining ballot box integrity.</p>
<p><strong>2. Procedural Response 'Playbooks':</strong><br />
*   The three documents provided (Election Procedures Handbook, Prematurely Opened Ballot Box Policy, and Prematurely Opened Ballot Box SOP) serve as the AEC's "playbooks" for ballot box procedures.<br />
*   <strong>Election Procedures Handbook:</strong> As noted above, this handbook explicitly states the procedural response to personal items dropped into ballot boxes: they are not to be retrieved, prioritizing "integrity of the result."<br />
*   <strong>Prematurely Opened Ballot Box Policy &amp; SOP:</strong> These documents outline detailed procedures for instances where a ballot box is opened <em>prematurely</em> (i.e., before the legislated time frame). This includes scenarios where:<br />
    *   A ballot box containing ordinary ballot papers or declaration vote envelopes is opened before the prescribed time.<br />
    *   A ballot box is discovered to have been opened prematurely.<br />
    *   Seal numbers on a ballot box do not match records and the discrepancy cannot be explained.<br />
    *   A cardboard ballot box splits or comes open, and ballot papers are spilt.<br />
*   <strong>Focus on Ballot Integrity:</strong> The Policy and SOP are designed to investigate and manage the impact of premature openings on the <strong>ballot papers and declaration vote envelopes</strong> contained within, determining whether they should be included or excluded from scrutiny. They do not detail procedures for recording or managing non-ballot "foreign objects" beyond the general instruction in the Election Procedures Handbook to not open the box to retrieve personal items. The guiding principle for all ballot box handling is maintaining the "integrity of the result."</p>

    <div class="ai-summary-markdown-content">
      <p>These FOI documents, comprising the Australian Electoral Commission's (AEC) Election Procedures Handbook and policies/SOPs on prematurely opened ballot boxes, reveal a strong operational alignment with several progressive values, particularly social justice and civil liberties. Environmental impact and direct considerations of wealth/corporate influence are less prominent, though addressed indirectly.</p>
<p><strong>Social Justice &amp; Civil Liberties: Strong Alignment</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Voter Enfranchisement as Paramount:</strong> The documents explicitly prioritize "prevention of voter disenfranchisement" and the "integrity of the result" above other concerns like customer service (EPH p.5). This is a core progressive value, ensuring every eligible citizen's right to vote is protected.</li>
<li><strong>Equitable Access and Non-Discrimination:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>COVID-19 Measures:</strong> Crucially, polling staff are instructed <em>not</em> to enforce COVID-19 safety measures to the extent of "denying the franchise of any Australian citizen who is eligible to vote" (EPH p.6). This demonstrates a clear commitment to civil liberties over strict compliance where the two might conflict.</li>
<li><strong>Assisted Voting:</strong> Detailed procedures ensure voters requiring assistance due to physical injury, disability, low literacy, or diverse linguistic backgrounds receive help (EPH p.58-60). This includes allowing nominated assistants (friends, family, even party workers <em>if nominated</em>), AEC staff, and interpreters, actively promoting inclusivity.</li>
<li><strong>Respectful Communication:</strong> A dedicated section emphasizes treating people with disabilities and those from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds with respect, avoiding condescension, and offering appropriate support (EPH p.60-62).</li>
<li><strong>Queue Management:</strong> Instructions to queue controllers specifically mention "escorting elderly and frail voters to the head of the queue" (EPH p.17), indicating a practical approach to accessibility.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Upholding Voter Intent:</strong> The comprehensive "Ballot Paper Formality Guide" (EPH Attachment 2) operates on the principle to "Start from the assumption that the voter has intended to vote formally" and to "Err in favour of the franchise." This approach aims to maximize the count of votes, even if imperfectly marked, directly supporting the democratic will.</li>
<li><strong>Protection Against Disenfranchisement from Errors:</strong> The policy for "Prematurely Opened Ballot Box" and its SOP (SOP 4.2) state that the Australian Electoral Officer (AEO) <em>must</em> decide to include ballot papers "unless the AEO is satisfied that the ballot paper has been fraudulently altered or otherwise interfered with so as not to reflect the voter’s intention." This places a high bar for exclusion, protecting votes even in compromised circumstances, further reinforcing voter enfranchisement.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Wealth Distribution &amp; Corporate Influence: Indirect Alignment</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Anti-Corruption Measures:</strong> The "Polling place offences" (EPH Attachment 5) list severe penalties for "Bribery" (s.326), "Interference with political liberty" (s.327), and "Misleading or deceptive publications" (s.329). These legal safeguards aim to prevent illicit financial or undue influence from wealthy individuals or corporations from distorting the electoral process.</li>
<li><strong>Neutrality and Secrecy:</strong> Prohibitions on polling officers and scrutineers displaying political affiliations (s.341) and the strict adherence to voter secrecy (s.323) ensure that the voting environment is neutral and free from overt pressure, which could otherwise be leveraged by powerful entities.</li>
<li><strong>Canvassing Restrictions:</strong> The 6-meter exclusion zone for canvassing around polling places (s.340) limits direct, last-minute political campaigning, which often relies on well-funded party workers, thus reducing direct, immediate pressure on voters.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Environmental Impact: Minimal Mention</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Hygiene and Waste Management:</strong> The documents briefly mention "sanitising spray," "paper towels," "extra bin liners," and a "dedicated PPE bin" (EPH p.23, 36). While necessary for public health, the materials described are largely single-use, with no apparent emphasis on broader environmental sustainability, recycling initiatives, or reducing the carbon footprint of election administration. This indicates environmental impact is not a primary focus within these specific operational guidelines.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Civil Liberties: Areas of Potential Nuance</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Compulsory Voting:</strong> While a cornerstone of Australian democracy and often supported by progressive movements for ensuring broad participation, compulsory voting (s.245) inherently restricts the civil liberty of choosing <em>not</em> to vote. The documents do not debate this but clearly outline the procedural requirement for voters to mark and deposit their ballot to fulfill this obligation (EPH Attachment 5, p.121).</li>
<li><strong>Omission of "Foreign Objects" List:</strong> The FOI request specifically asked for "A list of the identifiers of foreign objects received in ballot boxes." While the documents explain <em>why</em> such objects are not retrieved (integrity of the ballot is paramount, EPH p.5), the actual list itself was omitted. For a left-leaning analyst, this minor omission could be seen as a missed opportunity for full transparency, potentially revealing insights into voter engagement, protests, or even system-level issues, though the AEC's rationale for non-retrieval and non-disclosure (beyond the procedural) is not provided here.</li>
</ol>
<p>In conclusion, the AEC's operational documents largely align with progressive values by emphasizing the integrity, accessibility, and fairness of the electoral process, prioritizing the individual's right to vote and protecting it from undue influence or error. While direct environmental considerations are minimal, and the implications of compulsory voting are a broader societal debate, the detailed procedures reflect a strong commitment to core democratic principles crucial for social justice and civil liberties.</p>

    <div class="ai-summary-markdown-content">
      <p>The provided Freedom of Information (FOI) documents, including the Election Procedures Handbook (EPH), Prematurely Opened Ballot Box Policy, and Standard Operating Procedure (SOP), offer a detailed look into the operational intricacies of the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC). From a right-leaning analytical perspective, these documents reveal both commendable alignments with conservative principles and notable deviations.</p>
<p><strong>Alignment with Conservative Principles:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>National Security &amp; Election Integrity:</strong> The paramount focus on "Integrity of the result" and the explicit emphasis on "Safe custody and handling of ballot papers" (EPH p. 5) strongly align with national security interests in safeguarding the democratic process. Strict protocols for securing ballot boxes, establishing "secure zones" for materials (EPH p. 27), and continuous supervision underscore a commitment to preventing fraud and maintaining the sanctity of the vote. The detailed procedures for managing "prematurely opened ballot boxes" (Policy/SOP) further reinforce an institutional dedication to investigating and mitigating potential breaches, promoting public trust in election outcomes. Robust rules against canvassing too close to polling places, misleading publications, and voter impersonation (Attachment 5) directly protect the integrity of individual voting choices from undue influence.</li>
<li><strong>Individual Liberty (Voter's Franchise):</strong> The AEC's commitment to "Maintaining integrity of a person’s right to vote (prevention of voter disenfranchisement)" (EPH p. 5) and ensuring voter anonymity through strict ballot secrecy measures (EPH p. 52) are crucial for individual liberty. Provisions for assisted voting for those with disabilities or language barriers also demonstrate a commitment to universal access to the franchise.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Deviations from Conservative Principles:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Limited Government &amp; Economic Efficiency:</strong> The sheer volume and prescriptive nature of the Election Procedures Handbook (137 pages of minute detail) point to an expansive, highly centralized, and bureaucratic approach to election management. Every aspect, from staff roles (OIC, 2IC, PPLO, Queue Controller, Hygiene Officer, Ballot Box Guard, Inquiry Officer, Scrutiny Assistant) to the precise placement of tape on floors, is meticulously dictated. This level of micromanagement suggests a significant governmental footprint in electoral operations, potentially sacrificing local autonomy and agility for rigid uniformity.<ul>
<li><strong>Fiscal Responsibility &amp; COVID-19 Measures:</strong> The extensive COVID-19 safety measures (1.5m distancing, capacity limits, mandatory staff vaccination, regular touchpoint cleaning, dedicated "Hygiene Officers," provision of PPE, sanitiser, and extra bins) impose substantial additional costs and operational overhead. While presented as health and safety imperatives, these measures represent a significant increase in public expenditure and administrative complexity. A conservative perspective would question the economic efficiency of such prescriptive and resource-intensive interventions, especially if less costly alternatives could achieve similar health outcomes without sacrificing operational agility or fiscal prudence.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Individual Liberty (Staff):</strong> The requirement for all polling staff to be "fully vaccinated or have an approved medical exemption" (EPH p. 6, 13) represents a clear infringement on individual medical liberty for those employed by the AEC. While the policy states voters cannot be denied their franchise for COVID-19 non-compliance (EPH p. 6), this double standard for staff reflects a governmental overreach into personal health decisions for its employees. Furthermore, the detailed regulation of staff breaks and the obligation for employees to adhere to them, even under threat of work health and safety legislation breach (EPH p. 85-86), can be seen as excessive government intervention in employment conditions.</li>
</ul>
<p>In conclusion, while the documents showcase a strong dedication to the integrity and security of the electoral process, core conservative tenets, they also illustrate a tendency towards expansive government bureaucracy and potentially inefficient allocation of resources, particularly magnified by the extensive COVID-19 protocols that impinge on individual liberties of electoral staff.</p>

    <div class="ai-summary-markdown-content">
      <p>These FOI documents reveal a government agency (AEC) deeply entrenched in procedural minutiae, yet strikingly opaque regarding actual incidents, raising significant concerns for any skeptic.</p>
<p>The most glaring omission is the complete absence of the requested "list of identifiers of foreign objects received in ballot boxes" and their descriptions. Despite the explicit FOI request, this crucial data was not provided, suggesting either a concerning failure to record such incidents, or a deliberate lack of transparency in disclosing them. The Election Procedures Handbook (EPH) even acknowledges that voters drop "something personal into the ballot box," explicitly directing staff to <em>never</em> open the box to retrieve it, prioritizing "integrity of the result" over citizen property. This confirms that "foreign objects" are a known, recurring issue, yet the data on <em>what</em> these objects are, and <em>how often</em> they occur, remains hidden.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the documents expose questionable resource allocation and decision-making:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Insecure Ballot Boxes:</strong> Despite their central role in elections, cardboard and polypropylene "ballot boxes" are explicitly labeled as "not a secure container." This inherent insecurity necessitates the constant presence of a "ballot box guard" and strict procedures for "prematurely opened ballot boxes." This points to an inefficient use of human resources to compensate for fundamentally inadequate equipment, rather than investing in more secure infrastructure. The fact that the Prematurely Opened Ballot Box Policy and SOP are necessary at all, and include scenarios like boxes "splitting" or seals "coming off," underscores this vulnerability.</li>
<li><strong>Bureaucratic Over-engineering and Waste:</strong> The sheer volume and prescriptive detail of the EPH (137 pages) and supporting SOPs demonstrate an excessive reliance on process. While some structure is necessary, the granular instructions – down to sanitizing pencils, voting screens every 10-15 minutes, and mandating double-lined PPE bins – suggest an over-engineered response, potentially leading to significant time and resource drain with questionable real-world impact. This level of micro-management can stifle efficiency and waste taxpayer money on disproportionately high compliance costs.</li>
<li><strong>Voter Roll Inaccuracies and Disenfranchisement Risks:</strong> The procedures for handling voters whose names "cannot be found" on the certified list, or are "already marked as having voted," expose potential systemic inaccuracies in the electoral roll. The requirement for "Elector information reports" to document "errors," "spelt incorrectly" names, "inaccurate address details," or names appearing "twice" on the list, highlights a recurring problem that could lead to voter disenfranchisement or, conversely, opportunities for fraudulent voting if not meticulously managed.</li>
<li><strong>Subjective Authority Over Ballots:</strong> The "Prematurely Opened Ballot Box SOP" grants the Australian Electoral Officer (AEO) the power to "decide whether ballot papers are to be included or excluded from scrutiny" if a box is opened prematurely. This introduces a subjective layer of authority, allowing a single official to determine the fate of ballots based on their satisfaction that a ballot "has not been fraudulently altered." This discretionary power, particularly in a high-stakes scenario, could be perceived as a vulnerability to abuse or unscrutinized decision-making that influences election outcomes.</li>
<li><strong>Shifted Liability:</strong> The AEC explicitly states it "accepts no responsibility for the loss of property belonging to employees or for damage to their vehicles." While standard, in the context of temporary government employment, this highlights the agency's willingness to offload risk onto its casual workforce, despite the critical national service they provide.</li>
</ul>
<p>In summary, these documents paint a picture of an agency that prioritizes bureaucratic control and procedural adherence, even at the cost of transparency, efficient resource management, and direct responsiveness to citizen issues, while simultaneously revealing inherent vulnerabilities in its physical security protocols and data integrity. The unfulfilled FOI request for "foreign object" data remains a significant red flag for accountability.</p>

      <p>The released FOI documents offer a reassuring look into the meticulous and robust processes underpinning our electoral system, demonstrating the government's unwavering commitment to fair, secure, and accessible elections.</p>
<p>The <strong>Election Procedures Handbook</strong> highlights a comprehensive framework for effective polling day operations, emphasizing several key principles: the paramount integrity of election results, the efficiency of processes, and a strong focus on positive customer service. It details the extensive training and clear roles for all polling officials, from the Officer-in-Charge to hygiene officers, ensuring a consistently high standard of service. Proactive measures, such as the detailed COVID-19 safety protocols, underscore the government's dedication to public health and safety, seamlessly integrating these into existing procedures to protect voters and staff. The handbook also outlines rigorous ballot paper handling protocols, from secure storage to precise issuance and meticulous reconciliation, safeguarding the sanctity of every vote. Furthermore, provisions for assisted voting and clear communication guidelines ensure that all citizens, including those with disabilities or from diverse backgrounds, can exercise their democratic right with full support.</p>
<p>The documents also provide a clear view of how the system effectively manages unforeseen challenges. For instance, the <strong>Prematurely Opened Ballot Box Policy</strong> and its accompanying <strong>Standard Operating Procedure</strong> lay out a rigorous, multi-layered response to a potentially sensitive issue. Rather than causing alarm, these procedures demonstrate an exceptional commitment to electoral integrity. Should a ballot box be opened prematurely—a rare occurrence—it triggers an immediate, formal investigation led by the Australian Electoral Officer (AEO). This process is designed not to invalidate votes, but to thoroughly examine the circumstances, ensuring that legitimate ballot papers and declaration envelopes are, wherever possible, included in the scrutiny. The AEO's primary directive is to include votes unless clear evidence of fraudulent alteration is present, a testament to the system's inherent trust in the voter's intention and a commitment to preventing disenfranchisement. This meticulous approach, involving detailed reporting, secure custody, and transparent reconciliation, ensures that every effort is made to uphold the voter's franchise while maintaining the highest standards of security and accountability.</p>
<p>In essence, these documents showcase a government dedicated to proactive governance, necessary regulation, and positive outcomes, ensuring that every election is conducted with the utmost integrity, efficiency, and public trust.</p>

    <div class="ai-summary-markdown-content">
      <p>The FOI response itself immediately signals a lack of transparency and potential incompetence. The request for "a list of the identifiers of foreign objects received in ballot boxes, and a description...where no description was noted" was entirely ignored. Instead, the AEC provided only generic procedural handbooks, suggesting either:<br />
1.  They do not track such incidents centrally, highlighting a profound failure in data collection and accountability for electoral integrity.<br />
2.  They possess the information but deliberately withheld it, indicating an active effort to conceal the extent of foreign objects compromising ballot boxes.<br />
3.  The "playbooks" provided are <em>not</em> a "procedural response to a foreign object," but specifically to a "prematurely opened ballot box," sidestepping the core of the request regarding <em>what</em> foreign objects are found and how <em>they</em> are dealt with, implying a systemic blind spot or cover-up for non-ballot contaminants.</p>
<p><strong>Damning Implications from the Election Procedures Handbook (EPH):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Hypocrisy of Stated Principles:</strong> The Electoral Commissioner’s message boasts of Australia's system being "one of the fairest and most open" with a focus on "trusted, consistently reliable, high quality, high integrity elections," claiming "no exceptions" to strictly followed procedures. This self-congratulatory rhetoric is immediately and brutally undermined by the subsequent content.</li>
<li><strong>Prioritizing Appearance Over Actual Integrity:</strong> The EPH explicitly states (Page 5), "although it may be distressing for a voter if they have dropped something personal into the ballot box, you must never open the ballot box to retrieve it as the integrity of the result is first priority." This is a monumental admission of a flawed integrity model. It prioritizes the <em>unbroken seal</em> of the ballot box over the <em>actual contents</em> of the box. This policy is a glaring vulnerability:<ul>
<li>It allows for the deliberate insertion of <em>any</em> foreign object (e.g., electronic devices, propaganda, materials intended to spoil votes, or even bio-hazards) into a ballot box with no immediate mechanism for detection or removal.</li>
<li>It suggests that the "integrity of the result" is maintained by <em>not knowing</em> if the contents are compromised, effectively sweeping potential contamination or tampering under the rug. This is a policy of willful ignorance.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Fundamental Security Weaknesses:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>"Ballot boxes are cardboard or moulded plastic... Although they are sealed, they are not a secure container, and should not be left unattended in public view at any time." (Page 26)</strong> This is an astonishing confession. The primary repository of votes is openly admitted to be "not a secure container." This highlights a catastrophic failure in fundamental security design, exposing the entire voting process to compromise through simple theft or tampering. Relying on continuous human "guarding" (Page 16) is a weak and fallible substitute for secure containers.</li>
<li><strong>"Ballot papers... must be kept in a secure zone... visible to the OIC but not readily accessible to the public." (Page 27)</strong> "Not readily accessible" is not "secure." This is a low bar for protecting the most sensitive election material.</li>
<li><strong>"Transport containers must remain closed but do not need to be sealed during polling." (Page 27)</strong> This creates a massive window of opportunity for tampering or theft of unallocated ballot papers, as they are unsecured for the entire polling day.</li>
<li><strong>"Leaving ballot papers or certified lists in a vehicle overnight is strictly prohibited." (Page 27)</strong> This explicit prohibition implies a historical failure or known risk, revealing a reactive fix to a basic security oversight.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Normalization of Incompetence and Errors:</strong><ul>
<li>The document lists "Balancing errors commonly occur because of: inaccurate counting of ballot papers before polling, a miscount of unused ballot papers at the end of polling, ordinary votes placed in incorrect division’s ballot box (if a dual or multi), including discarded declaration ballot papers in the total figures, or not including the OIC’s unallocated ballot papers in the total number of unused papers." (Page 72). This isn't a "troubleshooting" list; it's a litany of fundamental, recurring failures in basic inventory management and procedural adherence that are <em>expected</em> to occur.</li>
<li>The instruction to "Do not take any more time by searching or recounting again. This will delay the release of results" (Page 72) explicitly prioritizes the speed of reporting results over achieving accurate reconciliation of ballots, directly undermining the stated principle of "Integrity of the result." This is a clear instruction to tolerate discrepancies.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Vulnerability to Duplicate Voting and Coercion:</strong><ul>
<li>If a voter's name is already marked as having voted, but they claim not to have, they are "directed to the declaration vote issuing point." (Page 48) This means the system allows for potential duplicate voting in real-time, relying on post-election "investigation" rather than real-time prevention, opening the door for systemic abuse.</li>
<li>For assisted voting, "A voter can nominate any person (except a candidate) to help them." (Page 58) This allows party workers, friends, or family members to directly assist with the marking of a ballot, opening a clear avenue for undue influence, coercion, or even direct manipulation of votes, fundamentally compromising the secrecy and freedom of the ballot for vulnerable voters. The presence of scrutineers to "observe how the ballot paper is completed" further erodes the principle of ballot secrecy for those needing assistance.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Disenfranchisement and Unaccounted Ballots:</strong> "If a voter loses a ballot paper they cannot receive a second one." (Page 56). This policy directly disenfranchises a voter who may have accidentally dropped or had their ballot stolen, without any mechanism to verify their claim or issue a replacement, while simultaneously leaving a "lost" ballot unaccounted for, creating a potential vector for fraud if that lost ballot is later misused.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Damning Implications from the Prematurely Opened Ballot Box Policy and SOP:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Deliberate Concealment of Breaches:</strong> The most egregious failure is the explicit definitional sleight-of-hand. The policy <em>narrows</em> the definition of "prematurely opened ballot box" to exclude critical integrity failures (Policy Page 3, Scenario Guide Page 4-5):<ul>
<li>"Seal on ballot box has broken or appears faulty. -&gt; No"</li>
<li>"Original seal has not been affixed to the ballot box properly. -&gt; No"</li>
<li>"When moving a cardboard ballot box, it splits or comes open, or seal comes off or pulls through cardboard. Ballot papers are not spilt. -&gt; No"<br />
This is not an oversight; it is a <strong>deliberate institutional strategy to minimize the reported incidence of compromised ballot boxes.</strong> By categorizing these incidents as "normal operations" rather than "prematurely opened," the AEC avoids the full "investigation process" and public transparency, creating a facade of higher integrity than actually exists. It implies widespread issues with the quality of seals and cardboard boxes, and/or widespread incompetence in staff procedures for securing them, which the AEC actively chooses to downplay rather than address fundamentally.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Subjective and Internal "Investigation" Processes:</strong> The AEO (Australian Electoral Officer) has the sole authority to determine if ballots from a prematurely opened box are "fraudulently altered or otherwise interfered with so as not to reflect the voter’s intention." (SOP Page 4). This subjective standard, applied by an internal official, places a high bar for exclusion, meaning any accidental contamination, non-malicious interference, or damage not provably "fraudulent" will likely still be counted. This process lacks independent oversight and transparency, allowing potentially compromised votes to be validated internally.</li>
<li><strong>Bureaucratic Prioritization Over Safety:</strong> In a COVID-19 scenario where a voter spits on a ballot paper and places it in the box, the instruction is to "ensure the incident is recorded and call the DRO. Extra precautions must be taken during the scrutiny. Instruct all officials involved in the count to wear gloves, regularly sanitise their hands and not touch their faces." (Page 99). This means the AEC <strong>knowingly allows bio-hazardous material to remain in the ballot box</strong> and exposes its staff to risk during the count, rather than having a procedure to immediately isolate or remove compromised ballots, demonstrating a profound disregard for staff safety in favor of processing all votes.</li>
</ul>
<p>In summary, the documents paint a picture of an electoral commission that prioritizes the <em>appearance</em> of integrity and the <em>expediency</em> of results over robust, independently verifiable security and accountability. There are explicit policies that allow for ballot boxes to be physically compromised without triggering a full investigation, tolerate fundamental counting errors, create pathways for undue influence on voters, and even expose staff to bio-hazards, all while maintaining a facade of being "one of the fairest and most open" systems globally. The failure to provide the requested data on "foreign objects" is a glaring testament to this culture of opacity and managed perception over genuine transparency.</p>

Message from the Electoral Commissioner 
Congratulations on being selected to be a part of our election workforce. 

Australia’s electoral system is considered to be one of the fairest and most open of any in the 
world and elections are a fundamental part of our democratic process.  

As part of the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) team, your role in this election will be 
significant. 

To maintain the confidence of Australian voters, the AEC is focused on ensuring we deliver 
trusted, consistently reliable, high quality, high integrity elections.  

This may be your first election, or you may be a veteran of many elections.  

Regardless of your level of experience, it is important you study this handbook carefully. From 
election to election procedures change. It is critical to our success that all the procedures 
detailed in this handbook are strictly followed at your polling place. There are no exceptions to 
this; should you not strictly follow the relevant procedures, it may put the election result at risk.  

The AEC has introduced a range of safety measures for voters, staff and other participants for 
the  election  due  to  the  COVID-19  pandemic.  This  includes  physical  distancing  and  hygiene 
measures that conform with federal and local health advice and are also within the legislative 
framework  of  the Commonwealth  Electoral  Act  1918.  Your  role  will  include  specific  tasks  to 
ensure these measures are implemented in polling venues. The safety of our staff, voters and 
all participants in the election remains the utmost priority for the AEC. 

All staff in the AEC have adopted the mantra ‘every task matters’ which applies to every single 
task – no matter what it is. I encourage you to also adopt this mantra in the role you are 
undertaking this election. 

I wish you every success as you help the AEC 
deliver another election and in ensuring our 
electoral processes are of the highest standard 
for all Australians.  

Tom Rogers 
Electoral Commissioner

Election delivery principles 
As a polling official, you play an important role in supporting the AEC perform its role in helping 
eligible Australians to vote. There are a number of processes that occur in order to deliver an 
election. Every task you do – no matter how small – matters. Even a minor error can have 
significant consequences. The election delivery principles summarise the key priorities for your 
role as a polling official. 

The ‘election delivery principles’ are: 

1.  Integrity of the result, which means: 

a.  Safe custody and handling of ballot papers  
b.  Maintaining integrity of a person’s right to vote (prevention of voter 

disenfranchisement) 
c.  Ballot paper formality 
2.  Efficient processes and procedures 
3.  Good customer service and positive customer experience.  

It is important to remember that all three principles are fundamentally important to your role 
but there are priorities. For example, while good customer service is very important, it should 
never come at the expense of electoral integrity, so although it may be distressing for a voter if 
they have dropped something personal into the ballot box, you must never open the ballot box 
to retrieve it as the integrity of the result is first priority. 

Watch the videos 

A series of videos which demonstrate the procedures outlined in 
this handbook is available on the AEC website.

COVID-19 safety measures for the election 
The AEC is committed to delivering the election to ensure the integrity of electoral services and 
participation, and to support the welfare of voters, staff and other participants during the 
COVID-19 pandemic environment. 

The election will be held in accordance with electoral legislation, however additional measures 
are in place for this election that implement federal and state health advice and physical 
distancing requirements. The infection-control advice the AEC is following has been provided 
by relevant federal, state and territory health authorities. Polling staff will play an important 
role in the implementation of the COVID-19 safety measures. 

The following key principles are to be followed in the polling place. You will be provided with 
parameters specific to your polling place, including the total square metres and maximum 
number of people allowed inside at one time. 

▪  1.5 metre distancing wherever possible. 
▪  Capacity limits as required by health guidance. 
▪  Regular touchpoint cleaning to take place throughout the day. 
▪  Sanitisation of hands for staff, voters and anyone entering and leaving the 

polling place, and between interactions. 

▪  Availability of personal protective equipment for staff who choose to use it. 
▪  Requirement for all staff working at a polling place to be fully vaccinated or 

have an approved medical exemption. 

It is not the role of polling place staff to ensure that voters entering the polling place comply 
with COVID-19 safety measures. Polling place staff should encourage and support voters to 
adhere to measures for the health and safety of the community, but it is not our role to enforce 
them and we cannot be seen to be denying the franchise of any Australian citizen who is 
eligible to vote.  

Procedures in this handbook that specifically relate to COVID-19 measures are marked by an 
alert icon like this: 

The officer-in-charge (OIC) basic timetable

reconciliation.  

▪  Staff prepare for and conduct scrutiny. 
▪  Results are phoned in to the Election Night Results Team. 

After scrutiny, materials are packed, OIC finalises the OIC return (EF027) and final duties are 
performed. 

Staff can leave once directed by the OIC. The OIC follows the materials return plan advised by 
the divisional office, which may include transferring custody to a Scrutiny Assistant (Return of 
Materials (RoM)). 

NOTE: The exact finish time for each polling place is not known, and can be quite late in the 
evening.

Polling official roles 

Introduction 
Polling officials are accountable to the OIC of a polling place. 

The OIC is responsible to the polling place liaison officer (PPLO) and, ultimately, the divisional 
returning officer (DRO) of an electoral division. 

The DRO is an employee of the AEC and is responsible for the electoral roll and conduct of 
electoral events for an electoral division. 

If your polling place is issuing votes for more than one Division (known as a dual or multi 
polling place), each division will operate as a separate polling place sharing the premises - with 
its own OIC and polling place staff accountable to their respective PPLO and DRO. 

Polling place liaison officer (PPLO) 
PPLOs act as agents for the DRO on polling day. They visit a group of polling places to observe 
and advise on proceedings and report back to the DRO. 

The PPLO is there to provide assistance to the OIC and ensure that polling and the scrutiny 
(counting of the ballot papers) is carried out according to the correct procedures. 

It is critical that the PPLO understands all functions of the OIC’s role as they are expected to 
assist the OIC to rectify any issues or incorrect processes they witness in the polling place. 

If a PPLO is aware of any issues or has any concerns in the lead up to polling day they should 
discuss them immediately with the divisional office.  

PPLO duties 

Prior to polling day 

Before polling day, the PPLO should: 

▪  complete online and face-to-face PPLO election training and familiarise themselves 

with the election procedures handbook  

▪  attend an election readiness briefing (the divisional office will advise PPLOs of 

session details). This will include a discussion with the DRO about the schedule of 
polling places for the day, and the likely level of assistance each OIC will need 
▪  check count all materials allocated and record the details in the PPLO Return. This 
includes counting individual Senate and the House of Representatives ballot 
papers. Note that if House of Representatives ballot papers (only) are supplied 
shrink-wrapped or padded with numbered butts, it can be assumed that each 
pack/pad contains the number of ballot papers advised on the packing slip, so only 

Election Procedures Handbook – PPLO/OIC/2IC      Page 7


--- Page 9 ---

the number of bundles need to be check counted 

▪  contact each OIC to introduce themselves and offer any assistance the OIC may 

need 

▪  ensure each OIC understands the correct procedures for securing ballot papers in 

their home, vehicle and polling place 

▪ 

review the information supplied in the PPLO Return to ensure they are aware of; 

•  vote estimates for each polling place, 

• 

the number of staff required at each polling place, 

•  PPLO instructions for polling day and night. 

▪  assist with the set-up of polling place(s) on Friday evening, where required 
▪  ensure their mobile telephone is charged. 

Polling day 

The DRO will make PPLOs aware of any local factors, expected problems and last minute 
changes. 

The DRO will advise the PPLO on a polling day schedule. This may be subject to change based 
on support needs of OICs and broader circumstances.  

The PPLO should keep in regular telephone contact with the DRO and OICs throughout the day 
and evening until all allocated polling places have returned their results and their materials to 
the out-posted centre/hub.   

Visiting polling places 

PPLOs are expected to visit each polling place twice throughout polling day and at least one 
polling place from 5:50pm to support the closing of the polling place, scrutiny and pack-up. 

The PPLO Return includes a report that must be completed each time the PPLO visits a polling 
place. This helps the AEC fulfil their responsibilities to assess the performance of each polling 
place and OIC and address any future requirements.  

PPLOs should ensure they follow COVID-safe procedures during each visit, including QR code 
check-in using the relevant state/territory’s mobile phone app, using hand sanitiser on entry 
and exit, maintaining physical distance and respecting any capacity limits.  

On polling day the PPLO should: 

introduce themselves to the OIC on entering the polling place, 

▪ 
▪  examine the OIC return and ensure that instructions are being accurately followed 

and the return is being progressively completed, 

▪  ensure the OIC has set-up and signposted a polling place ballot paper secure zone 
(secure zone) and that the ballot paper transport containers are being stored 
inside the secure zone, 

▪  ensure the layout allows for a single direction of movement through the polling 

place so that voters flow through easily with minimal crossover, 

▪  make sure mini-queues are being used where applicable, 
▪ 

if necessary, suggest to the OIC possible improvements to the polling place layout 

Election Procedures Handbook – PPLO/OIC/2IC     Page 8


--- Page 10 ---

to ensure the smooth flow of voters, 

▪  ensure the OIC has a plan in place for staff meal breaks, 
▪  ensure the OIC has a plan for the scrutiny or assist in planning if required, 

▪ 

▪ 

▪ 

▪ 

▪ 

▪ 

▪ 
▪ 
▪ 

▪ 

▪ 

▪ 

during the day gauge the capacity of the OICs in each polling place and ensure they 
are available where most needed at close of poll to help organise the scrutiny, 
discuss this with the DRO, as they will know each OIC’s previous experience, 
ensure that work health and safety, including COVID-safe, procedures are being 
implemented and followed by all staff, 
ensure that ordinary vote issuing officers are following correct procedures - 
specifically that they are asking the 3 questions, marking the certified list and 
issuing ballot papers correctly, 
ensure that declaration vote issuing officers are following the correct procedure 
when using the division finder and issuing declaration votes, 
ensure that all issuing officers are telling every voter how to fill in their ballot papers 
correctly, initialling each ballot paper, and telling voters what to do if they make a 
mistake, 
ensure that ballot papers held on issuing tables are under close supervision by the 
issuing officer or another AEC officer at all times and, if necessary, are securely 
stored by the OIC when an issuing point isn’t being used, 
ensure that all ballot boxes are being closely guarded throughout polling, 
ensure that the OIC is aware of the role and responsibilities of scrutineers, 
discuss plans with the OIC for the packaging of ballot papers and election materials 
for handover to the scrutiny assistant (RoM) to return to the location advised by the 
divisional office, 
supply additional materials to polling places and/or liaise with the out-posted centre 
staff, as required, 
supervise and support the set-up and conduct of the House of Representatives 
scrutiny, Senate count and packaging of materials as required, 
provide a written assessment of the OIC’s performance during the day. This is done 
in the Polling place visits – checklist of the PPLO Return. 

On return of results from all allocated polling places, or when instructed to do so, the PPLO 
should pack their materials and return to the out-posted centre. 

Managing issues 

PPLOs will deal with a wide range of personalities and temperaments and as such must use 
good communication and interpersonal skills to ensure that each polling place is being 
managed efficiently and consistently.  

If a staff member or OIC needs support in adhering to a particular process, the PPLO should 
approach the situation in a positive and encouraging way. Ensure that the staff member 
concerned is advised on the correct process.  

At the same time, it is important that the PPLO reports accurately on the management and 
performance of the polling place. 

Election Procedures Handbook – PPLO/OIC/2IC      Page 9


--- Page 11 ---

PPLO Return 

The PPLO Return is a set of forms that outline the general duties before and during polling. It is 
also used to track the materials received from the divisional office and those given to polling 
places throughout polling day, and includes checklists to complete during each polling place 
visit. 

List of polling places to visit 

The PPLO should contact each OIC on the list prior to polling day to ensure the OIC is prepared 
and to give them the opportunity to ask any questions.  

Check count of materials to be carried 

The divisional office will provide each PPLO with a materials inventory. The inventory is to be 
used to ensure the PPLO has received the correct quantity of materials. The PPLO should 
update their inventory list with any corrections, and contact the divisional office if they are 
missing materials or if the materials have been damaged in any way. 

Transporting ballot papers 

PPLOs may be required to carry an allocation of spare ballot papers.  

When transporting ballot papers they must be inside a sealed ballot paper transport container 
with a completed Record of security seals form placed in the plastic window on the container 
and stored out of sight in a fully enclosed, locked vehicle.   

Ballot papers that are stored in the PPLO’s home/accommodation overnight (prior to polling 
day) must be kept in a secure zone. This must be a secure area in your home that is out of 
public view and unlikely to be accessed by others.  

Distribution of election materials 

Each time the PPLO issues ballot papers to a polling place, they must take the sealed transport 
container into the polling place and open it in the presence of the OIC. The number of ballot 
papers transferred to the OIC should be counted by the PPLO on allocation, check counted by 
the OIC on receipt, and the following information recorded: 

▪  Ballot papers: Complete the Cover note for the supply/receipt of ballot papers 

form. The PPLO retains the original copy and the OIC keeps the duplicate with their 
Return.  

▪  Declaration envelopes: Record the polling place, time and number of additional 

declaration vote envelopes allocated in the PPLO Return. 

The transport container must then be re-sealed and the Record of security seals form 
completed and then witnessed by the OIC. 

Use hand sanitiser before and after handling materials. 

Election Procedures Handbook – PPLO/OIC/2IC     Page 10

PPLO Polling place checklist  

The Polling place checklist is a multi-page report 
that must be completed for every visit to every 
polling place. OICs must countersign the report for 
their polling place each time you visit. 

The PPLO should ensure they provide as much 
information as possible to assist the divisional 
office with future planning. It will also assist in 
providing an accurate rating on the performance of 
the OICs at the end of the day. 

Officer-in-charge (OIC) and second-in-charge 
(2IC)

1918) and any instructions from the divisional office.  

Election Procedures Handbook – PPLO/OIC/2IC     Page 11


--- Page 13 ---

OIC Preparation Guide 

The OIC Preparation Guide is a set of documents that will assist you prior to polling day.  

It includes forms that need completing and checklists to follow to assist you in the planning 
and set up of the polling place.  

OIC Return 

The OIC return consists of checklists that will walk you through the activities of polling day and 
forms that you will use to create your polling place records. These records are very important 
for overall reconciliation after polling day and for planning future elections. 

You should refer to the Return frequently and complete as required to ensure you are following 
correct procedures and providing assurance to the AEC of same See page 28 for more 
information on the OIC return. 

COVID-19 vaccination for polling place staff 

As part of COVID-19 safety measures, all staff working at a polling place are required to be fully 
vaccinated against COVID-19 or have a medical exemption. As OIC, you are required to sight 
evidence of vaccination status or medical exemption for staff working at your polling place. 
This should be done at the beginning of the day prior to polling commencing, or for staff that 
commence throughout the day, at the beginning of their shift. 

Proof of COVID-19 vaccination status can include: 

•  Digital or printed COVID-19 vaccine certificate  
• 
•  Some jurisdictional apps used to check in to venues will also display a person’s 

Immunisation history statement 

vaccination status 

Proof of COVID-19 vaccination status is required to be sighted. If someone qualifies for a 
medical exemption, this will be recorded on their COVID-19 vaccine certificate, immunisation 
history statement or evidence issued by the Australian Immunisation register.  

Note that 2ICs and declaration vote issuing officers may have already provided their COVID-19 
proof of vaccination status at their face-to-face training session, however you should sight their 
proof of vaccination as well.     

Contacting your polling place staff 

The OIC return will include a list of the names and contact details of staff (polling officials) 
once recruitment is complete. You should contact all of your staff before polling eve to ensure 
they are prepared for polling day and remind them they will need to provide proof of COVID-19 
vaccination status. 

If any staff inform you that they are unavailable, inform the divisional office immediately so 
that a replacement can be organised. 

Election Procedures Handbook – PPLO/OIC/2IC     Page 12


--- Page 14 ---

Staff management  

You are responsible for briefing, monitoring and directing all of your staff. This includes: 

▪  Allocating duties, ensuring staff know how to perform these duties, and rotating 

staff where applicable. 

▪  Ensuring staff are aware of and complete all relevant forms and records.  
▪  Ensuring staff wear official vests and ID badges. 
▪  Ensuring staff understand ballot paper security requirements, including that ballot 
papers and the certified list must be returned to you in an issuing point storage box 
if an issuing point is left unsupervised. 

▪  Briefing staff before polling and again before scrutiny. 
▪  Organising staff meal breaks, staff should not work more than 5 hours without a 

30 minute break, and 

▪  Monitoring the performance of staff to ensure that procedures are being followed 

correctly, including the COVID-19 safety measures. 

During peak times you may be required to issue votes, direct voters or clear voting screens of 
how-to-vote material left behind by voters to ensure that the polling place is operating 
efficiently. 

Substitute OIC 

If you are required to leave the polling place at any time during voting (such as when you have 
a meal break), the 2IC, or the most senior polling official, must be formally appointed as 
substitute OIC. 

The appointment form is in the OIC 
Return. Prior to the start of polling, you, 
the substitute OIC and a witness sign the 
form. It should then be completed by you 
and the substitute OIC every time a 
substitute OIC is required.  

Election Procedures Handbook – PPLO/OIC/2IC     Page 13


--- Page 15 ---

Second-in-charge (2IC) duties 

In all but small polling places, a 2IC will be appointed to assist the OIC. The OIC may delegate 
responsibility for any function, except those that can be ONLY carried out by the OIC (see key 
responsibilities above).  

It is recommended that the 2IC manage declaration voting at the polling place, but they can be 
asked to perform a range of duties on polling day. 

The 2IC will assist the OIC to set up the polling place on polling day eve. For polling places that 
do not have a 2IC, the OIC should ask another staff member to assist with set up and record 
their additional hours on the attendance record. 

Roles of all other staff 
A number of polling place roles have been adjusted to assist with implementation of physical 
distancing and COVID-19 mitigation requirements: 

▪  Queue controller - you will be allocated at least one queue controller to your polling 

place as they will undertake additional responsibilities related to ensuring adherence 
to COVID-safe measures in the polling place. It will be important to rotate staff 
throughout the day. 

-  Queue controllers - are responsible for managing voter flow, queues and physical 
distancing, and ensuring capacity limits within the polling place are met. They will 
also be encouraging voters to use the hand sanitiser provided, to collect a clean 
pencil at the entry of the polling place, and assist with voter check-in if required. 
-  Hygiene officers – you will be allocated at least one polling official to undertake the 

hygiene officer role, ensuring sanitiser is available and conducting regular 
touchpoint cleaning of issuing areas and voting screens plastic inserts, as well as 
sanitising pencils and pens for reuse. Hygiene officers are required to wear gloves 
at all times while filling this role. 

▪  Ballot box guard - in addition to guarding the ballot box, the ballot box guard will be 

reminding voters to use hand sanitiser as they exit the polling place. 

▪  The OIC and 2IC (if applicable) will be responsible for monitoring and ensuring all 

COVID-19 requirements are implemented in the polling place.  

All polling staff will be required to wear the following identification:  

▪  yellow vest and relevant badge: OIC/2IC, 
▪  purple vest and relevant badge: All other polling staff (ordinary issuing officer, 

declaration issuing officer, ballot box guard, queue controller, hygiene officer, inquiry 
officer, scrutiny assistant). 

No vests or badges are to be shared between staff. Additional badges will be provided for staff 
rotating positions so that they have their own. 

Election Procedures Handbook – PPLO/OIC/2IC     Page 14


--- Page 16 ---

Ordinary issuing officer/ballot box guard/queue controller/hygiene 
officer 

Throughout the day you should rotate these staff between the four roles and ensure that they 
are following correct procedures.  

After the close of poll (i.e. 6pm), these staff will assist with the scrutiny of ordinary votes and 
tidying the polling place. 

Ordinary vote issuing officer  

The primary function of the ordinary vote issuing officer 
is to issue votes to voters who are on the certified list. 
See Issuing ordinary votes on page 47.  This also 
involves: 

▪ 

recording the total number of ballot papers 
allocated by the OIC on the Certified list 
coversheet 

▪  keeping ballot papers and the certified list 

secure  

▪  encouraging voters to update their 

enrolment if required  

▪  completing and signing all required forms and paperwork, especially the certified 

list coversheet 

▪  directing silent electors to the OIC or 2IC to cast a declaration vote, and 
▪  sanitising hands after every ten voters, contact with another person, coughing, 

sneezing or touching their face. 

Ballot box guard 

There MUST be a ballot box guard on duty at all times between 8am and 6pm. 

The primary function of the ballot box guard is to monitor the ballot boxes for ordinary votes. 
This involves: 

▪  stand in close proximity to the ballot box (maintaining appropriate physical 

distancing from voters), 

▪  ensuring ordinary voters place ballot papers in the correct ballot boxes, particularly 
important for dual and multi polling places, and do not leave the polling place with 
ballot papers, 

▪  counting voter flow using the clicker provided, 
▪  ensuring that nobody attempts to retrieve anything from rubbish bins , 
▪  directing voters to use hand sanitiser when exiting the polling place, and 
▪  ensuring ballot boxes are not opened until after 6pm on polling day. 

Election Procedures Handbook – PPLO/OIC/2IC     Page 15


--- Page 17 ---

Queue controller 

Queue controllers are based beside the queuing sign and are responsible for managing the 
queue and flow of voters. This involves: 

▪  organising voters at entry of polling place to ensure capacity limits and physical 

distancing requirements are observed, 

▪  encouraging voters to sanitise their hands on entry, and collect a pencil for 

completing their ballot papers, 

▪  directing voters to mini-queues of one voter in front of each issuing point. Mini-

queues are a very effective way to increase the throughput of voters and decrease 
wait times, 

▪  ensuring that voters from other divisions are directed to the declaration vote 

issuing point, 

▪  ensuring sufficient supplies of sanitised pencils are available for voters at entry, 
▪  every hour, on the hour, recording the total number of voters waiting in the queues 

(including mini queues), 

▪  assisting voters to check in to the polling place using the QR code or manual 

registration system, as required, and 

▪  escorting elderly and frail voters to the head of the queue and identifying other 

voters who require assistance and assisting them, or referring them to the inquiry 
officer, or OIC. 

In larger or busier venues, a second queue controller can be used to assist in the above duties. 

Hygiene Officer 
The primary functions of hygiene officers are: 

▪  spraying and wiping plastic voting screen inserts after every 10th voter (or every 15 

minutes if there is a constant voter flow), 

▪  spraying and wiping the voter side of ordinary issuing tables after every 10th voter 

(or every 15 minutes if there is a constant voter flow), 

▪  spraying and wiping the declaration issuing table after every 10th voter (or every 

15 minutes if there is a constant voter flow), 
removing any material left behind in voting screens between voters, 

▪ 
▪  ensuring there is adequate hand sanitiser at the entrance, exit, and issuing tables 

(shared between staff), 

▪  sanitise pencils used by voters between uses, and return pencils to entry for queue 
controller distribution; and cleaning used pens at the declaration vote issuing 
table, and 

▪  maintaining the polling place in a clean and safe condition. 

Declaration vote issuing officers and inquiry officers 

Throughout the day you should rotate staff between these roles and ensure they are following 
correct procedures.  

These staff also assist with the count of ordinary ballot papers. Inquiry officers can assist with 
the count straight away, but declaration vote issuing officers can only assist after completing 
the checking, balancing, paperwork and packaging of all declaration vote materials. 

Election Procedures Handbook – PPLO/OIC/2IC     Page 16


--- Page 18 ---

Declaration vote issuing officer  

Voters who do not reside in divisions issuing ordinary votes or whose names are not on the 
certified list are directed to declaration vote issuing officers for the issue of absent and 
provisional votes. Only the home division will issue declaration votes in a dual or multi polling 
place see Issuing declaration votes on page 51. 

The declaration vote issuing officer also: 

▪  accounts for all ballot papers allocated and keeps them secure, 
▪  uses the division finder to determine the voter’s enrolled division, 
▪  ensures voters’ ballot papers are placed in the correct declaration envelope which 

is then placed in the correct ballot box, 
▪  guards the declaration envelope ballot box, 
▪ 
▪  sanitises hands after every ten voters, contact with another person, coughing, 

files counterfoils progressively, 

sneezing or touching their face, 

▪  sanitises pens issued to voters after each use or alerting the hygiene officer to 

perform this task, 

▪  completes the Ballot paper tracking form and Elector information reports, 
▪  completes the After 6pm checklist for staff reconciling declaration votes, and 
▪  sorts declaration vote envelopes and counterfoils and reconciles their ballot papers 

after close of poll. 

Inquiry officer  

An inquiry officer moves around the polling area to assist as necessary to: 

▪  attend to the needs of voters waiting in the queue, 
▪  make regular announcements to those in the queue “remember to number every 

box on your green ballot paper and number at least 6 boxes above the line or at 
least 12 boxes below the line on the white ballot paper”, 
▪  answer voter inquiries, including how to cast a formal vote, 
▪  use the division finder to assist voters in determining their enrolled division, 
▪  assist voters who require help in casting a vote, 
▪  assist voters to update their enrolment if required, and  
▪  complete Elector Information Reports. 

Election Procedures Handbook – PPLO/OIC/2IC     Page 17


--- Page 19 ---

Part-day staff 

Part-day staff are employed for shifts of 5 or 8 hours on polling day.  

Discuss starting times with these staff before polling day. They must not work for more hours 
than they have been employed to work. 

They perform the same role as issuing officers and are helpful to rotate in to help cover staff 
breaks and can be asked to perform most tasks except declaration vote issuing and OIC/2IC 
tasks. You will need to provide on the job training for issuing ordinary votes or working during 
the scrutiny. 

Ensure you sight their proof of COVID-19 vaccination status or medical exemption evidence  at 
the commencement of their shift. 

Scrutiny assistant 

Scrutiny assistants are employed on polling night from 5pm until 11pm. Where a scrutiny 
assistant has been assigned the task of returning materials they may continue working after 
11pm.   

Upon arrival at the polling place, scrutiny assistants must report to you and sign an attendance 
record. Ensure you sight their proof of COVID-19 vaccination status or medical exemption 
evidence at the commencement of their shift. 

They may then be asked to: 

remove materials from voting screens, 
▪ 
▪  progressively dismantle cardboard voting 
screens and stack them in a storage area, 
▪  assist with preparation for scrutinies, including 
pre-filling sort cards, labels and setting up 
tables if they do not interfere with the 
operation of the polling place, and 
replace queue controllers and ballot box 
guards while they have a break. 

▪ 

From 6pm, scrutiny assistants may be required to: 

remove signs and posters from the walls, 

▪  assist with the scrutiny of House of Representatives ballot papers and count of 
Senate ballot papers, including unfolding, sorting and counting ballot papers, 
▪  dismantle the remaining cardboard material and prepare cardboard for collection, 
▪  assist with the packaging of material for return to the out-posted centre, 
▪ 
▪ 
▪ 
▪  perform any other official tasks as directed by yourself or the 2IC, and 
▪ 

tidy the polling place, 
inspect the polling place to ensure that no material has been overlooked, 

take custody of material once the polling place is packed up and return it to the 
identified location. 

Election Procedures Handbook – PPLO/OIC/2IC     Page 18

Preparation for polling 

Inspecting the polling place 

Prior to polling day 

Familiarisation with the polling place is an important part of your preparation. 

Contact details for the person who holds the keys at your nominated premises are in your OIC 
return. It is essential that you inspect the polling place as soon as possible. Do not leave this 
task until the last minute. The night before polling day is too late. The DRO will also advise OICs 
if they are working in a dual or multi polling place, if they are the host or guest, and provide 
contact details for co-located OICs. The OIC of the host division is responsible for coordinating 
premises access and set-up with their co-located OICs.  

During the inspection use the OIC preparation guide which contains a summary of the tasks to 
complete when conducting the inspection. If the venue cannot be inspected, contact the 
divisional office. 

On polling day 

Prior to the start of polling the Safety inspection checklist in the OIC return must be completed. 
The OIC can ask any staff member to complete it. 

Polling place equipment 

Receipt of cardboard and other voting equipment 

The divisional office will advise you of the arrangements to supply equipment to the polling 
place. Usually, this equipment will be delivered directly to the polling 
place within the two weeks leading up to polling day.  

You will receive cardboard equipment such as voting screens, ballot 
paper secure zone screens, ballot boxes, issue point storage boxes 
and a bin. 

Depending on the size of the polling place you may also receive 
queuing equipment, issuing point signs, or cardboard tables.  

You should check that your whole allocation – including that for 
dual/multi polling - has been delivered before polling day. If you have been short-supplied or 
the equipment is damaged, advise the divisional office immediately. 

Construction of cardboard equipment 

1.  All instructions for how to construct the cardboard polling equipment are printed on the 

actual equipment, and QR codes linking to video instructions are also provided  

If you have any difficulty constructing any equipment, or have any concerns about the quality of 
the equipment, especially ballot boxes, transport containers or seals contact your divisional 
office for assistance. 

Election Procedures Handbook – PPLO/OIC/2IC     Page 19


--- Page 21 ---

Materials 
The materials for the polling place will be provided at a time and location advised by the 
divisional office. If a dual or multi polling place, each division&#39;s OIC will be supplied with 
relevant materials, however all cardboard materials will be delivered direct to the premises. 

Check that you have received the correct number of items against the election materials 
inventory provided in your OIC return and advise the divisional office of any shortages or if 
anything has been damaged. 

Certified lists 

A ‘certified list’ is the list of people who are eligible to vote in your division. You 
must distribute one to every ordinary vote issuing point before polling commences. 
It contains the name, address, gender and birth date of people enrolled to vote. 
Each ordinary voter’s name is marked off the list when they are given their ballot 
papers. 

After the election the lists are scanned electronically to detect these marks. Polling 
official errors may result in people who voted getting apparent non-voter or multiple 
voter notices so it is important to be as accurate as possible when marking voters 
off the certified list.  

If a spare certified list has been provided it can be used to open an additional temporary 
issuing point during peak periods. The cellophane seal of the spare certified list should not be 
broken unless it is needed. 

Certified list coversheet 

The Certified list coversheet, located inside the front cover of each certified list, is one of the 
critical forms to be completed at the polling place. Every ordinary vote issuing officer who uses 
the certified list must sign it and update the details each time ballot papers are allocated to 
them. 

This form assists with the completion of the OIC return. The Certified list coversheet helps 
accurately balance the number of ballot papers issued to voters with the number of ballot 
papers counted in the scrutinies, and to reconcile the number of ballot papers allocated to the 
polling place. It must stay with the certified list; it is used during the scanning process. 

Any movement of certified lists between polling places must be approved by the DRO and 
noted in the OIC return.  In the rare instance that a certified list has been reallocated from 
another polling place, the reallocation field of the Certified List coversheet must be updated. 

Division finder 

Division finders are an alphabetical listing of all localities and some streets within a state or 
territory and are used to determine a voter’s enrolled division if they are casting a declaration 
vote. 

Before issuing a declaration voter with ballot papers the issuing officer must always consult a 
division finder to determine their correct division and record the division finder reference on 
the declaration vote envelope. 

For instructions on using a division finder, read the division finder guide on page 100. 

Election Procedures Handbook – PPLO/OIC/2IC     Page 20


--- Page 22 ---

Provisional voting statement 

Voters casting a provisional vote must read the provisional voting statement on the back of the 
declaration vote envelope before voting. 

The provisional voting statement explains the reasons for a provisional vote.  

After reading the provisional voting statement, the voter may choose not to vote. If the 
declaration officer alerts the OIC of any such occurrences, this should be recorded on the 
Reports on issues and miscellaneous matters form in the OIC return. 

Issuing point storage box 

Each issuing point will be provided with an issuing point storage box. If an issuing point is 
being closed while an issuing officer is on a scheduled break, ballot papers and, if applicable, 
the certified list must be packed into the storage box and given to the OIC for storage in the 
secure zone. 

How to vote guide 

The How to vote guide has information in a range of languages (including 
English) to assist voters to cast a formal vote. 

The guide must be made available to any voter who has trouble 
understanding how to fill in their ballot papers.  

Polling places with a queue controller and/or inquiry officer should issue 
these roles with a How to vote guide for use when assisting voters.  

Your polling place may be given extra copies of individual pages if it is in an 
area known to have a high number of voters who may benefit from the 
information. These pages should be easily accessible to voters within the polling place. 

ID badge 

All polling officials must wear a role appropriate identification badge so that other polling 
officials, scrutineers and members of the public can easily identify each official’s role. 

Badges should be changed when polling officials rotate into different roles. Lanyards and 
badges must not be shared for hygiene reasons. 

AEC vest 

Every polling official in your polling place must wear an AEC vest - yellow 
vests for the OIC and 2IC and purple vests for the remaining polling staff. 

Vests remain the property of the AEC at all times and must be removed 
during breaks and returned at the completion of polling night. Vests must not 
be shared for hygiene reasons. 

Packaging tape 

Packaging tape is used on bags that do not have an adhesive seal, where 
the adhesive seal cannot be used (for instance the bag may be folded in a 
way that prevents the use of the seal) or if the adhesive seal isn’t strong 
enough to hold the bag closed. Tamper evident tape is then placed over the 
packaging tape. 

Election Procedures Handbook – PPLO/OIC/2IC     Page 21


--- Page 23 ---

Tamper evident tape 

Tamper evident tape is used on parcels of ballot papers and some packages for transfer. The 
tape is perforated and tears at equal lengths without the need for scissors. 

Tamper evident tape should not be used to seal parcels or packages. It should be stuck over 
the final seal of the parcel or package to show it hasn’t been tampered with. If someone 
attempts to remove this tape from a parcel it will leave an obvious residue as evidence of 
tampering.  

Note: Tamper evident tape will also leave a residue on walls, windows and carpet etc., which is 
very difficult to remove, so it should ONLY be used for parcelling and packaging purposes.  

Reserve stock of polling materials 

To avoid running out of ballot papers or other material on polling day, you must check 
remaining supplies at regular intervals. Contact your PPLO if you suspect you will be short of 
any item. 

If additional election forms, declaration vote envelopes or ballot papers are required but 
cannot be obtained from the PPLO or out-posted centre quickly enough to supply current 
demand, forms may be photocopied or amended in order to continue providing voting services. 
See the troubleshooting section on page 94 for more information. 

Additional materials 

In addition to normal materials, polling places will receive: 

▪

Hygiene requirements 

The following provisions will be in place for polling staff: 

▪  QR codes for check in and manual sign-in sheets if unable to use QR code, 
▪ 
▪  hand sanitiser to be used: 

capacity limits indoors, and physical distancing, 

   when entering (or re-entering) the polling place 
   by issuing officers every ten voters 

immediately after coming into physical contact with a voter or other staff 
member 
immediately after touching face, or 

   at any other time contamination could have occurred. 

▪  masks will be available if staff want to wear them, 
▪  masks should be replaced as soon as they become damp and should not be re-

used, 

▪  gloves will be required for hygiene officers, and available for other staff that want 

to wear them (for example if staff are concerned about the effect of sanitiser on 
their hands). If worn, hand sanitiser must still be applied to the outside of the 
gloves to the same regularity, and 

▪  staff should wash their hands before, during and after breaks. 

The following provisions will be in place for voters: 

▪  QR codes for check-in and manual sign-in sheets if unable to use QR code, 
▪  capacity limits indoors, and physical distancing 
▪  hand sanitiser to be used on entry and exit (and as requested) 
▪ 
▪  voters are welcome to wear their own masks and gloves but based on health 

regular touchpoint cleaning, and 

advice, these will not be issued by the AEC. 

The COVID-19 safety measures signs are to be placed around the polling place to remind 
everyone of the requirements.

Ballot paper handling 

Ballot paper principles 

The AEC upholds the sanctity of the ballot paper in all its forms and at all times.   

As an AEC official, you have a responsibility to uphold the integrity of all ballot papers at all 
times in accordance with the following ballot paper principles:  

1.  All ballot papers remain ‘live’ from printing through to statutorily authorised 

destruction. 

2.  The security, integrity and accountability of ballot papers must be preserved at all 

times - including transit and storage by the AEC, contractors, or other third parties.  

These two maxims of ballot paper handling must never be breached and must underpin AEC 
operations, culture and standards.  

Collecting ballot papers  

Ballot papers for each polling place will be packaged and sealed inside ballot paper transport 
containers with a Record of ballot paper transport container seals form.  

If you are collecting polling material directly from the AEC you will be required to show 
identification at the time of collection: 

▪  Drivers licence, 
▪  Passport, or  
▪  Your Confirmation of Casual Employment form AND a Medicare or credit card. 

Where ballot papers are being sent via courier you will be informed of the estimated time of 
delivery. Once materials arrive you must sign the consignment form and send an email to the 
divisional office to confirm the receipt of polling materials.  

Note that each OIC in a dual or multi polling place will receive their own allocation of ballot 
papers and other materials from their respective divisional offices. Advise the divisional office 
if polling material does not arrive within the expected timeframe. 

Issuing ballot papers 

The process for issuing ballot papers to electors are outlined below and on the placecards 
provided for each ordinary and declaration vote issuing officer. It is extremely important that 
issuing officers follow the script, and give electors the correct advice about completing ballot 
papers. If an elector asks a question relating to casting their vote or how their votes are 
counted and the issuing officer is unsure of the answer, the elector should be referred to the 
OIC or the AEC website.   

Ballot paper check count and reconciliation 

When you receive ballot papers you must check count your ballot paper stock following these 
steps: 

▪  Unseal the transport container in the presence of a witness. Please advise the 
divisional office if you do not have anybody to act as witness so alternate 
arrangements can be made. 

Election Procedures Handbook – PPLO/OIC/2IC     Page 25


--- Page 27 ---

▪  Check count the individual Senate ballot papers to ensure that the correct number has 

been received. 

▪  Check count the House of Representatives ballot papers, noting that if they are 

supplied shrink-wrapped or padded with numbered butts, it can be assumed that each 
pack/pad contains the number of ballot papers advised on the packing slip, so only the 
number of bundles need to be check counted. 

▪  Write the total number of ballot papers received on the House of Representatives and 

Senate worksheets in the OIC return, and 

▪  Seal the transport container and complete a Record of ballot paper transport container 

seals in the presence of a witness. 

▪  Wash your hands or use hand sanitiser before and after. 

Do not wait until polling day to count the ballot papers. Let the divisional office know 
immediately if the number of ballot papers does not match the ballot paper inventory.  

Ballot papers that are stored in the OIC’s home/accommodation overnight (prior to polling) 
must be kept in a secure zone. This must be a secure area in your home that is out of public 
view and unlikely to be accessed by others.  

Ballot paper secure zone  

During the polling place set-up the OIC must establish a secure zone. The secure zone is a 
designated area for the storage of ballot papers – it must be visible to the OIC but not readily 
accessible to the public. Ballot papers for each division in a dual or multi can be stored in the 
same secure zone but segregation should be maintained at all times.  

Cardboard screens will be provided to each polling place which must be used to cordon off the 
designated area.   

A lockable internal room may be used as an alternative secure zone provided the room 
remains locked and the only keys are in possession of the OIC. 

Unallocated ballot papers must be kept in the transport container inside the secure zone. The 
transport containers must remain closed but do not need to be sealed during polling.  

The OIC, PPLO or permanent AEC staff are authorised to access to the secure zone. No other 
staff should enter unless authorised to do so by the OIC. 

Ballot boxes 

Ballot boxes are cardboard or moulded plastic (polypropylene) containers. Although they are 
sealed, they are not a secure container, and should not be left unattended in public view at 
any time. 

Travelling with ballot papers 

Ensure that ballot papers and completed declaration envelopes are transported inside sealed 
containers, out of sight in a fully enclosed, locked vehicle. 

Leaving ballot papers or certified lists in a vehicle overnight is strictly prohibited.

OIC records 

Introduction 

The records of your polling place are consolidated in two documents; 

1.  the OIC preparation guide, for the period before polling day and  
2.  the OIC return, for polling day. 

It is essential that you complete these documents accurately in order to account properly for 
ballot papers, the conduct of polling and the scrutiny. 

OIC Preparation guide 

The OIC preparation guide has been designed to provide you with information to prepare for 
polling day. 

It is broken into two sections: 

1.  Section A: checklists 

Outlines the tasks to be completed prior to polling day, such as the completion of 
training, inspecting the polling place and contacting staff.  It also guides the OIC when 
setting up the polling place on the day before polling. 

2.  Section B: preparation forms 

Section B contains the forms that are required prior to polling day to ensure you are 
fully equipped, and to assist with setup of your polling place and managing polling 
staff. 

Inventories 

Section B of the OIC preparation guide will contain a materials inventory list and a ballot paper 
inventory list. 

These inventories are used to ensure the OIC has received all materials and ballot papers for 
the polling place. 

It is important that the inventory checks are conducted as soon as possible and that the OIC 
contacts the divisional office immediately if any items are missing or have been damaged. 

When check counting ballot papers the OIC must follow the steps listed in Section A to ensure 
ballot papers are handled according to AEC policy. The number of ballot papers received by the 
OIC is recorded in the OIC return on the House of Representative and Senate worksheets. 

Memorandum to OIC 

This provides key details about your polling place – the details of the premises, the estimated 
numbers of votes, and staffing numbers 

Staffing forms 

Two forms provided include names and contact information for the staff allocated to your 
polling place, and a form for recording their emergency contact details prior to election day. 

Election Procedures Handbook – PPLO/OIC/2IC     Page 27


--- Page 29 ---

Polling place layout 

Section B may also contain the polling place layout diagram which will instruct the OIC on how 
to set up the polling place. 

The divisional office may have designed the polling place to allow for things such as privacy for 
voters when marking their ballot papers, a clear view of voting screens for issuing officers, a 
separate declaration vote issuing area and smooth voter flow from entrance to exit. 

You should follow this plan as closely as possible. Discuss any modifications with the PPLO. 

Hub and/or ROM locations 

These forms provide details concerning where your materials should be delivered on polling 
completion. 

The OIC Return  

The OIC return is used on polling day and is a complete record of how the polling place 
functioned throughout polling and the scrutiny. 

The return has four sections:  

▪  Section A: checklists of all the tasks to be completed on polling day and night, 
▪  Section B: mandatory forms to be completed throughout polling day and night, 
▪  Section C: circumstantial forms that are only completed in certain circumstances, such 

as if a ballot box is opened prematurely, and 
▪  Section D: staffing and work health safety forms. 

When the OIC return is complete, sign the title page before packing the return for transport. 

The OIC return is the appropriate place to document any accidents, complaints by voters or 
scrutineers, and any other incidents in your polling place. 

You must complete the return throughout the day as events take place. It is important that you 
provide as much detail as possible; this assists in investigating any matters as required after 
polling day. 

If you have any difficulties completing the return, contact your PPLO. 

Section A of the OIC Return 

Section A of the OIC return guides you through the tasks required of you as an OIC during and 
after polling. It also refers you to forms in other sections when required.  

Section A is laid out according to the polling day timeline and starts prior to polling on polling 
day. Ensure you refer to Section A of the OIC return regularly so that your polling place is being 
managed according to AEC policy and procedure during and after polling. 

The OIC should delegate tasks where possible, however it is still the OIC’s responsibility to 
ensure all tasks are carried out as required. 

The PPLO will be checking the OIC return to ensure it is being completed correctly and the 
divisional office will also review the return after polling day. 

Election Procedures Handbook – PPLO/OIC/2IC     Page 28


--- Page 30 ---

Section B of the OIC Return 

Section B consists of the forms and records that the OIC is required to complete throughout 
the polling period. 

When you receive your OIC return you should inspect Section B and ensure the forms listed on 
the table of contents have been included in your return, if any are missing inform your 
divisional office. Your divisional office may also include more forms if required. 

Some forms will be allocated to issuing points or ballot boxes etc. and you will have multiple 
copies of these. 

Substitute OIC 

This form must be used each time the OIC leaves the polling place for a break. It should be 
pre-signed by the OIC, 2IC (or next most senior polling official) and a witness before polling 
starts and updated each time the OIC leaves the polling place.  

House of Representatives and Senate worksheets  

The House of Representatives and Senate worksheets are used before, during and after 
polling to reconcile the ballot papers allocated to your polling place. At the end of polling it is 
important to be able to account for all ballot papers. The two forms are used the same way, so 
we will use the House of Representatives worksheet as an example here. An explanation of 
each section is on the next page. 

Election Procedures Handbook – PPLO/OIC/2IC     Page 29


--- Page 31 ---

Election Procedures Handbook – PPLO/OIC/2IC     Page 30


--- Page 32 ---

Polling place ballot papers section: 

As soon as you receive your ballot paper allocation and OIC return count the ballot papers and 
record the number received in the top section of the House of Representatives and Senate 
worksheets. If the DRO or PPLO allocates more ballot papers to your polling place, or takes any 
from your polling place, you must also record those figures on the top section. This gives you 
the total number of ballot papers you must account for after polling. 

In the worked example 2400 House of Representatives ballot papers were initially allocated, 
and at some stage the PPLO transferred 100 ballot papers from this polling place to give to a 
neighbouring polling place. 

Issuing point ballot papers section: 

During polling: the left side of this section is used every time you allocate ballot papers to an 
issuing point. In this worked example there are 4 ordinary issuing points (identified by the 
certified list number). The ordinary issuing officer should have also recorded these allocations 
on the certified list coversheets. There are two declaration vote issuing points (identified by 
issuing point number) and they should have recorded the same figures on the Ballot paper 
tracking forms. 

After polling: the right side of the worksheet is used to reconcile the ballot papers. Looking at 
the first ordinary issuing officer row we can see that issuing point 1001 was allocated 400 
ballot papers over the day, had to replace 6 spoilt ballot papers and had 73 unused. This 
means 321 votes were issued by this issuing point. The subtotal for ordinary vote issuing 
points tells us how many ballot papers have been issued and it should balance with the 
number counted during the scrutiny plus any discarded ballot papers. 

Election Procedures Handbook – PPLO/OIC/2IC     Page 31


--- Page 33 ---

Final reconciliation section: 

This section can be fully completed once the scrutiny has been conducted. Complete the 
calculations on the form and ideally the difference field will be zero, meaning you have 
accounted for every ballot paper. If the balance is not zero you should double check 
calculations, quickly search the polling place for missing ballot papers and if required do one 
(only) quick recount of ballot papers, however there are a few reasons why you may not 
account for all ballot papers, as described on page 72. 

There is a pre-filled example of this form in the OIC return that explains which sections are 
filled in during polling and which are filled in after polling. 

Election Procedures Handbook – PPLO/OIC/2IC     Page 32


--- Page 34 ---

OIC result of count – House of Representatives and Senate 

These forms are used to record the results for the House of Representatives first preference 
scrutiny and the Senate count. Once recorded the figures are phoned through to the divisional 
office. 

Two candidate preferred forms  

The TCP forms are supplied in a sealed envelope. They consist of the Direction to count further 
preferences form, which provides instructions for the OIC on the two candidates, and the OIC 
two-candidate preferred worksheet which is used to record the results of the TCP and then 
phone the figures through to the divisional office. 

You are not to open the envelope until after 6pm. 

OIC Identification 

The OIC Identification is a unique code that you need to read out to the divisional office each 
time you phone through scrutiny results. 

The OIC Identification will be provided to you in the sealed envelope with the TCP forms and 
should be kept secure at all times. 

Ballot paper tracking form 

A copy of this form is to be given to each declaration vote issuing point.  

Each time you allocate ballot papers to the issuing point, you record it on the House of 
Representatives and Senate worksheets, and the declaration vote issuing officer must record 
it on this form, with House of Representative ballot papers tracked at division level. 

At close of poll the total number of spoilt ballot papers, unused ballot papers and declaration 
envelopes issued must be totalled for each division.  

Once complete, this worksheet is given to you and you must amalgamate the figures from each 
Ballot paper tracking form on the Summary of declaration votes issued form.  

These worksheets must be placed in the OIC return on completion. 

Summary of declaration votes issued  

Using the Ballot paper tracking forms that have been completed by your declaration vote 
issuing officers, record the number of declaration votes issued at every declaration vote 
issuing point for each division.   

The totals should balance with the House of Representatives and Senate worksheets. 

Record of postal vote certificates  

If any postal votes are handed in to the polling place, including any cancelled postal votes, 
record details on this page. 

Record of voters in queue 

This page is completed each hour and records the number of voters that have passed through 
(as recorded by ballot box guard clicker) and number of voters in the queue.  

Election Procedures Handbook – PPLO/OIC/2IC     Page 33


--- Page 35 ---

Section C of the OIC Return 

Section C of the OIC return contains forms that you only need to fill in if the circumstance calls 
for it, such as if a ballot box opened prematurely. 

Issues and miscellaneous matters  

This form is to be completed if there are any issues, complaints, disturbances or unusual 
matters during polling or during the scrutiny. It should also be used for any additional notes for 
the divisional office, for example about the suitability of the polling place for electors or staff. 

Report polling issues such as excessive queues or if tamper evident tape on parcelled ballot 
papers/packaged material has been broken while still in the polling place.  

You should also record on this form any incidents that prevent a staff member from taking a 
required meal break e.g., they refuse to take a break even after the requirement is explained 
to them. 

Prematurely opened ballot box report 

The Prematurely opened ballot box report is to be completed if a ballot box is opened 
prematurely – that is before 6pm. 

You must include as much detail as possible including the circumstances of the ballot box 
being opened and details of all witnesses. 

This form is to be given to the DRO as soon as possible after the ballot box is opened, along 
with the ballot box and all ballot papers/declaration vote envelopes that have been removed 
from the ballot box (if any). See Troubleshooting on page 96 for more information on 
prematurely opened ballot boxes. 

Section D of the OIC Return 

Section D contains forms required for staffing and workplace health and safety, such as 
attendance records and the meal break roster. 

Incident notification form  

If there are any health and safety incidents or hazards identified during the day, record the 
details on the Incident Notification form. Please note the following broad definitions: 

▪  hazard – the potential to cause harm to people, property or environment, 
▪  near hit – incident that did not result in harm to a person, property or the 

environment, and 
incident - harm to people, property or environment. 

▪ 

You must provide comprehensive details about the incident. 

Attendance record 

This record is to assist the divisional office in processing payments. You must ensure all staff 
sign this form on arrival.  

Election Procedures Handbook – PPLO/OIC/2IC     Page 34


--- Page 36 ---

OIC and Staff assessment 

The OIC uses this form when assessing polling staff performance of their duties. Ratings are to 
be recorded against each staff member using the rating scale on the report. Ensure you read 
the rating scale carefully in order to accurately apply the correct rating to each staff member. 
Include comments for all staff. 

Meal break roster  

The meal break roster allows you to plan your staff breaks ahead of time by blocking out the 
half hour break for each staff member. 

Polling place set-up 
One of your duties is to prepare the polling place on polling eve.  

The OIC preparation guide provides instructions of the tasks to 
be completed when setting up the polling place.  

Do not erect external signs until polling day. 

The polling place will need to be set up to encourage 1.5m 
distancing where possible. The following measures will assist in 
implementing the physical distancing and sanitisation 
requirements: 

▪ 

▪ 

▪ 
▪ 

▪ 

Mark the floor with cloth tape (do not use tamper evident tape for this), to identify 
where voters should stand. Cut 20cm length strips of tape to create crosses on the 
ground: 
o  at issuing points, 
o 
o 

in mini queues of one, 1.5m from the first mark (if space permits), 
in the main queue outside the polling place. It is suggested that at least 6 
marks 1.5m apart be put on the floor so that there is clear distancing for voters 
arriving at the polling place. Depending on the venue, it may be more effective 
to use long strips of tape to mark lines rather than crosses for the external 
queue 

A table at the entry of the polling place for hand sanitiser. Please ensure this is in a 
prominent spot.  
A table at the exit of the polling place for hand sanitiser.  

Each issuing point must have easy access to hand sanitiser (within reach while 
seated). Hand sanitiser on issuing desks should not be placed near the ballot 
papers. 
Voting screens set up: 
o  1.5m distanced standalone against a wall, 
o  Two screens back-to-back 1.5m distanced, or 
o  Screen bank established with issuing officers to manage distancing (least 

preferred) 

Note: If the floor is wooden, vote screens may move during the day. The OIC must ensure that 
voting screens are re-positioned as needed. Tape can be used to assist with fastening to 
floor, if required.  

Election Procedures Handbook – PPLO/OIC/2IC     Page 35


--- Page 37 ---

▪  Every voter screen should have a plastic insert. 
▪  A separate table for declaration voters to complete their envelope, in front of the 

declaration vote issuing table.  

▪  COVID-19 safety measures posters placed outside near the queue, and at locations 

inside the polling place. 

▪  Venue capacity poster at the entrance to the polling place. 
▪  QR code signs for checking in to the polling place at intervals along the path of 
travel to the entrance to the polling place. This encourages people to check in 
before reaching the entry of the polling place and avoiding a bottleneck.   

Use the sanitising spray to wipe down tables and voting screens and other equipment as 
necessary, once you have set up the polling place on polling eve. The hygiene officer should 
always spray onto the paper towel rather than directly onto election equipment. Used personal 
protective equipment (PPE) should be disposed of in a dedicated PPE bin that is double lined. 

Polling place access 

Where parking is limited, polling staff, scrutineers and party workers should be asked to park 
further away from the polling place during polling hours. 

At polling places that do not have permanent disabled parking spaces, and where safe to do 
so, the disabled parking signs should be placed in a car park close to the entrance of the 
polling place first thing in the morning on polling day.  

Rubbish bins 

The AEC provides cardboard bins in polling places.  

AEC bins should be placed at the exit of the polling area so that voters 
must walk past the ballot boxes before they reach the bin and where the 
ballot box guard is able to view the bins.  

Used PPE should be disposed of in a separately marked bin, with two bin 
liners. Your polling place has been provided with: 

▪  a second cardboard bin, 

▪  two bin liners for this bin, and 

▪  a sign indicating this bin is for used PPE only  

When disposing of used PPE: 

▪  remove mask (or gloves), 

▪  place in labelled cardboard bin, 

▪  when bin is full seal both bin liners, and 

▪  dispose of as part of general waste. 

Used sanitising wipes can be disposed of with general waste.

Layout 

The OIC preparation guide may contain a plan for the layout of the polling place. You should 
follow this plan as closely as possible. Discuss any modifications with your PPLO. 

The layout of the polling place should allow: 

▪  orderly access (if the polling place has two doors, use one as the entry and the 

other as the exit) with a single direction of movement throughout the polling place 
so that voters flow through easily with minimal cross over, 

▪  physically distanced bank-style queuing of voters (a single queue at one point, 

away from the issuing points but well within the polling place when possible) and 
mini queues at each issuing point (where space permits). To ensure the continuous 
flow of voters, mini queues of one voter should then be maintained in front of each 
issuing officer so there is minimal delay while the voter walks to the issuing point, 
▪  a clear view of the voting screens for issuing staff, so they can control voter flow, 
▪  privacy for voters while they mark their ballot papers, 
▪  constant supervision of the ballot boxes, 
▪  space to set up an additional issuing point if lengthy delays occur during peak 

periods, 

▪  a separate declaration voting area with its own ballot box and voter flow that does 

not interrupt the ordinary issuing voter flow, 

▪  a separate voter flow for any guest divisions issuing votes in a dual/multi polling 

place, and clearly sign-posted ballot boxes for each division, 

▪  hand sanitising stations and pencil collection/drop-off at the entry and exit of the 

polling place, 

▪  bins placed at the exit of the polling premises, past the ballot boxes, for general 

waste and used PPE, 
the OIC table located with a view of all areas of the polling place, and 

▪ 
▪  ballot paper secure zone that is visible to the OIC but not accessible to the public 

and maintains segregation of ballot papers for host and guest divisions. 

The layout of voting screens has been remodelled to reflect COVID-19 safety measures. OICs 
should aim to set up a minimum of one voting screen per 100 voters, using the vote estimates 
provided in the Memorandum to OIC in your OIC static preparation guide. You will have been 
supplied with extra screens which can be assembled if there is room to do so.  

The configuration used will depend on the size and layout of the polling place. At all times, the 
most important consideration is to ensure physical distancing between voters. Following are 
suggested configurations in order of preference: 

Election Procedures Handbook – PPLO/OIC/2IC     Page 37


--- Page 39 ---

1.  Against a wall  

Voting screens are set up against a wall with 
1.5m separating each screen. 

The wall provides stability for each screen and 
provides a clear 1.5m separation. 

This layout provides ease of management for 
issuing officers.  

2.  Back to back 

Two screens back-to-back, secured at the top 
with a fold back clip (fold back clips used to 
secure Senate ballot papers can be used for 
this purpose). 

The fold back clips assist to provide stability to 
voting screens.  

3.  Bank of screens 

This layout should be used if the polling place 
does not have a suitable wall to place screens 
against. 

If using this layout issuing officers should direct 
voters to the most appropriate vote screens to 
manage physical distancing between voters.  

This layout requires greater staff management 
of voters.  

Extra supplies of other cardboard (issuing point boxes, ballot boxes, queuing equipment) 
should be used on an as needed basis. Due to COVID-safe measures pencils with string should 
NOT be attached to voting screens as voters are instead encouraged to collect a clean pencil 
at the entrance to the polling place. 

The examples shown below incorporate these principles. Consider them when setting up your 
polling place if the divisional office has not provided a plan. 

Election Procedures Handbook – PPLO/OIC/2IC     Page 38


--- Page 40 ---

Election Procedures Handbook – PPLO/OIC/2IC     Page 39


--- Page 41 ---

Polling day 

Prior to 8am 
The OIC return provides guidance for polling day before 8am to ensure the polling place and 
staff are ready for polling to commence at 8am. 

OIC arrival 

Both the OIC and the 2IC must arrive at the polling place no later than 7am. 

You must bring your Confirmation of casual employment form, all polling materials, a fully 
charged mobile phone (and charger) and all the keys required to open the polling place.  

Staff arrival 

Polling staff should arrive and be ready to start work by 7am so they can be briefed and assist 
with the preparation for the start of polling. It is critical that all staff arrive on time. 

If any staff member has not arrived by 7:50am, contact the PPLO.  

On arrival, you must sight their Confirmation of casual employment form, proof of COVID-19 
vaccination status and issue them with their identification badge and the appropriate vest. If a 
staff member does not produce their confirmation form, confirm their employment using the 
latest staffing list provided. Collect any forms provided to you by staff and store them in 
Section D of the OIC return. All polling place staff will be allocated a vest and ID badge 
corresponding to their role when on duty. These must be removed on breaks, and returned at 
the end of their shift.  

Staff must sign the attendance record before commencing duties. 

Allocation of duties 

As outlined in Roles of all other staff on page 14, polling officials will have been allocated to 
one of two groups: 

▪  ordinary issuing officer, ballot box guard, queue controller, hygiene officer and part 

day staff 

▪  declaration vote issuing officer or inquiry officer. 

Staff can be rotated between various functions, but only within their group, as they have not 
been trained to perform the duties of another group.  

Only in emergency situations (such as non-attendance), should you move staff between 
groups. In such cases, consult your PPLO. You must then provide on-the-job instruction for the 
polling official.  

In addition to the materials allocated to ordinary and declaration issuing points during set-up, 
the following are required: 

Ballot box guard materials 

Ballot box guards require a clicker (counter) to count ordinary voters as they place their ballot 
papers in the ballot boxes. 

Election Procedures Handbook – PPLO/OIC/2IC     Page 40


--- Page 42 ---

Queue controller materials 

Queue controllers require a queuing record and a pen.     

Inquiry officer materials 
Inquiry officers require a division finder and a How to Vote Guide. 

Hygiene officer materials 

Hygiene officers require gloves, sanitising spray and paper towels. 

Distribution of ballot papers and certified lists 

Ballot papers must be distributed to ordinary issuing and declaration issuing points before 
polling commences. Once the transport container has been unsealed to distribute ballot 
papers it must remain closed within the secure zone, but does not need to be sealed during 
polling. Certified lists are allocated to each ordinary issuing point. 

Materials at ordinary and declaration vote issuing 
points should be set out close by so that repetitive 
reaching or twisting is minimised. Staff should take 
into account whether they are left or right handed 
when working out where to place ballot papers on 
their table so that they can easily initial them and 
hand over when issuing to voters.   

Note: If an issuing officer is on a scheduled break or 
an issuing point is being closed, ballot papers and, if 
applicable, the certified list must be packed into the 
storage box and given to the OIC for storage in the 
secure zone. 

Ordinary issuing point  

OICs must allocate no more than half of their total ballot paper allocation to ordinary vote 
issuing officers at the start of the day. 

Additional ballot papers are to be allocated as required throughout the day.  

These steps should be followed every time ballot papers are provided to issuing officers: 

▪  Count the individual ballot papers and record the total number of ballot papers 

provided to each issuing point on the House of Representatives – Worksheet and 
Senate – Worksheet in the OIC return, and 

▪  The issuing officer should count and record the number of ballot papers received 

on the certified list coversheet. If there is a discrepancy, it should be checked and, 
if necessary, adjusted using your reserve. 

The issuing officers are to retain the stubs from fully used booklets and return them to you with 
their unused ballot papers after the close of polling. 

Election Procedures Handbook – PPLO/OIC/2IC     Page 41


--- Page 43 ---

Declaration vote issuing points 

Declaration vote issuing points receive the following ballot papers before polling begins: 

▪  a supply of House of Representatives ballot papers for the division in which the 

polling place is situated (for provisional voters), 

▪  absent packs - packs of fully printed House of Representatives ballot papers for all 
other divisions within the state/territory. These should be stored in the declaration 
ballot paper holder and divided, by division, using the ballot paper dividers,  
‘open’ House of Representatives ballot papers (for use as a last resort only). These 
are blank ballot papers that can be turned into a ballot paper for any division by 
copying the exact details of the candidates for a division as shown in the list of 
candidates booklet, and 

▪ 

▪  Senate ballot papers. 

These steps should be followed every time ballot papers are provided to declaration issuing 
officers: 

▪  count all the ballot papers allocated, including those provided as declaration 

packs, and record the total number of papers provided to each issuing point on the 
House of Representatives and Senate Worksheets in the OIC return, 
the issuing officer must count and record the number of each ballot paper received 
on the Ballot paper tracking form. 

▪ 

Prepare outside of polling place 

Polling place boundary 

The divisional office will advise you if the building 
or the entire grounds will be designated as a 
polling place. 

If the entire grounds are to be considered as the 
polling place, the electoral offences sign must be 
displayed at each entrance to the grounds. 

If only the building is considered the polling place, 
the electoral offences sign must be displayed at 
each entrance to the part of the building in which 
polling is conducted. 

Party workers must remain at least six metres away from the boundary. 

The sign should be placed so that it is easy to see and read when voters enter the polling 
place. 

EXAMPLE: If a school building is used as a polling place and notices are displayed at each 
entrance to the grounds, the entire school grounds are part of the polling place. The school 
boundary fence becomes the perimeter of the polling place. If this is the case party workers 
must remain at least six metres outside the school grounds. 

Election Procedures Handbook – PPLO/OIC/2IC     Page 42


--- Page 44 ---

Ask your staff to: 

▪  make sure that all designated entrances and exits, including doors and gates are 

unlocked, 

▪  erect all the necessary outside signs, for example ‘polling place’ banner and 

‘electoral offences’ poster, and 
rectify any hazardous areas that may lead to accidents. 

▪ 

Briefing staff and scrutineers 

Staff 

Staff must be briefed on their duties and responsibilities before the polling place opens at 
8am. This is especially important for staff working in the ordinary issuing officers/ballot box 
guards/queue controller roles as they have not received training. 

The OIC return instructs you on the timing of the brief and the script you should follow when 
briefing your staff.  

Taking time to brief staff before polling can prevent mistakes during the day and allow time for 
staff to familiarise themselves with the materials they will be using during the day. 

Ensure staff are ready to commence polling duties at 8am sharp. 

Ensure staff know that they cannot access the secure zone unless explicitly authorised by the 
OIC. Otherwise, only the OIC, PPLO, or permanent AEC staff can access the secure zone. 

Ensure staff know that ballot papers and certified lists must be supervised at all times and, if 
leaving the issuing point, must be returned to the OIC in the issuing point storage box for 
secure storage in the secure zone. 

Scrutineers 

If there are any scrutineers appointed to observe polling use the OIC return to assist with their 
briefing.  

All scrutineers must wear a designated scrutineer identification badge attached to a lanyard 
whilst in the polling place. 

There is more information on scrutineers in the ‘Candidates, Party Workers and Scrutineers’ 
section on page 87. 

Sealing of the ballot box 

It’s important that the ballot boxes are sealed and ready for use before the first voter is ready 
to place their ballot papers in the ballot boxes. If it is a dual or multi polling place, separate 
ballot boxes must be set-up for each division, and clearly marked and managed accordingly. 

For each ordinary ballot box: 

Ordinary ballot boxes are made of cardboard 

▪  Show the empty ballot box to any scrutineers or staff present. 
▪  Close and seal the ballot box by threading numbered plastic security seals through 

the holes at each end. 

Election Procedures Handbook – PPLO/OIC/2IC     Page 43


--- Page 45 ---

▪  Record details of the security seal numbers on the Record of ballot boxes and 

Security Seals and file in the OIC return. 

▪  Have a witness (scrutineer or polling official) sign your entry.  
▪  Wash your hands or use hand sanitiser before and after, and 
▪  Repeat this process during the day if additional ballot boxes are required. 

A sealed ordinary ballot box must NOT be opened until after 6pm on polling day. If a ballot box 
is opened prior to 6pm there are strict procedures that must be followed by the OIC. See 
Troubleshooting on page 96 for more information. 

For each declaration ballot box: 

Declaration ballot boxes are made of plastic and have a lid that is sealed to the container, with 
a slot that is open during polling for the ballot papers, in declaration envelopes, to be inserted. 

▪  Show the empty ballot box to any scrutineers or staff present. 
▪  Close and seal the ballot box by threading numbered plastic security seals through 

two opposing sides of the lid. 

▪  Record details of the security seal numbers on a Record of security seals form. 
▪  Have a witness (scrutineer, party worker or polling official) sign the entry, and 
▪  Place the Record of security seals form in the plastic window on the ballot box, this 

form must always stay with this ballot box and 

▪  Wash your hands or use hand sanitiser before and after. 

Note that declaration ballot boxes must NOT be opened until after 6pm on polling day. If a 
ballot box is opened prior to 6pm there are strict procedures that must be followed by the OIC. 
See Troubleshooting on page 96 for more information. 

During polling 

Open the polling place 

8am 

Just before 8am check the time so that the polling place opens at exactly 8am. 
Visiting https://time.is/ will give an accurate time. 

At precisely 8am, the OIC opens the polling place and admits anyone waiting to 
vote. The OIC then signs the declaration in the OIC return to declare that the polling 
place was opened at the correct time. 

Monitoring  

Staff and procedures 

As soon as possible after 8am and again at regular intervals, you should move around the 
polling place, listening to the questioning method used by staff, ensuring they are explaining 
how to correctly fill in each ballot paper, watching what they are doing, and checking forms and 
other paperwork. Also check that the specific COVID-19 procedures are being followed, such as 
physical distancing, sanitising after every 10th voter, and voters and staff using hand sanitiser. 

Election Procedures Handbook – PPLO/OIC/2IC     Page 44


--- Page 46 ---

If there are problems, speak to the relevant staff member and explain the correct procedure. 
Check periodically that the problems do not recur. If they do, it may be necessary to move that 
person to a different position.  

Section A in the OIC return will prompt you to monitor staff several times over the day. Of high 
importance is:  

following COVID-19 safety measures, 

▪ 
▪  marking certified lists correctly, 
▪  completing the certified list coversheet (ordinary issuing points) and ballot paper 
tracking form (declaration issuing point) as soon as ballot papers are allocated 

▪  queues being managed correctly including the use of mini-queues, 
▪  asking the 3 questions (ordinary issuing officers), 
▪ 

following the declaration vote issuing procedure (declaration vote issuing officers), 
and 

▪  directing silent electors to the OIC or 2IC. 

If there is a 2IC they should be responsible for monitoring the issue of declaration votes. 

The polling place should be maintained in a neat and tidy and fully serviceable condition at all 
times (pencils sharpened, posters correctly displayed, voting screens cleared of litter, etc.).  

Staff ratings 

As an OIC, you are required to assess staff in the performance of their duties and assign them 
a rating. These ratings are important for future election staffing and need to be carefully 
considered. You must ensure that you observe staff throughout the day to assist in completing 
the assessment.  

After polling, ratings are to be recorded on the OIC and staff report that is included in the OIC 
return. 

Please provide a comment beside staff that should be considered for promotion to the next 
level, and if possible indicate staff who should be considered first for promotion.  

Ballot paper security  

All polling staff must take every precaution with allocated ballot papers in their care and never 
leave ballot papers unattended. The OIC must never leave the reserve stock of ballot papers in 
public view.  The reserve stock must be stored in the transport container within the secure 
zone. 

If issuing officers have to leave their issuing point or an issuing point is closed at any time, 
ballot papers and certified lists must be removed from issuing points, put into issuing point 
storage boxes and given to the OIC for safekeeping in the secure zone.  

Ballot boxes that are full must remain with the ballot box guard or, if that restricts voter flow, in 
the secure zone. 

Election Procedures Handbook – PPLO/OIC/2IC     Page 45


--- Page 47 ---

Staff breaks 

If you close an issuing point to allow staff to have a break, leave the same issuing point closed 
for all breaks and rotate staff through the open issuing point(s) where applicable. 

Issuing points must be sanitised when there is a changeover of staff. The declaration moulded 
ballot box should also be wiped over with changeover of staff. Spray onto the paper towel, not 
onto the ballot box. 

Queue control and voter flow 

The queue controller(s) and, where employed, inquiry officer should 
work together to control the flow of voters through the polling place. 
Issuing officers can assist by not issuing ballot papers to voters until a 
voting screen is available. 

▪  Generally the start of the queue will be at the entrance to 

the polling place, to promoted adherence to capacity limits. 
A queue controller will be at the head of the queue 
managing voter flow into and within the polling place, and 
monitoring the external queue to ensure voters are 
maintaining 1.5m distance. 

▪  The queue controller will be directing voters to available 

issuing points. If issuing points are busy, the voters will be 
directed to a mini queue of one person behind each issuing 
point, if space permits. 

▪  The queue controller will be responsible for ensuring the maximum number of 

people allowed inside the polling place at one time is not exceeded. Larger polling 
places will be allocated a second queue controller for this purpose, to ensure a 
strict one–out, one-in policy is followed if the polling place is at capacity. The 
second person will be monitoring the exit, the overall number of voters in the 
polling place, and communicating with the queue controller at the entrance 
regarding any issues with numbers or voter flow. 
It is important that the queue controller/s are monitoring the overall voter flow in 
the polling place so that queueing inside the polling place is minimised. 

▪ 

▪  Sometimes voters arrive in family groups. These voters will be expected to queue 

separately once inside the polling place and should not be encouraged to approach 
an issuing point together, unless a voter requires assistance. Children can stay 
with an adult but will count towards the total number of people inside the polling 
place. 

▪  Voters requiring help may request assistance and can be sent to the front of the 
queue. This may include voters with a disability or those who are elderly or 
pregnant. 

▪  Queue controllers direct voters to collect pencils at entrance. 

Queue controllers can also assist with manual registration of voters for COVID-
tracing purposes if necessary. 

Election Procedures Handbook – PPLO/OIC/2IC     Page 46


--- Page 48 ---

Issuing ordinary votes 
The ordinary issuing process includes the following safety measures: 

▪  ordinary issuing officer to sanitise hands every 10 voters, 
▪ 

the hygiene officer will be required to sanitise the issuing area every 10 voters 
or every 15 minutes, and 

▪  ordinary issuing officers are to assist in keeping track and alert the hygiene 

officer when required. The issuing officer table should be sanitised whenever 
there is a changeover of staff. 

Issuing votes to ordinary voters involves 3 steps: 

1.  Asking the voter the three questions, 
2.  Marking their name off the certified list, and 
3.  Handing the initialled ballot papers to the voter with instructions on how to complete 

each ballot correctly. 

Step 1 - Ask the voter the three questions 

Ordinary vote issuing officers must ask voters the following three questions prior to marking 
their name off the certified list: 

Question 1 ‘What is your full name? 

If the voter’s name is found on the certified list, ask the voter question two.  

If the voter’s name cannot be found on the certified list, confirm the correct spelling or ask if 
they may be enrolled under a different surname. If the voter still cannot be found, the voter 
should be directed to the declaration vote issuing point. 

See the Troubleshooting section of this manual for more information on finding a voter’s name 
on the certified list. 

Question 2 ‘Where do you live?’ 

Note: Included in the certified list are names for which address details are not shown. These 
are silent, itinerant or designated electors who must be directed to the OIC or 2IC to be issued 
with a declaration vote. These entries must not be marked on the certified list. See electors 
with address suppressed on page 54 for more information. 

If the address given is the same as the one on the certified list, ask the voter question three. 

If it is a previous address for the voter, they should be asked to update their enrolment online. 
Then ask them question three as an ordinary vote can still be issued. 

If the address is a place where the voter has never lived, the entry is probably for a different 
person. Direct the voter to the declaration vote issuing point. 

Question 3 ‘Have you voted before in this election?’ 

If the voter answers ‘No’, they are issued with an ordinary vote. 

If the answer is ‘No’, but the name is already marked as having voted on the certified list, 
direct the voter to the declaration vote issuing point. 

Election Procedures Handbook – PPLO/OIC/2IC     Page 47


--- Page 49 ---

If the answer is ‘Yes’, you must first be sure that the 
question is understood. Rephrase the question; for example, 
‘When and where did you vote in this election?’ If the answer 
is still ‘Yes’ the voter cannot vote again; you must advise 
them that the law allows a voter to vote only once in an 
election. 

Questions over voter identity 

If there is any question as to the identity of a voter they 
should be referred to the OIC. If, after making enquiries, you 
cannot find the person on the certified list, the usual 
procedure is to issue the person with a declaration vote. 

See the Troubleshooting section of this manual for more information on voter identity. 

Step 2 - Mark the certified list 

The voter’s name must be marked off the certified list by the ordinary issuing officer before 
ballot papers are issued. The OIC must ensure the issuing officer is marking the certified list 
correctly as follows: 

Mark the certified list only with the special black pen provided. Using the certified list ruler, 
draw one continuous line between the arrowheads to the left of the voter’s name.  

Do not draw through the number or the name. If this happens make sure to also draw between 
the arrow heads. 

See the Troubleshooting section of this manual for procedures to correct a mistake when 
marking the certified list. 

Step 3 – Issue ballot papers 

Before ballot papers are issued, the issuing officer must initial the circle on the front of each 
ballot paper given to the voter.  

The issuing officer should use their real initials and ballot papers are not to be pre-initialled.  

Wait until there is a vacant voting screen. This is important to control voter flow.  

Election Procedures Handbook – PPLO/OIC/2IC     Page 48


--- Page 50 ---

Tell the voter the following: 

“For the House of Representatives, complete the ballot paper by placing a number one 
in the box next to the candidate who is your first choice, and then number every box in 
the order of your choice.  

For the Senate, complete the ballot paper by numbering at least six boxes above the 
line OR by numbering at least twelve boxes below the line, 
in order of your choice. You can continue numbering as 
many additional boxes as you choose.  

If you make a mistake, bring the ballot paper back to me 
and I will give you another one.” 

Note: there will be a placecard at each issuing point that includes 
the above script, so issuing officers don’t have to memorise this. 

Before being directed to an empty voting screen, the voter should 
be informed that assistance is available if required and that they 
must fold their ballot papers and put them in the correct ballot 
boxes after voting. Also advise the voter to ensure they take 
everything with them out of the polling place, and to dispose of 
pencils in the receptacle provided at exit. 

See page 58 for information on assisting voters who need help 
completing their ballot papers. 

The golden rules for issuing ordinary votes 

Ensure that you ask the three questions. 

Initial both ballot papers before handing them to the voter, do not pre-initial ballot papers. 

Take care to mark the correct voter off the certified list between the arrow heads. 

Ensure the security of ballot papers and certified lists by returning them to the OIC if your 
issuing point will be left unsupervised. 

Assist with voter flow by only handing the ballot papers to the voter when there is a vacant 
voting screen.  

Declaration votes 
The following describes how to issue a declaration vote. This will be done by a declaration vote 
issuing officer/inquiry officer or 2IC/OIC only. 

The declaration issuing process includes the following safety measures: 

▪  declaration vote issuing officer to sanitise hands after every 10 votes, 
▪  declaration voter should collect a clean pen to complete declaration envelope and 
ballot paper (unless they brought their own). When returned the declaration vote 
issuing officer should ensure the voter deposits the pen in the used pens 
container. The declaration vote issuing officer should ensure there is a stock of 
clean pens and may need to advise the hygiene officer to sanitise used pens,  

Election Procedures Handbook – PPLO/OIC/2IC     Page 49


--- Page 51 ---

▪  where possible, an additional table will be placed in front of the declaration issuing 
desk so that the voter completes their declaration envelope at a separate table to 
the issuing officer, 
the hygiene officer will be required to wipe down the declaration issuing area after 
every 10 votes or 15 minutes. 

▪ 

Introduction  

Declaration votes are issued to voters who cannot cast an ordinary vote on polling day. See 
‘Absent vote’ and ‘Provisional vote’ below for more information. 

Before they are given ballot papers, declaration voters must record their details on a 
declaration vote envelope. The front of the declaration envelope can be seen in detail on page 
117.  

The declaration vote envelope has a counterfoil (non-carbon copy paper) inside it that is 
removed after the envelope has been completed.  

Once the declaration voter has voted, their completed ballot papers are inserted into the 
declaration vote envelope which is sealed and inserted into the ballot box and will later be 
forwarded to the division in which the voter is claiming to be enrolled. 

Types of declaration votes  

Absent vote 

An absent vote is issued to voters from the 
same state/territory but a different division to 
the polling place.  

Provisional vote 

A provisional vote is issued when the voter 
claims to be enrolled for the issuing division, 
but: 

▪ 
▪ 
▪ 
▪ 

their name cannot be found on the certified list, 
their name on the certified list is already marked as having voted, 
their name, but not their address, is on the certified list (a silent elector), or 
their identity cannot be confirmed for an ordinary vote. 

If a voter could not be found on the certified list, they can be advised they can check their 
enrolment online at aec.gov.au. They should be offered a declaration vote if there is any doubt 
or they believe they are enrolled in the division. 

Interstate vote 

A voter who is enrolled in a division in a state or territory other than the state or territory you 
are in will require an interstate vote. 

Your polling place cannot issue votes for other states/territories. This voter must be referred to 
a polling place that can issue interstate votes. A list of these locations will be supplied by the 
divisional office. 

Election Procedures Handbook – PPLO/OIC/2IC     Page 50


--- Page 52 ---

Secrecy of the vote 

Voters may ask how their vote can be kept secret if their ballot papers are enclosed in a 
declaration vote envelope that shows their name.  

Advise them that strict procedures are followed for the removal of ballot papers from 
declaration envelopes to prevent any name being linked with any ballot paper and that those 
procedures may be witnessed by scrutineers. 

Issuing declaration votes 

Step 1 – Provide the voter with a pen if required. The voter completes sections 1 to 3 on the 
declaration vote envelope.   

Ask the voter to print legibly and firmly. 

The issuing officer may assist a voter who has difficulty writing or understanding 
the process. See page 58 for more information on assisting voters.  

The issuing officer checks the declaration vote envelope, ensuring that all 
relevant details have been completed legibly with: 

full name, 

▪ 
▪  permanent address where the voter normally lives (except silent 

electors), 
former name (if applicable), 

▪ 
▪  voter’s address on the electoral roll, if different from the permanent address. This 

is the address that you must check in the division finder, and 

▪  evidence of identity. Note: this is not compulsory; if the voter cannot provide 

evidence of identity, continue to issue the vote. 

Step 2 - Use the division finder.  

Using the voter’s address on the electoral roll, the issuing officer determines the voter’s 
correct division in the division finder. 

A division finder reference must be recorded on every declaration vote envelope, except in the 
case of silent electors. For example, the reference is written as 016028 (Page 16, Entry 28).  

Write the enrolled division on the envelope.  

For instructions on using a division finder, read the division finder guide on page 100. 

Step 3 - Determine the type of declaration vote to be issued. 

If the voter is claiming enrolment for an address in another division within the same state or 
territory, they are to be issued an absent vote. Ask the voter to sign section 4 of the declaration 
vote envelope then go to step 5. 

Election Procedures Handbook – PPLO/OIC/2IC     Page 51


--- Page 53 ---

If the voter is claiming enrolment at an address in the division of the polling place, they require 
a provisional vote. The issuing officer ensures that the certified list has been checked before 
proceeding to issue a provisional vote and then goes to step 4. 

Step 4 – The provisional voting statement. 

The voter must read the provisional voting statement on the back of the declaration envelope. 

The issuing officer may read the statement to the voter if they request assistance. 

Ask the voter to sign section 4 of the declaration vote envelope. 

Step 5 - Complete the polling official sections.  

The issuing officer ensures that the polling place name is recorded in the Issued at box and 
signs AND dates as issuing officer in the ‘Witnessed by issuing officer’ box. 

The issuing officer ticks the pre-issue check boxes down the right hand side of the envelope 
(pictured) to confirm that the division finder reference has been completed and the voter has 
signed the declaration vote envelope.   

Note: a declaration vote envelope that is completed in error and is not required should be 
discarded. It is not included in the 6pm reconciliation. 

Step 6 - Select and initial the correct ballot papers.  

The issuing officer must select a House of Representatives ballot paper that matches the 
division written on the declaration vote envelope and a Senate ballot paper. 

The issuing officer initials the front of each ballot paper within the circle provided.  

The issuing officer must use their correct initials and does not pre-initial ballot papers.  

Step 7 - Issue the ballot paper and instructions. 

The issuing officer waits until there is a vacant voting screen to hand over the ballot papers. 
This is important to control voter flow. 

Note: The declaration vote envelope must remain with 
the issuing officer, it is not given to the voter. 

The issuing officer tells the voter: 

“For the House of Representatives, complete the 
ballot paper by placing a number one in the box 
next to the candidate who is your first choice, 
and then number every box in the order of your 
choice.  

For the Senate, complete the ballot paper by numbering at least six boxes above the 
line OR by numbering at least twelve boxes below the line, in order of your choice. You 
can continue numbering as many additional boxes as you choose.  

If you make a mistake, bring the ballot paper back to me and I will give you another 
one.”

--- Page 54 ---

Note: issuing officers will be provided with a placecard for their issuing point that includes the 
above script, so will not have to memorise this. 

The voter should be informed that assistance is available if required and that they must fold 
their ballot papers and return them to the same issuing point to be placed in their declaration 
vote envelope. 

The voter can use the pen they have been provided with to complete their ballot papers. 
Remind the voter not to leave anything behind in the voting screen. 

Step 8 - While the voter is completing their ballot papers, the issuing officer checks the 
declaration envelope. 

A.  Has the voter signed the declaration section? Has the issuing officer signed and dated 

as witness? 

B.  Did the issuing officer use the enrolled address to determine the correct division? 
C.  Did the issuing officer issue ballot papers for the correct division? 

Step 9 - File the counterfoil.  

Remove the counterfoil from the envelope. Check that it can be read. If anything on the 
counterfoil cannot be clearly read, write over the information based on the declaration vote 
envelope. Do not attempt to copy over the voter’s signature. 

File it in the declaration records counterfoil binder in alphabetical order, first by division and 
then by family name and given names. 

Step 10 - When the voter returns with ballot papers:  

▪ 

▪ 

▪ 

the issuing officer asks the voter to repeat their name to ensure that their ballot 
papers are placed in the correct declaration vote 
envelope 
the issuing officer inserts BOTH ballot papers into the 
envelope, seals it and places the envelope in the 
declaration vote ballot box 
the voter should be requested to return their pen for 
sanitising and further use 

▪  use hand sanitiser at least every 10 voters, alert the 
hygiene officer to regularly wipe down the table and 
chair the voters use. 

The golden rules for declaration vote issuing 

Always use the division finder to determine the correct division. 

Always use the address shown in the Address on Electoral Roll field. Do not use the permanent 
address unless the voter has confirmed that it is also the enrolled address. 

Ensure that the division on the ballot paper matches the division on the declaration vote 
envelope. 

Ensure that the declaration vote envelope is signed by the voter and witnessed and dated by 
the declaration vote issuing officer. 

Ensure that both ballot papers are folded and placed in the declaration envelope. 

Election Procedures Handbook – PPLO/OIC/2IC     Page 53

Electors with address supressed 

Silent electors 

Silent electors are those electors whose address details do not appear on the certified list. The 
privacy of a silent elector is to be observed at all times.   

Silent electors are directed to the OIC or 2IC for the issue of a declaration vote. For these 
electors, follow the declaration vote issuing process except: 

▪  do not complete the address sections of the declaration vote envelope. Write 

‘SILENT’ in the address sections before giving the declaration vote envelope to the 
elector. If the elector enters their address or telephone number, it must be 
completely covered with black pen on both the envelope AND the counterfoil so it 
cannot be read, and 

▪  ask the elector to identify their division using the division finder – you must explain 
the use of the division finder to the silent elector and once they tell you the division 
you record it on the declaration vote envelope. The division finder reference is not 
recorded on the declaration vote envelope. 

Silent electors must not have their name marked off the certified list. 

Other electors with address supressed 

Other voters with their address supressed may be itinerant voters (voters who have no fixed 
address) or designated electors.  

Depending on their situation itinerant electors are enrolled at the address for which they were 
last eligible to enrol for, at the address of their next of kin, or the division they were born in or 
are most closely connected to. An itinerant elector’s enrolled address will not be shown on the 
certified list.  An elector whose address is not shown on the certified list must  be referred to 
the OIC or 2IC who issues them a declaration vote in the same way as a silent elector, except if 
the elector knows their enrolled address, they can complete the address fields on the 
envelope. Some voters may only be able to provide a division. In this case the division finder 
reference field is left blank.  

Electors with their address suppressed must not have their name marked off the certified list. 

Election Procedures Handbook – PPLO/OIC/2IC     Page 54


--- Page 56 ---

Spoilt or discarded ballot papers 
Note: When processing spoilt or discarded ballot papers, you must use a separate ‘spoilt or 
discarded ballot paper envelope’ for each ballot paper. 

Spoilt ballot papers 

If a voter makes a mistake on a ballot paper they can return it to an issuing 
officer who should:   

▪  cancel the spoilt ballot paper by writing ‘SPOILT’ on the back 
▪ 

in full view of the voter, place the spoilt ballot paper in a spoilt or 
discarded ballot paper envelope 

▪  seal the envelope 
▪  complete the fields on the envelope: 

- 

tick the type of ballot paper spoilt (House of Representatives or 
Senate), record the division or state/territory as appropriate and 
seal the envelope 
tick the type of voter (ordinary or declaration) 
tick the ‘Spoilt’ box on the envelope 

- 
- 
-  sign as issuing officer 
issue a new ballot paper, remembering to initial it. 

▪ 

If a voter loses a ballot paper they cannot receive a second one. 

Keep spoilt ballot paper envelopes at the issuing point with unused ballot papers, to be 
counted and reconciled after polling. 

Discarded ballot papers 

During the day, polling officials or voters may find ballot papers that have been dropped in the 
polling place or left in a voting screen.  

These must be given to you, they must NOT be put in the ballot box.  They are not included on 
the certified list coversheet reconciliation or as part of the declaration vote reconciliation. 

As the OIC you will: 

▪  write ‘DISCARDED’ on the back of the ballot paper 
▪  place it in a spoilt or discarded ballot paper envelope 
▪ 
▪ 
▪ 

tick the type of voter if known 
tick the ‘Discarded’ box on the envelope 
tick the type of ballot paper discarded (House of Representatives or Senate) and 
record the division or state, as appropriate, and 
▪  seal the spoilt or discarded ballot paper envelope. 

You will count and record discarded ballot paper envelopes after polling. 

Election Procedures Handbook – PPLO/OIC/2IC     Page 55


--- Page 57 ---

Postal votes 
Some voters who have applied for a postal vote may wish to:   

lodge their postal vote 

▪ 
▪  cancel the postal vote and vote in person, or 
▪  advise that they did not receive their postal vote and wish to vote in person. 

Voters in these circumstances should be directed to the OIC. 

Receiving a completed postal vote 

If a voter wants to lodge their postal vote at your polling place, you should take the completed 
postal vote and: 

▪  on the front of the postal vote return envelope (under the return address), write the 
words ‘Received by me at [name] polling place’, sign it, and include your position 
title, the time and the date of receipt 
record the details on the ‘completed postal votes’ section of the Record of Postal 
Vote Certificates form in the OIC return  

▪ 

▪  place the sealed postal vote envelope in the declaration vote ballot box,. 

Cancelling a postal vote 

If a voter has been issued with a postal vote but would like to have an ordinary vote at your 
polling place, the postal vote can be cancelled. 

You should take the postal voting material and: 

▪  write ‘CANCELLED’ in large, clear letters on the postal vote return envelope 
▪  place the postal ballot papers and the postal vote certificate in the envelope and 

▪ 

seal it 
record the details in the ‘cancelled postal votes’ section of the Record of Postal 
Vote Certificates form in the OIC return, and 

▪  place the cancelled postal vote in the declaration vote ballot box. 

The voter can then cast an ordinary or declaration vote as appropriate. 

Postal vote not received 

People should be directed to cast an ordinary or declaration vote as appropriate where they 
advise they have: 

▪  applied for a postal vote but did not receive it 
▪ 
▪ 

received and misplaced postal ballot papers, or 
received postal ballot papers and filled them out but are unsure if they have 
returned them to the AEC. 

Details of such cases must be recorded on the ‘postal votes not received by voters’ section of 
the Record of postal vote certificates form in the OIC return. 

Election Procedures Handbook – PPLO/OIC/2IC     Page 56

Recording voter information  

Electoral enrolment  

A voter’s enrolment must be updated if their details have changed from those on the certified 
list in cases where: 

▪ 
▪ 
▪ 

their address has changed 
their name has changed, or 
their name has been omitted. 

If the voter is directed to complete a declaration vote envelope do not ask them to complete an 
enrolment form – the envelope will be used to update their details. 

For remaining voters, they should be encouraged to update their details online by scanning the 
QR code provided or visiting aec.gov.au.  

Where neither of the above options are available, the OIC has a small supply of paper 
enrolment forms and reply paid envelopes. Encourage the voter to fill in their enrolment form 
on the spot. 

▪ 

It must be legible. 

▪  They cannot use a postal address for their residential address. 

▪  The voter provides evidence of identity (EOI). They can provide a driver’s licence 

number, passport number or have an enrolled voter confirm their identity and sign 
the form. 

▪  The voter must sign and date the form. 

▪  Some states/territories will require a witness to sign the form as well. The form will 

make this obvious.  

Make sure any completed enrolment forms are filed in the completed enrolment forms 
envelope. 

If the voter is unable to complete the form on the spot, ask them to complete it and post it to 
the divisional office or update their details via the AEC website. 

Elector information report 

The elector information report form should be completed when: 

▪ 
▪ 
▪ 
▪ 

there are errors in the voter’s enrolment details on the certified list 
the voter’s name is spelt incorrectly 

there are inaccurate address details (such as a wrong house number) 
the voter’s name is on the certified list twice, or 

Election Procedures Handbook – PPLO/OIC/2IC     Page 57


--- Page 59 ---

▪  advice is received about the inability of other people to vote, such as because of 

illness, death or other circumstances. 

A ballot paper must never be issued to allow a person to vote on 
behalf of another person.  

Avoid commenting on whether people may be fined for not voting, 
as this will be determined after the election. 

Note: the elector information report is not used to change a voter’s 
address. The electoral enrolment form or declaration vote envelope 
is used for this purpose. 

Assisted voting 
A voter who seeks assistance to complete a ballot paper should be directed to the OIC, 2IC, or 
inquiry officer. Issuing officers should not leave their issuing point unattended to assist. 

You should assist a voter if you are satisfied that they require help to vote. Any voter may seek 
help, but the following groups have been identified as those most likely to require assistance: 

the elderly 

▪ 
▪  people with a physical injury or disability that makes it difficult for them to 

complete a ballot paper 

▪  people who are blind or have a vision impairment 
▪  people who are deaf or have a hearing impairment 
▪  people with low literacy 
▪  people from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds. 

You should attempt to identify voters requiring assistance as soon as possible. Use common 
sense to advise electors that there is help available to them should they need assistance. 

Assistance to voters  

The voter can nominate any person (except a candidate) to help them. That person could be a 
friend or relative, a scrutineer, a party worker or a polling official. If the voter declines to 
nominate someone, you should provide assistance or delegate a polling official to assist the 
voter. 

Assistance by a person nominated by voter 

Where a person nominated by the voter provides assistance: 

▪ 
▪ 

the voter and the nominated assistant enter an unoccupied voting screen, and 
the nominated assistant helps the voter to complete their vote, which may include 
completing, folding and depositing the ballot paper in the ballot box.  

In this situation, scrutineers are not allowed to enter the voting screen while the ballot paper is 
being completed (unless the scrutineer has been nominated as the assistant). 

Election Procedures Handbook – PPLO/OIC/2IC     Page 58


--- Page 60 ---

Assistance by a polling official 

Where you or a delegated polling official is assisting a voter, the following rules apply: 

▪  one scrutineer from each candidate is entitled to listen to the instructions given by 

▪ 

the voter and to observe how the ballot paper is completed 
the voter may provide written instructions on how they want to complete the ballot 
paper (for example, a how-to-vote card). Confirm that the voter is aware of the 
contents of the written instructions 

▪  a witness must be present when the polling official completes the ballot paper. A 

scrutineer or, if there is no scrutineer, another polling official or a person 
nominated by the voter may be a witness, and 

▪  an interpreter is entitled to be present at all times if the voter needs such help. 

Take care not to suggest particular answers or to ask leading questions. 

Assistance must be provided to voters if requested. While in this instance it may not be 
possible to maintain a strict 1.5m distance, ensure there is no physical contact, use 
appropriate personal protective equipment such as a face mask, and sanitise hands 
immediately afterwards. 

Assistance to complete a declaration vote envelope  

Where assistance is being provided to a declaration voter the above instructions apply for 
voting, but only the delegated polling official should complete the declaration vote envelope. 
They must: 

▪  complete the required details on the declaration vote envelope 
▪ 

if required, read the details and the provisional voting statement to the voter and 
have them confirm that the information is correct 
if the voter has a hearing impairment, give them the declaration envelope and 
show them the provisional voting statement (if required) to read and confirm the 
information 

▪ 

▪  have the voter sign the declaration. If they are not able to sign, follow the 

instructions in ‘voters unable to sign’ below 

▪  sign and date in the space provided at ‘witnessed by issuing officer’, and 
▪  obtain the signature of a witness and their title (for example, ‘scrutineer’, ‘polling 

official’ or ‘voter’) on a blank area of the envelope. 

Assisting voters who are unable to sign 

If a voter is unable to sign, they may make their ‘mark’ as a signature. The polling official must 
add the words ‘his mark,’ or ‘her mark,’ or ‘their mark’ above the voter’s mark and print the 
voter’s given name(s) to the left of the mark, and the voter’s family name to the right of the 
mark. 

Election Procedures Handbook – PPLO/OIC/2IC     Page 59


--- Page 61 ---

The issuing officer must then sign and date as the witness. 

A person who holds power of attorney for a voter is NOT permitted to sign the declaration vote 
envelope on behalf of that voter.  

Assisting voters outside the polling place 

A voter may vote outside (but within close proximity to) the polling place if you are satisfied that 
the voter is unable to enter the polling place because of any condition that prevents them from 
entering the polling place, such as: 

▪  physical disability 
▪ 
▪  advanced pregnancy. 

illness, or 

If the voter can vote without assistance they are entitled to the same privacy as inside the 
polling place. If a voter requires assistance the same ‘rules’ apply to assistance inside the 
polling place. 

The ballot papers are handed to the polling official who then returns to the polling place and 
places them in the ballot box.  

Discrimination and communication 

People living with disability 

The Disability Discrimination Act 1992 (the Discrimination Act), which came into effect on 
1 March 1993, makes it unlawful to discriminate on the basis of disability. This Act recognises 
that people with disability have the same fundamental rights as other people and should have 
equal opportunities to participate in community life. 

People with disability are no different from any other Australians and have the right to be 
treated in the same way that you would wish to be treated. 

▪  According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, almost one in five Australians 

reported as living with disability at the 2016 census. That is 18.3 per cent of the 
population, about 4.3 million people. Disability can be: physical – affecting a 
person’s mobility or dexterity. 
Intellectual – affecting a person’s ability to learn. 
▪ 
▪  Psychological – affecting a person’s thinking process. 
▪  Sensory – affecting a person’s ability to hear or see. 
▪  Neurological – affecting the person’s brain and central nervous system, or 
▪ 

Immunological – the presence of organisms causing disease in the body. 

Election Procedures Handbook – PPLO/OIC/2IC     Page 60


--- Page 62 ---

When providing electoral services to someone living with disability, always: 

treat adults as adults 
treat the person as you would any other 

▪ 
▪ 
▪  address the person by their first name only when extending the same familiarity to 

all others 

▪  speak directly and clearly to the person with disability, including when they are 

accompanied by a person without disability 

▪  offer assistance if it appears necessary, but don’t assume they will accept it 
▪  ask, if you are unsure about the best way to communicate with the person 
▪  speak clearly, without raising your voice, to assist voters who are deaf or have a 

hearing impairment 

▪  have writing paper and pens ready. 

Remember that people living with disability should not be treated differently. People may 
appreciate understanding, but be intolerant of sympathy or people being condescending. 

▪  Do not tell an individual that you admire their courage or determination. 
▪  Never stare at or avoid looking at a physical disability. 
▪  Do not express sympathy for the individual or presume that they are more fragile or 

sensitive than others. 

▪  Do not assume that someone with a speech or hearing impediment is intellectually 

impaired. 

▪  Never feel uncomfortable using the word ‘see’ when addressing a blind person, or 

‘hear’ when addressing a hearing impaired person. 

▪  Never raise your voice or yell at someone who is having difficulty hearing you. 
▪  Above all, as in any new situation, use common sense, be respectful and 
considerate, offer assistance and do not hesitate to ask questions. 

People from a culturally and linguistically diverse background 

When providing electoral services to voters from culturally and linguistically diverse 
backgrounds, it is important to have patience, understanding and a supportive attitude. 

Show consideration for all voters: 

▪  be aware that cultural differences exist; for example, in some situations it is 

considered more appropriate for women to be served by women 

▪  some voters may mistrust and/or be suspicious of government processes 
▪  some voters may be nervous about their English proficiency. 

If a voter shows confusion or concern in being directed to a declaration issuing point, take time 
to carefully explain the process to them. 

Be aware of multilingual staff employed at the polling place and the languages they speak, so 
that you can refer voters from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds to them if 
necessary.  OICs should ask the staff at the morning briefing if anyone is fluent in another 
language and happy to support multilingual voters who may speak the same language. 

Where voters indicate a need for assistance in completing forms or papers provided, polling 
staff should offer to assist accordingly.  

Election Procedures Handbook – PPLO/OIC/2IC     Page 61


--- Page 63 ---

Where multilingual staff are not available, the following points may assist with communication 
in English: 

▪  speak slower than normal and as clearly as possible 
▪  do not raise your voice 
▪  do not be patronising 
▪  ask whether there is someone with the voter who can help 
▪  simplify your language by using smaller words or phrases such as ‘Where do you 

live?’ 
if necessary, use hand gestures or simple drawings to support what you are saying 

▪ 

▪  ask the voter to write down their name to help you to find it on the certified list (if 

applicable) 

▪  ask the voter whether they have some form of identification with their name and 

address on it (if applicable), and 

▪  use the How to vote guide. 

Preparing for the close of polling 
The OIC return includes a list of tasks that should be completed to prepare for closing the 
polling place.  

Depending on the size of the polling place and how busy you are, during the latter part of the 
afternoon you may arrange to dismantle some voting screens and close down some issuing 
points. The dismantled voting screens should be stacked ready for collection. At least one 
ordinary and one declaration point must remain open until the close of polling. 

Make sure that you and your staff take the opportunity to vote before 6pm. 

Scrutiny assistants 

Scrutiny assistants should arrive by 5pm. As they arrive, brief them on their duties (which 
include dismantling voting screens, tidying the premises and preparing materials for post 6pm 
activities) and ensure that they sign the attendance record and their proof of COVID-19 
vaccination status is sighted.  Scrutiny assistants can also be used to replace queue 
controllers and ballot box guards while they have a break.   

After 6pm they will also be required to assist with the scrutiny and count of ballot papers and 
other duties as directed by you. One scrutiny assistant per polling place will also be identified 
by the DRO to return materials on behalf of the OIC once the polling place is packed up. 

Election Procedures Handbook – PPLO/OIC/2IC     Page 62


--- Page 64 ---

Close of polls 

Just before 6pm, check the time so that your polling place closes at exactly 6pm. Visiting 
https://time.is/ will provide the accurate time. 

Have a second person (preferably a scrutineer) witness the time check and confirm the time of 
closure of the polling place by signing the Polling place declaration in the OIC return. When the 
doors of the polling place are closed at 6pm sharp, any person still in the polling place has a 
right to vote. If there is a queue and it is not possible for all voters to be in the polling place, a 
polling official should join the end of the queue at 6pm sharp and no other person should be 
allowed to join the queue or vote. 

Election Procedures Handbook – PPLO/OIC/2IC     Page 63


--- Page 65 ---

After polling 

Preparation for scrutiny 
Section A of the OIC return provides a guide to the 
tasks to complete once all voters have left the polling 
place and the doors are locked.  

Ordinary issuing staff must complete their ballot paper 
reconciliation before helping with the scrutiny.  

Declaration vote issuing staff must complete their 
ballot paper reconciliation and declaration vote 
envelope reconciliation before helping with the 
scrutiny of ordinary votes. 

If the premises has more than one division operating at it, each OIC will run a separate scrutiny 
of ordinary votes with their allocated staff (unless otherwise instructed,).  
Ballot papers from the different divisions must be kept separate at all times.  

The first preference and two candidate preferred (TCP) counts will need to be set up and 
conducted so that 1.5m distancing is maintained as much as possible.   

The following measures are to be in place during the scrutiny: 

▪  where possible, staff to work on individual tables and remain 1.5m apart 
▪  where possible, staff can be seated 
▪  use the sanitising spray to wipe the tables before and after the scrutiny 
▪  use the sanitising spray to wipe the ballot box (including the seals) before opening 

after 6pm. Always spray onto the towel rather than the election material 

▪  hand sanitiser to be readily available 
▪  staff to sanitise their hands at the start and end of the count, and regularly during 

▪ 

the count including when ballot papers are moved between tables, and 
if 1.5m physical distancing cannot be maintained, masks should be worn, including 
by scrutineers. 

Before 6pm 

To assist in the preparation of the scrutiny, during the afternoon of polling make sure that staff 
have been assigned specific tasks for the scrutiny and they understand how to carry out these 
tasks. Sort cards and packaging labels can also be prepared before 6pm. 

Staff and scrutineers 

Briefing 

You are in control of the scrutiny and must therefore explain the order of tasks to be carried 
out to polling officials and scrutineers before beginning the scrutinies. The OIC return assists in 
delivering the briefing. 

Page 64    Election Procedures Handbook – PPLO/OIC/2IC


--- Page 66 ---

Scrutineers during the count 

Entitlement 

For guidelines on eligibility and appointment of scrutineers please see ‘Candidates, party 
workers and scrutineers on page 87.  

As OIC, you will be the point of contact for scrutineers during the count. You must check 
appointment forms when scrutineers arrive and issue identification badges. You will need to 
exercise discretion to ensure that reasonable requests by scrutineers are met, while not 
unduly delaying election results from your polling place. 

In a polling place with more than one division operating, scrutineers are only entitled to 
monitor activities for the division for which they were appointed.  

Rights and responsibilities 

All proceedings at the scrutiny are open to inspection by scrutineers and they can inspect any 
ballot paper without touching it. 

Scrutineers may enter and leave the polling place at any time during the scrutiny provided they 
have shown you a completed appointment form. 

Scrutineers must not: 

remain in a polling place without a scrutineer’s badge 
touch ballot papers 

▪ 
▪ 
▪  help with clearing voting screens or the removal of material from the polling place, 

or 

▪  unreasonably delay or interfere in the progress of the scrutiny of votes. 

When a scrutineer leaves the polling place, they must return their badge. 

Objections to ballot papers 

If a scrutineer objects to the formality of a House of Representatives ballot paper, it should be 
set aside for you to examine. 

After examining the ballot paper and making a determination on its formality, you must write 
on the back of the ballot paper ‘ADMITTED’ or ‘REJECTED’ according to your decision, and add 
your initials and the date. The ballot paper is then sorted to the candidate if admitted or to 
informal if rejected. 

Election Procedures Handbook – PPLO/OIC/2IC     Page 65


--- Page 67 ---

Decisions on the formality of Senate ballot papers are not made at the polling place. This 
means that scrutineers cannot object to the formality of Senate ballot papers at a polling 
place. Scrutineers will have the opportunity to object to the formality of Senate ballot papers at 
the Central Senate Scrutiny conducted under the authority of the Australian Electoral Officer 
for each state/territory. 

Work area 

The following diagrams show key principles to follow when setting up the work area. Please 
note: 

▪  As a principle, unfolding is marginally faster than sorting so you should have 
slightly more staff sorting than unfolding. If sorting staff are being starved of 
unfolded ballot papers in the production line, they can be allocated a small bundle 
of ballot papers to unfold and then sort on their individual table. 

▪  To minimise cross over of staff, sorters should generally stay seated and the 

unfolder/runners move the ballot papers as required. This includes assisting the 
OIC to allocate bundles of ballot papers ready to be counted/check counted, and 

▪  Unfolder/runners can also assist with counting ballot papers if required. 

After 6pm 

After 6pm on polling day, instruct any staff not involved in the collection and reconciliation of 
material, or the reconciliation of declaration votes, to dismantle remaining cardboard polling 
equipment and set up all tables needed for the scrutiny (if not already done). 

You need to organise your available space so that you have room for: 

1.  House of Representatives area for unfolding and sorting/counting 
2.  Senate area for unfolding and sorting/counting (this can progressively get bigger as the 

House of Representatives scrutiny finishes) 
3.  completion of returns and other paperwork, and 
4.  packaging of election materials. 

Election Procedures Handbook – PPLO/OIC/2IC     Page 66

Election Procedures Handbook – PPLO/OIC/2IC     Page 67


--- Page 69 ---

Reconciliation of material 

Before you begin the scrutiny, instruct ordinary and declaration vote issuing officers on the 
procedures for reconciling material and returning it to you, keeping each issuing point’s 
material separate. Only after reconciling at issuing point level and recording on the relevant 
worksheets and forms, may material be merged. If there is a 2IC, they should coordinate the 
reconciliation of declaration voting material.  

As material is returned to you, arrange it ready for packaging. More information is provided on 
page 79. 

Reconciliation of ordinary votes 

Ordinary issuing officers should be instructed to count all unused ballot papers and complete 
the Certified list coversheet fields by tallying total ballot papers received, spoilt, unused and 
then issued. 

Reconciliation of declaration votes 

At 6pm the declaration vote ballot boxes are opened and each declaration vote issuing officer 
is to check and reconcile ballot papers, counterfoils, and declaration envelopes on the Ballot 
paper tracking form.  

Give each declaration vote issuing officer an ‘After 6pm checklist for staff reconciling 
declaration votes’ found in your OIC return to help with this task. Every declaration vote issuing 
point must be reconciled separately. 

The number of envelopes for each division should match 
the ballot paper reconciliation for votes issued as well as 
match the counterfoils.  

▪  Counterfoils should have been sorted 

progressively throughout polling day into 
alphabetical order, first by division, then by voter’s 
family name and then given name. 

▪ 

If there is more than one declaration vote issuing 
point, after reconciling the issuing points 
separately, all counterfoils must be merged and sorted alphabetically by family name 
for each division and filed in the declaration vote counterfoil folder(s). 

▪  Declaration envelopes from all issuing points must then be merged and sorted 

alphabetically, first by division, then by family name and bundled behind a completed 
Declaration vote packaging card (EF097) for each division. 

▪  The bundles of declaration votes, counterfoil binders and any postal votes extracted 

earlier are to be packaged for return of materials. The same plastic ballot box(es) used 
for declaration voting will be used for this purpose. If envelopes/counterfoils don&#39;t 
reconcile, the declaration vote issuing officer should alert the OIC who should record 
the details in their OIC return. 

Election Procedures Handbook – PPLO/OIC/2IC     Page 68

Order of the scrutinies/counts 

Ballot papers must be counted in the following order: 

1.  House of Representatives – first preference 
2.  House of Representatives – two candidate preferred (TCP), and 
3.  Senate. 

You must phone the results through separately to the election night results team as soon as 
possible after each count has been completed.   

When counting one type of ballot paper, it is essential that the other types are kept separate 
and secure. However, the opening of the Senate ballot boxes and unfolding of all Senate ballot 
papers should occur before the completion of the count of the House of Representatives, to 
check for ballot papers that may have been put in the wrong ballot boxes. 

House of Representatives Scrutiny and Senate Count 

Scrutinies/counts are conducted using a production–line system that has three main tasks: 

1.  unfolding 
2.  sorting, and 
3.  counting. 

The sorting phase is the most time consuming 
component and can become congested 
depending on the space available. It is 
recommended that once a small number of ballot 
papers have been unfolded, gradually move 
some staff to sorting and then counting to form a 
production line. If some staff seem slower at 
sorting ballot papers than others, swap them to a 
different task if possible. 

The areas should be set up so that any 
scrutineers have full access to observe and 
record the results of the count. 

Opening the ordinary ballot boxes  

Note: Ensure that there are no voters in the polling place when a ballot box is opened. 

Wash hands or use hand sanitiser before and after handling security seals. 

Before you open a ballot box you must check the seals in the presence of polling officials and 
scrutineers.  

You, as the OIC and a witness must sign the Record of ballot boxes and security seals in the 
OIC return.  

Sort cards 

The sorting area should be set up making sure:  

▪ 

▪ 

there is a sort card for each candidate or group as appropriate for House of 
Representatives or Senate ballot papers, and 
there is a sort card for informal ballot papers and for ‘queries’ for you to examine if 
a scrutineer has objected to a ballot paper.  

Election Procedures Handbook – PPLO/OIC/2IC     Page 69


--- Page 71 ---

Sort cards should be placed along the table in the same order as the candidates/groups 
appear on the ballot paper. 

Ballot paper formality 

There are principles and guidelines that must be followed when deciding if a ballot paper is 
formal and can therefore be counted.  Please read the Ballot Paper Formality guide starting on 
page 102. 

House of Representatives scrutiny procedure 
Following the close of poll, the counting of ballot papers must be undertaken using the 
following process and taking account of physical distancing requirements.  

Sort cards should be laid out on individual sort tables in order of the candidate names on the 
ballot paper. Then: 

Unfolding 

▪  Empty ballot box onto initial table. 
▪  Unfolder/runner takes ballot papers from initial table, unfolds at their individual 

table into neat piles. Sorters can also be allocated a small bundle of ballot papers 
initially to unfold to get started. 

▪  As piles of unfolded ballot papers are generated, unfolder/runner delivers to any of 

the sort tables.  

Sorting 

▪  Allocated staff will sort ballot papers on their individual tables to sort cards. Raise 
hand for unfolder/runner to deliver more unfolded ballot papers as required. 
If any ballot papers are being challenged by scrutineers, the unfolder/runners can 
periodically take them from the sort tables to the central table for the OIC to 
review. 

▪ 

Once a staff member has sorted all available ballot papers, the staff member should raise 
hand for unfolder/runner to collect ballot papers and place them on central table. When 
sorting ballot papers, make sure that:  

▪  each ballot paper is examined for formality 
▪  ballot papers are sorted and placed in piles according to first preferences by 

▪ 

▪ 

candidate 
informal ballot papers are placed in a separate pile to one side for you to check, 
this includes ballot papers where staff are unsure as to the formality 
if the formality of a ballot paper is objected to by a scrutineer, the ballot paper 
should be placed in a ‘queries’ pile for you to check and determine whether they 
are formal or informal. You must write on the back of the ballot paper ‘admitted’ or 
‘rejected’ and add your initials and the date, 

Election Procedures Handbook – PPLO/OIC/2IC     Page 70


--- Page 72 ---

▪  ballot papers for other divisions are placed on the queries pile. 

•  ballot papers for guest divisions (i.e. ordinary votes) are admissible and 

should be collated with a clearly marked sort card for transfer to the correct 
count. If occurring on-site, this can be given to the relevant supervisor. If 
not, the ballot papers should be parcelled, details recorded on the 
Discrepancies form in the OIC return, packaged with other House of 
Representatives ballot papers, and returned with other materials to the OPC 

•  ballot papers for divisions who were not guests in the polling place are 

informal 

Counting 

▪  Once all ballot papers are placed on central table, OIC allocates individual 

candidate piles back to sorters to count. Unfolder/runners to assist with moving 
ballot papers. OIC will need to consider size of piles and potentially split the major 
candidates across multiple tables to count. Unfolder/runners can also be allocated 
ballot papers to count at their individual tables. 

▪  As the ballot papers are being counted the polling official is re-checking that the 

number ‘1’ is for the correct candidate.  

▪  Formal ballot papers for each candidate are counted into bundles of 50 then 

secured with a rubber band. It is recommended counting into 5 piles of 10 ballot 
papers, then combining the piles to make a bundle of 50.  
Any bundle with less than 50 should have the amount recorded on a post-it note 
which is stuck to the top of the bundle and secured with a rubber band. Raise hand 
to notify OIC.  

▪  Unfolder/runners or OIC return ballot papers to central table. OIC then allocates to 
a different staff member to check count each candidate. (Note: staff to raise hand 
during counting if any mis-sorts are identified so that the runner can reallocate to 
the correct candidate/informal). 

▪  Whilst ballot papers are being counted, the OIC can check the informal pile and 

review any remaining queried ballot papers. 

Election Procedures Handbook – PPLO/OIC/2IC     Page 71


--- Page 73 ---

▪  Once check counted, staff raise hand to notify OIC. Unfolder/runners assist with 

returning ballot papers to central table where OIC writes the total number of ballot 
papers on the sort card which is placed on the top bundle and secured with a 
further rubber band around all bundles for that candidate. 
Informal ballot papers are then counted and bundled the same way as the formal 
ballot papers. 

▪ 

Do not write on ballot papers (except to note ‘Rejected’ or ‘Admitted’ on the back of ballot 
papers that were challenged by a scrutineer). Use rubber bands to bundle House of 
Representatives ballot papers – do not fold or roll ballot papers. 

You may find that not all staff are utilised once you get to the counting phase. Progressively 
move staff from the House of Representatives scrutiny to the Senate count once they have 
completed. 

Recording results 

When counting is finished the OIC records the number of first preference votes for each 
candidate and the number of informal ballot papers on the Result of count - House of 
Representatives sheet in the OIC return. 

Reconciliation 

You must check that the total count of ordinary ballot papers agrees with the number of ballot 
papers issued on the House of Representatives – Worksheet form in the OIC return. 

If the total number of formal, informal, spoilt, and unused ordinary ballot papers is less than 
the number issued, staff should check to see whether any ballot papers have been overlooked. 

You should check all ballot boxes and conduct a general check of the premises. 

Do not check bins, due to potential risks from discarded objects. 

If necessary, do one recount. If there is still a small difference, it may be due to voters not 
placing both their ballot papers in the ballot boxes.  

Balancing errors commonly occur because of: 

inaccurate counting of ballot papers before polling 
▪ 
▪  a miscount of unused ballot papers at the end of polling 
▪  ordinary votes placed in incorrect division’s ballot box (if a dual or multi) 
including discarded declaration ballot papers in the total figures, or 
▪ 
▪  not including the OIC’s unallocated ballot papers in the total number of unused 

papers in the ballot paper reconciliation. 

Do not take any more time by searching or recounting again. This will delay the release of 
results. 

When satisfied with the figures the details are to be recorded on the House of Representatives 
worksheet form in the OIC return. 

Election Procedures Handbook – PPLO/OIC/2IC     Page 72


--- Page 74 ---

Telephoning results 

A dedicated phone number for results will have been provided in your OIC return. You will need 
to provide your name, polling place name and OIC Identification. The OIC Identification is 
provided in the TCP envelope in the OIC return. 

You must make three separate phone calls in total to the divisional office; one at the 
conclusion of each count. Phone in the results of each count as soon as possible. 

Do not end the phone call until told to do so by divisional staff.  

If there is no phone or mobile phone coverage inside the polling place, you must remain in the 
room and have another polling official make the phone call. 

Two candidate preferred scrutiny procedure 

Introduction 

The two candidate preferred (TCP) scrutiny takes place in all polling places where more than 
two candidates are contesting the election on the House of Representatives ballot papers. The 
AEC selects two ‘major’ candidates and provides you with their names in a sealed envelope 
which is not to be opened prior to 6pm. This envelope will be included with the OIC return. 

Preferences from the ballot papers for all other ‘minor’ candidates are distributed between the 
two major candidates. 

The TCP count should be performed by you and/or the 2IC, and if necessary another polling 
official selected by yourself. It takes place after the first preferences of all House of 
Representatives ballot papers have been counted and phoned in. 

The TCP count provides an indication of the likely outcome of the poll in that division. 

All staff not involved in the TCP should be moved on to the 
Senate count. 

Procedure 

At the completion of the House of Representatives scrutiny 
of  first  preference  votes  the  TCP  scrutiny  should  be 
conducted  by  the  OIC/2IC  at  the  central  table.  In  larger 
polling places the second officer involved in the scrutiny can 
assist from a separate table. 
 The process is as follows: 

1.  Set aside the first preference ballot papers for the two candidates selected by the AEO 
as being the most likely to be elected and the informal ballot papers. These ballot 
papers are not touched as part of the TCP count. The ballot papers from other 
candidates are not amalgamated with these ballot papers at any time.  

2.  Choose a remaining candidate and sort ballot papers to the selected candidates. To 

determine the correct candidate to sort the ballot papers to: 

a.  examine the preference marks against the two selected candidates to 

determine which is more preferred. The candidate that is more preferred will be 
represented by the number closest to 1, i.e. 2 is more preferred than 5. 

b.  Sort the ballot papers to the more preferred candidate. 

Election Procedures Handbook – PPLO/OIC/2IC     Page 73


--- Page 75 ---

3.  Count the number of ballot papers allocated to each selected candidate and record the 

result on the TCP worksheet. 

4.  Return the ballot papers to their original first preference bundles, sorting back to piles 

of 50. 

Repeat this process for all candidates other than the two selected candidates. 

TCP preference examples 

In the following examples, Peters and Mathews have been selected as the major candidates. 
The following ballot papers were sorted to minor candidates and will be sorted to the major 
candidates as described: 

Example 1: Mathews is the more preferred candidate, as the voter has given fourth preference 
to Mathews, whereas Peters is fifth preference. The paper is sorted to Mathews. 

Example 2: Peters is the more preferred candidate, as the voter has given third preference to 
Peters, whereas Mathews is fifth preference.  The paper is sorted to Peters.  

Example 3: Peters is the more preferred candidate, as the voter has given Peters second 
preference before third preference to Mathews.  The paper is sorted to Peters.

  3) 

Recording results 

Record the TCP figures on the Result of Count – two candidate preferred worksheet in the OIC 
return. 

For each minor candidate, ensure that: 

▪ 
▪ 

their preferences are counted to one of the major candidates, and 
the total number of votes distributed to major candidates agrees with the total 
number of votes recorded for the minor candidate. 

Election Procedures Handbook – PPLO/OIC/2IC     Page 74


--- Page 76 ---

The ballot papers for each minor candidate are then placed back with their original sort card 
(1st preference sort) in rubber banded bundles of 50. 

Do not amalgamate these ballot papers with those of other candidates – keep them bundled 
separately by first preference for each candidate. 

Continue these steps until all the minor candidates have had their preferences counted. 

Ensure that the figure shown in the TCP total column agrees with the ‘Total 1st preference’ 
recorded on the Result of Count - House of Representatives sheet. 

Telephoning results 

Once the totals are recorded, phone the results through to the divisional office immediately, do 
not wait for all three scrutinies to be complete. 

You will be required to provide your name, polling place name and OIC identification when you 
phone in your results. 

Senate count 
The count of Senate ballot papers carried out at polling places is not considered a scrutiny. 
This means that at the polling place you do not make decisions on the formality of Senate 
ballot papers. You will, however, need to separate out the obviously informal ballot papers 
which cannot be allocated to any group because they are blank, indicate more than one first 
preference or do not indicate a first preference for any candidate. The scrutiny of Senate ballot 
papers is undertaken at the Central Senate Scrutiny (CSS) centre in the weeks following polling 
day. Scrutineers have the opportunity to challenge the formality of Senate ballot papers at the 
CSS. 

Polling officials are doing a preliminary count by first preference. Only those ballot papers that 
are obviously informal (i.e., no first preference or more than one first preference) will be 
included in the informal pile. 

Election Procedures Handbook – PPLO/OIC/2IC     Page 75


--- Page 77 ---

The Senate ballot paper consists of two sections – above the line and below the line (see 
figure below). The boxes above the line represent the group of candidates listed vertically 
below the line. Electors can vote above the line for groups (whether these group boxes are 
endorsed and thus labelled with a party name or not); or for individual candidates below the 
line.  

When preparing for the count, sort cards should be laid out for the four major groups above 
the line, one card for the remaining above the line groups, and one card for all votes below the 
line on sorting tables. Then there should be central tables for each of the four major groups. 
The procedure for the Senate count is as follows: 

Unfolding 

▪  Empty ballot box onto initial table. 
▪  Unfolder/runner takes ballot papers from initial table, unfolds at their individual table 
into neat piles. Sorters can also be allocated a small bundle of ballot papers initially to 
unfold to get started. 

▪  As piles of unfolded ballot papers are generated, unfolder/runner delivers to any of the 

sort tables.  

Sorting 

▪  Sorters sort ballot papers at 

their individual tables according 
to the first preferences shown 
for each group. It is quicker to 
initially sort to these top three or 
four groups and place all other 
ATL votes in a separate pile, as 
well as a separate pile for BTL 
and informal. Any ballot papers 
marked both ATL and BTL 
should be sorted to the BTL pile. 
Raise hand for unfolder/runner 
to deliver more unfolded ballot 
papers as required. 

▪  Once a sorter has completed all 
ballot papers, raise hand for 
unfolder/runner to collect ballot 
papers and place them on 
central sort table. 

Election Procedures Handbook – PPLO/OIC/2IC     Page 76


--- Page 78 ---

▪  The first four piles can then be transferred to individuals to count (below) while a small 
group of sorters can then progressively be moved to sort the ‘ATL Other’ pile. Use sort 
cards across a number of tables, sorters will need to move around and place the ballot 
papers with their sort cards in group order. 

▪  Note: Sort cards should be marked with the letter(s) that represent that group on the 
ballot paper, for instance A, B, C etc., as it is easier to sort to the letter(s) than to the 
group party name. 

▪  The BTL votes are then to be sorted to their Group, i.e., a first preference for any BTL 
candidate under Group C will be sorted to Group C. Ungrouped candidates are to be 
sorted to individual candidates. 

Sort to piles next to the ATL piles (do not merge ATL with BTL) and to separate piles for any 
ungrouped candidates.  

Counting 

▪  Once all ballot papers are placed on central table, OIC allocates individual piles back to 
sorters to count. Unfolder/runners assist with moving ballot papers. OIC will need to 
consider size of piles and potentially split the major candidates across multiple tables 
to count. Unfolder/runners can also be allocated ballot papers to count at their 
individual tables. 

▪  To count the ballot papers, individuals should place them face up so that the first 

preference can be checked as you count. 

▪  Count the ballot papers into bundles of 50 and secure with a foldback (or bulldog) clip. 
Any bundle with less than 50 ballot papers should be identified by writing the number 
of ballot papers on a post-it note, and sticking it to the top of the bundle, then securing 
the bundle with a foldback clip. (Note: staff to raise hand during counting if any mis-
sorts are identified so that the runner can reallocate to the correct 
candidate/informal). 

▪  The counter should then raise hand to notify OIC. Unfolder/runners or OIC return ballot 

papers to central table.  

▪  Do not fold or roll ballot papers. 
▪  The OIC will then write the number of ballot papers for each group on the sort card and 
secure the card with the foldback clip on the top bundle.  Do not write on ballot papers. 
▪  Record each total first preference vote for each group on the Result of count – Senate 

worksheet in the OIC return.  

▪  Whilst ballot papers are being counted, the OIC can check the informal pile and deal 

with any remaining queried ballot papers. 

▪  Unfolder/runners assist with returning ballot papers to central table where OIC 
completes sort cards and records first preference results on the results slip. 

▪  Once all ballot papers, including informals, have been counted, and totals recorded on 
the Senate Result of count phone-in slip, BTL ballot papers should be merged into one 
bundle and packaged as “BTL”.  

Election Procedures Handbook – PPLO/OIC/2IC     Page 77


--- Page 79 ---

1.  Use a new sort card labelled “BTL”.  
2.  Merge all BTL bundles into one, make new bundles of 50 from any bundles that did 

not add up to 50 in the sort (for example if you had 20 ballot papers in a bundle from 
Group A and 30 in a bundle for Group D, merge these together). Ensure all post-it 
notes are removed except if there is one remaining bundle that has less than 50 ballot 
papers.  

3.  Record the total number of BTL 

votes for the polling place on the 
sort card and secure it with the 
foldback clip to the top bundle. 

Unused Senate ballot papers 

Unused ballot papers that are still in bundles of 100 from the original allocation do not need to 
be re-bundled after polling. 

All other unused Senate ballot papers are to be counted into bundles of 50, with any 
remainders on top with the number recorded on a post-it note. Foldback clips should be used 
to secure bundles. Do not fold or roll ballot papers. 

Write the total number of unused ballot papers on a sort card labelled “Unused” and secure 
the card to the top bundle with the foldback clip.  

Telephoning results 

Once you are satisfied with the calculations on the Senate Result of count phone-in slip, phone 
these totals through to the divisional office. You will be asked to provide your name, polling 
place name and OIC Identification. 

Once results are phoned through the ballot papers and remaining election materials need to 
be parcelled and packaged ready for return of materials to the hub/out-posted centre. That 
process is covered in Packaging election materials, see page 79.  

Final duties 
As staff finish their scrutiny duties, they should help with the following: 

▪  dismantling any remaining polling place equipment 
▪ 
▪ 
▪ 
▪  making sure that premises are left tidy and in the condition agreed to when the 

removing any remaining signs or posters 
inspecting the premises to make sure no election material has been overlooked 
returning furniture to its proper place, and 

building was hired. 

Election Procedures Handbook – PPLO/OIC/2IC     Page 78


--- Page 80 ---

No staff should leave until all packaging and tidying is complete. 

You are responsible for returning premises keys according to the agreed arrangements. 

OIC returns 

Once you have completed your last day of polling you must complete your OIC return, see page 
28 for details on completing the return. 

Once completed the OIC return is packaged with the materials that are returned as instructed  

Packing election materials 

Introduction 

You will be provided with plastic bags, labels, tamper evident tape and various other packaging 
materials.  

Material is to be packaged using these supplies and in accordance with packaging 
instructions.  The Parcelling and packaging quick reference guide handout can be provided to 
staff to assist. 

You must comply with these instructions. Failure to do so may result in staff re-packaging 
material at the designated delivery point. 

Returning materials 

Remember to follow specific instructions issued in the Preparation Guide for the return of all 
materials. 

Unless otherwise directed OICs will transfer custody of all material to the designated Scrutiny 
Assistant for return to the location as instructed. 

Election material must be securely transported inside an enclosed vehicle (improvised 
enclosures such as tarpaulins over open tray utilities are not permitted), and supervised at all 
times. 

If the material is to be returned by a courier, all materials must be collected by the approved 
courier with consignment labels attached to all packages being returned. 

Election Procedures Handbook – PPLO/OIC/2IC     Page 79


--- Page 81 ---

Preparation 

Following polling you should set aside an area for packaging of materials.  This area needs to 
be large enough for you to lay out all labels and bags side by side. When you have finished with 
any particular item, place it next to the label that has that item listed on it. At the end of the 
night, it should then be a simple exercise to place the materials into the bag or transport 
container with the appropriate label. 

No rubbish or recycling should be placed near ballot papers and materials to be packaged. 

Approved labels for polling material 

Only approved labels may be used for packaging of election materials.  

Each label describes the contents of the parcel or package. Strict attention is to be paid to 
ensure the correct material is placed with the right labels. 

Record the polling place name on every label if it’s not already printed on there and ensure you 
complete any necessary information on the label and sign it. 

Label 1 – Administration records 

Label 1 package should be the last to be sealed (with tamper evident tape). It must include the 
OIC return as well as the polling place attendance record, which must be signed by all polling 
staff. 

Ensure that the OIC return has been completed accurately and that it has been signed and 
witnessed as required. 

Label 2 – Declaration vote materials  

Label 2 package must contain the completed Absent and provisional vote envelopes, 
declaration counterfoils in the red counterfoil folder(s), completed postal votes and cancelled 
postal votes. The plastic declaration ballot box(es) are to be used as the secure containers for 
packaging declaration vote materials.  

Containers must be sealed with plastic seals and the 
Record of security seals form completed. Complete the 
label and place it in the container window. 

Only folders containing counterfoils should be packaged 
in Label 2. Once counterfoils have been merged, any 
empty folders should be packaged with Label 8. 

Label 3 – Enrolment 

Label 3 package must contain all elector information reports, the envelope containing 
completed enrolment forms and scrutineer appointment forms and be sealed with tamper 
evident tape. 

Label 4 – Certified lists 

When completing Label 4 ensure you include the number of certified lists that have been 
included in the package, then seal with tamper evident tape. 

Election Procedures Handbook – PPLO/OIC/2IC     Page 80


--- Page 82 ---

Label 5 – House of Representatives ballot paper stubs parcel  

Label 5 is used for House of Representatives ballot paper stubs. The ballot paper stubs must 
be placed in an individual parcel, labelled with Label 5 and sealed with tamper evident tape. 
The Label 5 parcels are placed into the Label 5A ballot paper transport container. 

Label 5a – Ballot paper transport container (House of Representatives) package 

Label 5a is for all securely fastened containers that contain House of Representatives ballot 
paper bundles, bundled spoilt/discarded envelopes and the Label 5 ballot paper stubs parcel. 
Containers must be securely fastened with plastic seals and the Record of security seals form 
completed. Complete the label and place it in the container window. 

Label 6a - Ballot paper transport container (Senate) package 

Label 6a will be used for all ballot paper transport containers that contain bundles of sorted 
Senate ballot papers, including formal, unused, informal and spoilt and discarded ballot 
papers. Ballot paper transport containers must be sealed with plastic seals and the Record of 
security seals form completed. 

Complete the label and place it in the container window.  

Label 8 – Materials 

This package should contain all other materials, such as badges, handbooks, unused 
enrolment forms, calculators, voter screen 
plastic inserts etc., as listed on the label. It 
must be sealed with tamper evident tape. 

Bundling, parcelling and packaging 
of ballot papers 

Bundling 

During the House of Representatives and 
Senate scrutinies, ballot papers are sorted to 
individual candidates or groups and bundled to 50s. There will also be bundles of informal, 
spoilt, discarded and unused ballot papers.  

Each sorted bundle must include the sort card. 

To prevent them becoming unbundled in the transport container, place any large House of 
Representatives bundles (usually just the top 2-3 candidates) into separate plastic bags with 
the sort card visible. These do not need to be labelled or sealed with tamper evident tape. 

Parcelling  

House of Representative ballot paper stubs must be parcelled into a sealed bag before they 
can be packaged for transport. 

A completed Label 5 (House of Representatives) indicating the contents must be affixed to the 
front of the parcel, with tamper evident tape used to secure the parcel. 

No other ballot papers will be parcelled. 

Election Procedures Handbook – PPLO/OIC/2IC     Page 81


--- Page 83 ---

Packaging 

Bundles of House of Representatives and Senate ballot papers must be packaged ready for 
transport using the following steps: 

▪  place bundles into the relevant ballot paper transport container 

▪  complete Label 5a (House of Representatives) or Label 6a (Senate) listing the contents 
of the transport container, have it witnessed by a scrutineer (or polling official if a 
scrutineer isn’t available) and place the label in the container window, and 

▪  seal the container and complete the Record of security seals form, placing the form 

behind the label in the container window. 

When packaging Senate ballot papers, any groups that add up to more than 500 will have to 
be packaged into more than one transport container. If this happens use another sort card to 
identify the remaining bundles from the group, for example if your polling place has 600 ballot 
papers sorted to ATL Group C, 500 of them should go in one transport container with a sort 
card that says “ATL Group C” and 600 as the total. The remaining 100 will go in the next 
transport container with a sort card that says “ATL 
Group C”, but does not identify how many ballot papers. 
Ensure only one sort card records the number of ballot 
papers in the group. 

Packaging declaration vote envelopes 

Place reconciled and sorted declaration envelope 
bundles into the plastic container (ballot box) used for 
declaration voting, along with the counterfoils folder(s) 
that contain counterfoils and postal votes handed in.   

Complete Label 2, have it witnessed by a scrutineer (or 
polling official if a scrutineer isn’t available) and place the label in the container window.  

Seal the container with plastic seals (ensure it is sealed on two sides and the top flap) and 
complete the Record of security seals form, placing the form in the container window behind 
the label. 

Packaging other election materials 

Continue packaging all other election materials using the following steps: 

▪  complete the label indicating the contents of the package (label must be signed 

and witnessed) 

▪  affix the label to the front of the package, do not cover the label with tamper 

evident tape, and 

▪  Label 1 package should be sealed last as this is the package that contains the OIC 
return. Ensure that the OIC return is complete and the attendance record is signed 
before sealing this parcel.   

Note: If the contents of any label require more than one package, ensure you label each of 
them and note the total number of packages.

Employment and external 
stakeholder information 

Employment conditions 

Work health and safety 

Under Commonwealth legislation, staff have a general work health and safety duty of care to 
themselves and to others.  To enable OICs and their staff to take responsibility for ensuring 
that the polling place is a safe and healthy area for all staff and members of the public, here 
are a number of WHS actions that must be undertaken: 

1.  Instructing a polling staff member to complete the Safety Inspection checklist prior to 

the start of polling. 

2.  Providing a WHS briefing to all staff prior to the start of polling, with a check-in at the 

end of the workday. 

3.  On polling day if an incident occurs, this needs to be reported by using the Incident 

Notification Form in the OIC return.   

4.  If at any time you feel you are unfit to continue work on polling day/night you should 

inform the PPLO or divisional office. 

Preventing injuries 

To avoid potential injuries or illnesses, you must monitor staff workloads and fatigue levels, 
and ensure they take their scheduled breaks. You must also identify the safest and most 
convenient access route into the polling place, particularly for people with a disability or less 
mobile. 

To prevent slips, trips and falls, during the inspection ensure that: 

▪  entrances to the polling place are clear 
▪  electrical cords on floors have been taped down 
▪  any rubbish on floor areas is promptly removed 
▪  mats placed on a slippery floor have a non-slip backing 
▪ 

torn carpets or uneven floor surfaces are covered or appropriate warning signs 
provided 
traffic areas within and immediately outside the building are well lit, and 
▪ 
▪  other hazards, such as fatigue, are mitigated in consultation with the PPLO or 

divisional office. 

To prevent back injuries the OIC should ensure that staff use a trolley, or team lift, to move 
heavy or awkward items. Staff should be advised to:  

▪  avoid bending, twisting and rushing when lifting 
▪  stretch regularly 
take breaks from prolonged standing or sitting, and 
▪ 
▪  alternate task/duties where it is practical to do so.  

Election Procedures Handbook – PPLO/OIC/2IC     Page 83


--- Page 85 ---

Other safety considerations for managing incidents/injuries  

If a serious incident occurs, call the emergency services first and then contact the DRO 
immediately. Your primary duty is to ensure, as far as possible, the safety of all persons within 
the polling place. Procedures to follow for different types of emergencies are located in the 
Emergency Procedures booklet (also listed in Attachment 4). The DRO will assist with any 
further requirements. 

Note: For the safety of others, and to ensure legislative compliance, please cordon off the 
incident scene where it is reasonably practicable to do so until advised by the DRO that it is 
safe to release the area for use again.  

Every polling place will be provided with a basic first aid kit. These kits contain products to 
assist in treating minor injuries (e.g. paper cuts, splinters).  If an injury requires more attention 
or treatment then you must call 000.  

Liability for injuries that occur will be determined by the AEC’s regulator/insurer and will 
depend upon the circumstances relating to individual incident. Under no circumstances should 
an injured person be provided with an expectation that the AEC will pay medical accounts 
and/or make reimbursement for loss or damage to personal effects. Any queries, from voters, 
of this nature should be directed to the DRO. 

Harassment and bullying  

Workers, who include polling officials and scrutineers, are individually responsible for 
promoting a work environment free from harassment, bullying and discrimination.  

Workplace bullying is repeated and inappropriate behaviour that could reasonably be 
considered to be offensive, humiliating, intimidating, threatening or demeaning to a person or 
group of persons, which creates a risk to health and safety.  

Workplace harassment is any unwelcome, unsolicited and usually unreciprocated behaviour. It 
makes the workplace unpleasant, humiliating and intimidating and makes it difficult for 
effective work to be done.  

If there are any allegations of harassment and/or bullying you will need to complete the 
Incident Notification Form included in the OIC return, as this will allow the AEC to contact 
involved parties so that a review of the allegation can be conducted.  

Personal security 

All staff should be aware of the potential danger in exiting buildings late at night.  

If lighting is not adequate you should arrange to have someone accompany staff to their cars, 
with a torch if available. 

Bins 

Under no circumstances are scrutineers, party workers or polling officials to rummage through 
bins inside the polling place in order to recycle party literature, such as how–to-vote cards.  

There are health and safety reasons for this, and in addition the bins may contain discarded 
ballot papers placed there by voters. 

Smoking in the polling place 

Smoking in the polling place is strictly prohibited. This includes the 6-metre section 
immediately surrounding the premises.  

Election Procedures Handbook – PPLO/OIC/2IC     Page 84


--- Page 86 ---

Workplace diversity 

The AEC is committed to the principles and practices of workplace diversity. Through diversity, 
we foster an inclusive environment that values and utilises the contributions of people of 
different backgrounds, experiences and perspectives.  

Diversity relates to gender, age, language, ethnicity, cultural background, disability, sexual 
orientation and religious beliefs.  

Diversity also refers to the many ways people differ in other respects, such as educational 
level, job function, socioeconomic background, personality profile, geographic location, marital 
status and whether or not they have family or other care responsibilities. 

As the OIC you are responsible for ensuring that all staff are treated fairly and equitably and 
that they are given the same opportunity to perform the same range of duties. 

Customer service 

All staff employed by the AEC will provide a certain level of service to all our customers. Our 
customers include voters, scrutineers, party workers and candidates. 

As a temporary AEC employee you are required to be professional in your dealings with all our 
customers and to treat them with respect and courtesy. 

Property 

The AEC accepts no responsibility for the loss of property belonging to employees or for 
damage to their vehicles in getting to and from, or while at the polling place.  

Staff must therefore ensure that their personal property is safe and secure at all times. 

Meal breaks 
All staff should ensure they have adequate food and refreshments for the day as there may be 
limited opportunities for polling staff to leave the polling place, and limited availability of 
nearby facilities. Staff may also like to take other small items for personal comfort (e.g. a 
cushion). 

Requirement on polling day  

Legislation and AEC policy requires that staff must not work more than 5 continuous hours 
without taking a break of at least 30 minutes. AEC employees are obligated to take such a 
break as directed by the OIC. 

While it is preferable that a 30 minute meal break be provided to all polling staff, it is 
acceptable, during peak periods, for staff to have two 15 minute breaks for every 5 hours 
worked. 

Staff should be aware that the nature of the work during polling makes it difficult to schedule 
official meal breaks that correspond to accepted mealtimes.  Meal breaks are at the direction 
of the OIC and as far as possible the timing of breaks will be mutually agreed between you and 
your staff.  

Election Procedures Handbook – PPLO/OIC/2IC     Page 85


--- Page 87 ---

Managing meal breaks 

It is the responsibility of OICs to ensure that all staff, including yourself, take regular breaks. 

A break is considered to be time away from the actual polling area, in locations such as a tea 
room, kitchen, or outside the polling place. Staff should not eat or drink at the issuing tables to 
avoid the risk of spills on the certified lists or ballot papers. 

You will need to develop a roster before polling begins to ensure all staff are scheduled to take 
the required breaks throughout the day. The roster should be developed in consultation with 
staff to ensure that, as far as practicable, the break times are mutually agreed to. 

During peak polling periods (e.g. mornings on polling day), it may be more practical to provide 
staff with two 15 minute breaks rather than with a single 30-minute break, however, you must 
ensure that all staff take a break of at least 30 minutes duration at some point during the day.  
At no stage should a staff member have been on duty for more than 5 hours of continuous 
duty without having taken breaks of 30 minutes in total. 

There is an expectation that breaks will be available to staff throughout the whole working day, 
this includes during the count after polling. Following is a suggested plan to manage breaks 
during the count: 

▪  provide staff who are not directly involved in the reconciliation of ballot papers with 

a 15 minute break at 6pm 

▪  as staff complete their reconciliation, they take a 15 minute break 
▪  as each staff member completes that 15 minute break they resume after 6pm 

duties as required, and 

▪  ensure all staff take an additional 15 minute break during the scrutiny to ensure 

the requirement is not breached. 

Alternatively, scrutiny assistants arriving at 5pm may be utilised to cover the role of ballot box 
guard or queue controller to allow staff to have a break prior to the close of polling, 

If a staff member refuses to take their allocated breaks, you must explain the requirement to 
them and advise them that they will be in breach of work health and safety legislation. If they 
still refuse, inform the PPLO, ensure you record the incident in the Issues and miscellaneous 
matters form in the return and have another member of staff witness this entry. You must also 
record on this form any other issues associated with meal breaks. 

Election Procedures Handbook – PPLO/OIC/2IC     Page 86

Candidates, party workers and scrutineers 

Introduction 

Candidates, party workers and scrutineers have very different responsibilities and rights at 
polling places. 

Candidates 

Rights and responsibilities 

Candidates are not allowed to take part in any way in the conduct of an election for which they 
are a candidate.  

They may not be scrutineers and they may not enter a polling place except to record their own 
vote.  

They may, however, mix with party workers and voters outside the polling place in the 
approved area (i.e. 6 metres from the entrance to the polling place). 

Party workers 

Party workers will need to adhere to physical distancing measures and any health 
requirements in force at the time of polling.  

Party workers are expected to provide their own masks if they choose to wear them or if there 
is a requirement to wear a mask. 

Rights and responsibilities 

Party workers distribute how-to-vote material and encourage voters to vote for the party or 
candidate that they support. This is called ‘canvassing’.  

At polling places on polling day candidates and party workers are prohibited by the 
Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 from canvassing within 6 metres of an entrance to a 
polling place (see Electoral Backgrounder – Polling place offences at Attachment 5 for further 
information).  This provision should be enforced if the activities of party workers obstruct 
voters.  

At polling places on polling day, ensure that the ‘electoral offences’ sign is placed at the 
entrance to the polling place. 

Party workers may enter the polling place only once, to record their vote.  

An exception is made if a voter who needs help nominates a party worker to assist them. Party 
workers asked to assist voters must remove any political badges they are wearing and cover 
any political logos on clothing etc. before entering the polling place.  

Scrutineers 

Scrutineers will be asked to use hand sanitiser and maintain 1.5m distance when observing 
processes inside the polling place including the sealing of ballot boxes and scrutiny of ballot 
papers. Under no circumstances are scrutineers to touch ballot papers or ballot boxes.  

Election Procedures Handbook – PPLO/OIC/2IC     Page 87


--- Page 89 ---

The following hygiene provisions will be in place for scrutineers: 

▪  QR code check-in on relevant state/territory mobile phone app and manual sign-in 

sheets if unable to use QR code 

▪  hand sanitiser to be used on entry and exit (and as requested) 
▪  masks should be worn if physical distancing is not possible, both during polling and 

the scrutiny 

▪  scrutineers are expected to provide their own mask, and 
▪  scrutineers should also maintain hand hygiene while in attendance. 

Scrutineers play an important role in the election process. It is their job to observe that you are 
doing your job properly. 

During polling each candidate can be represented by one scrutineer per issuing point. 

During the scrutiny each candidate can be represented by one scrutineer per officer counting 
the votes.  

It is your responsibility to ensure that scrutineers and party workers do not breach the 
Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 or the Referendum (Machinery Provisions) Act 1984. 

Identifying scrutineers 

Scrutineers must present their appointment forms to you on arrival, and you must check to see 
that: 

▪ 
▪ 
▪ 

the name of the polling place has been entered 
the ‘undertaking by scrutineer’ on the form has been signed by the scrutineer, and 
the form has been signed by the candidate (a rubber stamp, facsimile or photocopy 
is sufficient). 

A scrutineer may also be appointed by fax or by an imaged signature attached to an email, but 
it must satisfy the above requirements.  

If these matters are in order, issue the scrutineer with a scrutineer’s badge. A scrutineer must 
always wear a scrutineer’s badge when inside the polling place. 

If there is no signature, the person cannot be appointed as a scrutineer. Anyone who seeks to 
be a scrutineer but who does not satisfy these requirements should be told to contact the 
party, candidate or campaign office. 

Scrutineers may come and go during polling, or they may be replaced by another scrutineer 
provided appointment forms are in order. 

Scrutineers are entitled only to exercise their responsibilities in the election for the candidate 
that appointed them. In a dual or multi polling place, this means only the division in which that 
candidate is running. 

Rights and responsibilities 

You should check with all scrutineers that they are aware of their rights and responsibilities as 
outlined in the Scrutineers handbook.  

You will be provided with copies of the Quick reference guides for scrutineers and party 
workers to issue to scrutineers or party workers who ask for information about their duties on 
polling day.  

Election Procedures Handbook – PPLO/OIC/2IC     Page 88


--- Page 90 ---

Quick reference guides are also designed to help you provide accurate information to 
scrutineers and party workers on their rights and responsibilities during polling and scrutiny. 

Scrutineers may: 

▪  observe all voting procedures except the voter actually voting, unless the voter is 

being assisted by a polling official 

▪  object to the right of any person to vote, and 
▪  be nominated by a voter to help with the completion of a ballot paper. 

Scrutineers must not: 

remain in a polling place without a scrutineer’s badge 
touch ballot papers unless a voter nominates them to assist 
interfere with, or attempt to influence, any voter 

▪ 
▪ 
▪ 
▪  disclose any knowledge gained concerning the vote of a person 
▪  wear a badge or emblem of a political party or candidate within the polling place 
▪  deliberately show or leave in the polling place any how-to-vote card or similar 

direction as to how a voter should vote  

▪  help with the clearing of voting screens or removal of material from the polling area 

or assist in transporting polling equipment, or 

▪  undertake an action that creates a hazard or otherwise impacts the health and 

safety of voters and staff. 

Objections 

If a scrutineer objects to any procedure, or questions staff in any way, staff should immediately 
refer the matter to you.  

Where a scrutineer objects to the right of any person to vote, the reasons must be recorded on 
the Issues and miscellaneous matters form in the OIC return. You must then advise the 
scrutineer that the person may still vote. The DRO will investigate in these circumstances.  

Media 

Media attendance at polling places 

The three main reasons for media to attend a polling place are to report on: 

1.  high profile candidates voting 
2.  voting incidents, or 
3.  voter intentions (exit poll) 

Each scenario is outlined below. It is essential that all media requesting access to a polling 
place, regardless of the scenario, comply with the behaviour requirements listed at the end of 
this section.  

High profile candidates voting 

It is quite common during an election for media to attend a polling place to capture footage of 
a high profile candidate casting their vote.  

Election Procedures Handbook – PPLO/OIC/2IC     Page 89


--- Page 91 ---

The AEC will endeavour, where possible, to gain advanced notice of this activity to inform 
polling staff of impending media presence. If a significant number of media is expected at a 
polling place the AEC will organise for representatives to be present to coordinate media 
requirements.  

Advanced notice is not always able to be achieved. Polling staff could encounter requests for 
media access – in the case of particularly high profile candidates this could be a number of 
media outlets present at the same time.  

Voting incidents 

If an incident has been identified, media should not be admitted to the polling place unless 
approved by the state/territory manager. If approval is provided, it is essential that media are 
fully aware of the behaviour requirements.  

In the event of a potential voting incident, no polling staff, including the OIC, should provide 
comment to the media under any circumstances. You should explain to the media that you are 
not authorised to provide comment and that they should contact the national media team on 
02 6271 4419, 0419 294 893 or media@aec.gov.au.  

Voter intentions (Exit polls) 

Journalists often like to conduct ‘exit polls’ in which voters are asked, after they leave the 
polling place, how they have voted.   

This activity should be conducted outside the polling place in accordance with the 
requirements outlined below. It is essential that exit polls do not disrupt the flow of the polling 
place and that voters are not pressured into revealing their secret ballot. 

Journalist or camera crew requesting to enter a polling place 

As the OIC, if you are asked by journalists and/or a camera crew if they may enter the polling 
place, you should: 

▪  Grant access to the journalist, unless a potential voting incident has been 

identified, in which case DRO approval should be sought. If the polling place is 
particularly busy you should ask the media if they can either return later or wait 
until you have time to accompany them. 

▪  Accompany the media while they are in the polling place and organise your 2IC to 
manage the flow of the polling place while you are busy. Alternatively, you can 
delegate your 2IC to accompany the media if there is another matter that requires 
your attention, and you are confident that your 2IC understands the behaviour 
requirements for media below and is able to enforce these. 

▪  Highlight the following three guidelines to the media for particular attention: 

o 

the flow of voting must not be interrupted - this means that no interviews can 
be conducted inside the polling place 

o  media are not allowed to photograph or film the ballot paper secure zone or 

o 

selections on a voter’s ballot paper 
the wishes of people who do not want to be photographed or filmed must be 
respected. 

Election Procedures Handbook – PPLO/OIC/2IC     Page 90


--- Page 92 ---

Behaviour requirements for media representatives in polling places 

To ensure the efficient conduct of both the voting and counting, access to a polling place 
granted by the AEC is conditional on the media complying with the polling place rules. 

You can refuse entry or ask a member of the media to leave if the following conditions are not 
met. 

▪  The operation of the polling place must be allowed to continue without disruption 

or any inconvenience to voters or polling officials. 

▪  Media must adhere to the direction of the Officer in Charge at all times. 
▪  Media are not allowed in the ballot paper secure zone. 
▪  Media are not allowed to film or photograph items in the ballot paper secure zone. 
▪  Any filming of a person voting must ensure that none of the voter&#39;s ballot paper 

selections can be identified. 

▪  The media must not touch any ballot papers or interfere with the operation of the 

voting or the count. 

▪  Particular scenes or results cannot be &#39;recreated&#39; for better effect. 
▪  Ballot papers and other AEC materials must not be removed from the polling place. 
▪  The rights of voters, polling officials and other members of the public in the polling 

place who do not want to be filmed must be respected. 

▪  The rights of scrutineers (candidate representatives) who wish to observe the count 

closely must be respected.  

Guidelines for media coverage in polling places are available on the AEC website at 
http://www.aec.gov.au/media/media-services.htm.  

Request for comment 

If the media asks for comment regarding voting, the operation of the polling place or any other 
matter you should refer them to your DRO or national media team on 02 6271 4419, 
0419 294 893 or media@aec.gov.au. 

Election Procedures Handbook – PPLO/OIC/2IC     Page 91


--- Page 93 ---

Troubleshooting 
Do not hesitate to contact your PPLO or divisional office if you require further guidance on ANY 
issue before, during or after polling. 

Issuing votes 

You cannot find a voter’s name on the certified list 

Issuing officers can ask voters for a form of identification if they are having genuine difficulty in 
understanding the voter’s name or locating the voter on the certified list. 

If the name cannot be found, the following may help. 

▪  Check the spelling with the voter. 
▪  Ask the voter to print the name on a piece of paper. 
▪  Ask the voter whether they might be enrolled under a different name. 
▪  The voter may be enrolled in another division. 
▪  On the certified list names beginning with ‘Mc’ are treated as if they are spelt 

‘Mac’. The apostrophe in names like O’Brien is ignored. Names beginning with ‘St’ 
are treated as if they are spelt ‘Saint’: 

Additional questions 

The following additional questions should only be asked if you are unsure of the voter’s identity 
after asking the first three questions.  

▪  What is your date of birth? and/or  
▪  What is your gender? 

If you still cannot find the name on the certified list, direct the voter to the declaration vote 
issuing point. 

The wrong name has been marked off the certified list 

If you make a mistake and mark the wrong name off the certified list, you must follow a three-
step correction procedure:  

Election Procedures Handbook – PPLO/OIC/2IC     Page 92


--- Page 94 ---

Step 1 Write the letter ‘W’ for ‘wrong’ in the left margin against the incorrectly marked name 
and indicate it clearly by drawing an arrow to the roll number. 

Step 2 Draw a firm black line from arrowhead to arrowhead on the error correction 
indicator in the top left corner of the same page.  

Step 3 Mark off the correct name. 

Voter refuses to have a provisional vote 

A voter that cannot be found on the certified list or is marked as already having voted, may 
choose not to have a provisional vote. If this happens, you must record the voter’s name and 
why they were not issued a vote in the Issues and miscellaneous matters form in the OIC 
return. 

If a voter wishes to complain, they should be asked to put their complaint in writing and submit 
it via the AEC website.  

When checking a declaration vote envelope you realise the wrong 
ballot paper was given to the voter 

If an incorrect ballot paper has been issued to a declaration voter, they must hand back the 
original ballot paper and be given the correct ballot paper using the spoilt ballot paper 
procedures, see page 54. 

Election Procedures Handbook – PPLO/OIC/2IC     Page 93


--- Page 95 ---

Declaration voter doesn’t return their completed ballot papers 

If a declaration voter leaves the polling place without returning to the issuing officer to hand in 
their completed ballot papers, the issuing officer must: 

▪  seal their declaration vote envelope  

▪  put it in the ballot box, and 

▪  write ‘ballot paper not returned’ on the counterfoil, and file. 

Running low on ballot papers 
You should monitor the allocation of ballot papers carefully throughout the day and inform the 
PPLO if you are getting low on unused ballot papers. The PPLO will provide more ballot papers 
as a priority.  

Photocopying ballot papers 

If you photocopy a ballot paper, it is essential that you initial it in the circle on the front before 
giving it to a voter. The OIC must record the quantity copied as an ‘allocation’ in their House of 
Representatives Worksheet and record details on the Issues and Miscellaneous Matters form 
in the OIC return.  

Be careful not to leave the original in the photocopier. 

Open ballot papers 

The number of open ballot papers you should receive is included in the ballot paper inventory. 

‘Open’ House of Representatives ballot papers are blank ballot papers that can be used if a 
polling place runs short of House of Representatives ballot papers and photocopying is not an 
option. 

The list of candidates booklet is used in the preparation of an open ballot paper, as follows: 

▪  PRINT the name of the state or territory and division at the top of the ballot paper 
▪  complete the ‘number the boxes’ section on the ballot paper (for the number of 

candidates on the ballot paper) 

▪  print the candidates’ names and party affiliations exactly as shown in the list of 

candidates booklet  
recheck the ballot paper against the list of candidates booklet, and 

▪ 
▪  cross out the unused section of the ballot paper below the name of the last 

candidate you have listed, using a ‘Z’ (two horizontal lines connected by a diagonal 
line). 

Amending ballot papers 

If you do not have a photocopier or “open” ballot papers, a ballot paper for another division 
can be altered (as pictured) to represent the correct division by crossing out the candidates’ 
names and party and following the steps in the open ballot paper instructions above.  

Election Procedures Handbook – PPLO/OIC/2IC     Page 94


--- Page 96 ---

Complaints/other issues 

Disturbances during polling 

If a disturbance occurs during the day, either inside or outside the polling place, you should try 
to solve the problem.  

In any situation, common sense should prevail.  

Contact your PPLO if you are concerned. 

Adjournment 

Voting may be adjourned or temporarily suspended if it is interrupted by a flood, fire, severe 
storm, outbreak of a riot or open violence, health hazard or any other reason related to the 
safety of voters.  

If, for any reason, it is considered that voting should be adjourned or temporarily suspended, it 
is vital that you attempt to telephone the DRO immediately.  

In this situation, the adjourned or temporarily suspended polling notice must be displayed at 
the polling place. The DRO will advise you of alternative voting arrangements, which may 
include resuming polling later that day or adjourning polling to another day. 

Removal of a person 

A scrutineer or any other person who commits any breach or misconduct, or who fails to obey 
your lawful directions, may be removed from the polling place at your request by the police.  

If this happens, you must document details in the Issues and miscellaneous matters form in 
the OIC return and obtain a statement from witnesses. You must also advise the PPLO as soon 
as possible. 

Cameras in the polling place 

Polling officials and scrutineers are not permitted to use any image recording device (including 
cameras, video recorders and mobile phones) to record images of ballot papers or declaration 
vote envelopes, or any other images that might identify a voter and how they have voted, in a 
polling place.   

You must be notified of anyone using an image recording device. 

Queues 

If queues are excessive and ongoing despite following the queue management and voter flow 
procedures, contact your PPLO to who can report the issue and see whether any assistance 
can be provided by the divisional office. 

Political signs and banners 

You may receive complaints from the public, or candidates, that large banners or signs are 
attached to buildings, fences or trees.  

At a polling place on polling day, provided that the banners or signs are outside the area that 
has been proclaimed part of a polling place by your ‘Electoral offences’ sign, their placement is 
not your responsibility. 

Election Procedures Handbook – PPLO/OIC/2IC     Page 95


--- Page 97 ---

You should advise complainants that the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 does not address 
the placement of signs outside the proclaimed area (six meters from the entrance to a polling 
booth).  

The removal or relocation of signs is a matter for the property owner and is covered by local 
government by-laws and/or state/territory legislation.  

For example, if someone complains that there are political signs on electricity poles in a street, 
the person should take the matter up with the electricity supplier for that region, not the AEC. 

However, if you consider that the banners or signs pose a danger to the public or obstruct 
access by voters, you should ask that they be relocated. 

Polling officials and scrutineers are forbidden to wear political messages on badges and 
clothing when in the polling place.  

However, voters are allowed to wear political messages on badges and clothing in the polling 
place. 

Party workers asked to assist a voter or to witness such assistance must remove promotional 
badges before entering a polling place.  

Ballot box opened before 6pm on polling night 
Under no circumstances should a ballot box that has been used to collect votes be opened 
before 6pm on polling night. If this happens votes may not be included in the count and voters 
will be disenfranchised.  

If a ballot box is opened prematurely the OIC must: 

▪  secure the opened ballot box 
▪  any ballot papers or declaration vote envelopes that have been removed must be 
placed in a bag and sealed with tamper evident tape and labelled with the ‘For 
investigation’ label. The OIC must complete and sign the label 

▪  complete the Prematurely opened ballot box report located in the OIC return, 

describing the circumstances in which the ballot box was opened, including details 
of any witnesses, and 
the DRO must be informed immediately. If the ballot box was opened through a 
malicious act you must bring this to the DRO’s attention. 

▪ 

All of the above, including the ballot box must be given to the DRO. 

If a ballot box has been intentionally or maliciously opened prematurely it is classified as a 
security incident and the DRO will need your input to report as much information as possible.

COVID-19 issues 

Outlined here and in Attachment 4 Polling place emergency procedures, there are a range of 
issues, incidents and disturbances that may occur at polling locations and appropriate 
responses, which may include calling authorities to assist. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, 
additional response measures must be put in place to protect the health and welfare of staff 
and voters. A range of scenarios are outlined below. Record details of any issues on the Issues 
and miscellaneous matters form (EF274) and/or the Incident notification form (EF270) as 
relevant and inform the PPLO immediately. 

Staff member attends a polling place with flu-like symptoms 

Ask them to go home. Staff and voters have been asked not to attend polling places if they are 
sick. Wash hands and sanitise any areas they were in contact with. Immediately inform the 
divisional office if additional staff members are needed. 

Voter says they are sick or a voter appears to have symptoms of 
COVID-19 

If someone seems ill, check if they are feeling ok first – do not make assumptions, there could 
be other reasons for their symptoms. If they are sick, advise the voter that people have been 
asked not to attend a polling place if sick. Ask the voter to leave and seek medical assistance 
and offer them a mask.  

If this occurs during early voting (up until the Wednesday before polling day), advise the voter 
they can apply for a postal vote online.  

Record the voter’s details (name, date of birth and address) on an EF016 elector information 
report and advise them that the details will be passed on to the division for consideration 
during the non-voter process.   

Direct the hygiene officer to sanitise any touch points the voter may have been in contact with. 

Voter advises a family member or friend has not attended polling 
because they are sick or self-quarantining 

If this occurs during early voting (up until the Wednesday before polling day), advise them the 
elector can apply for a postal vote online.  

Record the voter’s details (name, date of birth and address) on an EF016 elector information 
report and advise them that the details will be passed on to the division for consideration 
during the non-voter process.   

Voter attends polling and says they have COVID-19 

This issue must be taken seriously and may result in needing to adjourn polling. 

If the voter is inside the polling place: 

▪  Ask that they leave the polling place.   
▪ 

If the voter is intentionally threatening or refuses to cooperate, call the police to 
assist in removing the person from the polling place, should the behaviour threaten 
the safe delivery of polling. 

▪  Stop all voters from entering the polling place and advise them due to 

precautionary measures there will be a short wait until the polling place re-opens.  

Election Procedures Handbook – PPLO/OIC/2IC     Page 97


--- Page 99 ---

▪  Ask all voters already inside to leave the polling place. If they have received a ballot 
paper they can continue to finalise their vote, if they haven’t, ask them to go back 
outside to the front of the queue while the polling place is quickly sanitised. 

▪  Ask all polling staff to assist with touchpoint cleaning of all areas. 
▪  Staff members involved in the transaction may dispose of and replace their PPE as 

a precaution. This is in addition to washing or sanitising their hands. 

▪  When 15 minutes have passed and surfaces are clean, it will be safe to resume 

normal polling activities. 

▪  Ensure the DRO is informed and incident report forms completed in the OIC return. 

If the voter has not yet entered the polling place: 

▪  The queue controller should call the OIC to assist in managing the voter. 
▪  Ask that they leave the polling place.   

Voter coughing or spitting on ballot paper 

The OIC is authorised to remove a person from the polling place or request the police to do so, 
should their behaviour threaten safe delivery of polling.  

If the ballot paper is then discarded 

Use gloves to pick up the ballot paper and put it in a spoilt/discarded envelope and give it to 
the OIC for reconciliation. 

The ballot paper is then placed into the ballot box 

If the voter coughs or spits on a ballot paper and then puts it in the ballot box, ensure the 
incident is recorded and call the DRO. Extra precautions must be taken during the scrutiny. 
Instruct all officials involved in the count to wear gloves, regularly sanitise their hands and not 
touch their faces. Tables must be sanitised after the scrutiny. 

Ensure the DRO is informed and incident report forms completed in the OIC return. 

Voter intentionally coughing or spitting on polling officials or other 
voters, or general contact with someone else’s saliva or other body fluid 
such as blood 

The OIC is authorised to remove a person from the polling place or request the police to do so, 
should their behaviour threaten safe delivery of polling.  

COVID-19 is known to be transmitted via saliva and other body fluids. The following steps need 
to be taken: 

▪  wash the blood or saliva off your skin with soap and lots of running water 
▪  wash the blood or saliva out of your eyes, nose or mouth with lots of cold water – if 
you wear contact lenses, rinse before and after taking them out, and spit the water 
out after washing your mouth, and 
if your skin is broken, encourage the wound to bleed and rinse it thoroughly under 
running water – but don&#39;t scrub or suck the wound.  

▪ 

Advise the affected person to seek medical advice as necessary.  

Election Procedures Handbook – PPLO/OIC/2IC     Page 98


--- Page 100 ---

The hygiene officer will also need to immediately sanitise the affected area(s) and dispose of 
the paper towel.  Staff members involved should replace their PPE as a precaution.   

Ensure the DRO is informed and incident report forms completed in the OIC return. 

Surface or object contaminated with spit or other bodily fluid 

COVID-19 is known to be transmitted via saliva and other body fluids. The contaminated areas 
must be sanitised immediately and dispose of the paper towel in the bio-waste bin. Direct any 
staff involved to wash their hands and replace their PPE as a precaution. 

At an issuing point, if the top ballot paper at an issuing point is contaminated, use gloves to 
place it in a spoilt/discarded ballot paper envelope.

Attachment 1 Division finder guide 

The division finder is an alphabetical listing of all localities and some streets within a state or 
territory and is used to determine a voter’s enrolled division. 

Staff must always consult it to determine the correct division for any address. 

The division finder consists of three parts: 

1.  the front section, which includes instructions, a list of divisional office addresses and a 
list of institutions and establishments (such as universities and hospitals) that may be 
identified as a voter’s place of residence, 

2.  the locality section, and 
3.  the streets section. 

Note: the locality section should be the first section you refer to. 

Locality section 

Suburbs or localities wholly contained within a division will display the division name. In these 
cases the streets will not be listed in the division finder. 

For example, in this division finder, if 
the voter’s locality is Bartlet, their 
division is Waterford. 

If a locality includes areas in more than one division, comments may be provided to determine 
the correct division. 

For example, Rawland includes parts 
of the divisions of Milton and Brown, 
so it is necessary to ask the voter if 
they live in the Childers Council area, 
or the Suay Regional Council area. 

The Locality section will refer to the Street section when more information is required. 

For example, if the voter’s locality is 
Ryans, you need to refer to the Street 
section. 

Election Procedures Handbook – PPLO/OIC/2IC     Page 100


--- Page 102 ---

Street section 

Streets may also belong to more than 
one division.   

For example, an address in Alder Ave, 
Fulsome may be in the division of Brown 
or the division of Waterford.  

In this example, the house number 
determines the correct division.  

Election Procedures Handbook – PPLO/OIC/2IC     Page 101

Attachment 2 Ballot paper formality guide 

If you are unsure of the formality of any ballot paper you should always include them with the 
other informal ballot papers. 

Do not take unnecessary time examining ballot papers to determine formality.  If on first 
examination you are unsure of formality, include it with the other informal ballot papers.   

Do not enter into unnecessary discussion with scrutineers regarding formality as all ballot 
papers are re-examined after polling day. 

Authentic ballot papers 

Generally, a ballot paper will carry an official mark (watermark or printed security pattern) and 
the initials of the issuing officer. However, ballot papers that do not carry these markings are 
not necessarily informal, for example the OIC may have observed an issuing officer not initial a 
ballot paper and needed to remind them to do so, in this case the OIC would expect a number 
of ballot papers may be missing the initials. 

If you are unsure of the authenticity of a ballot paper, place it with the informal ballot papers in 
order for the DRO to decide if it is authentic or not. 

Identification of voter 

If, in your opinion, there is sufficient writing on the ballot paper for someone conducting a 
scrutiny to uniquely identify the voter, the ballot paper is informal. It may be easier to identify a 
voter if they have written their name on a ballot paper and come from a small community for 
example, however a common name in a large population would make it much harder to 
identify the voter. 

This ballot paper is formal. 

Election Procedures Handbook – PPLO/OIC/2IC     Page 102


--- Page 104 ---

Principles 

Introduction 

The following is information on how to determine the formality of ballot papers that are 
authentic and do not identify the voter. 

There are five over-arching principles that must be considered when determining the formality 
of any ballot paper: 

Principle one  

Start from the assumption that the voter has intended to vote formally  

The assumption needs to be made that a voter who has marked a ballot paper has done so 
with the intention to cast a formal vote.  

Principle two 

Establish the intention of the voter and give effect to this intention  

When interpreting markings on the ballot paper, these must be considered in line with the 
intention of the voter.  

Principle three 

Err in favour of the franchise 

In the situation where the voter has tried to submit a formal vote (i.e. the ballot paper is not 
blank or defaced), the concept of reasonableness should be applied to questions of formality 
and wherever possible be resolved in the voter’s favour. 

Principle four 

Only have regard to what is written on the ballot paper 

The intention of the voter must be unmistakable, i.e. do not assume what the voter was trying 
to do if it’s not clear – only consider what is written on the ballot paper. 

Principle five 

The ballot paper should be construed as a whole 

By considering the number in each box as one in a series, not as an isolated number, a poorly 
formed number may be recognisable as the one missing from the series. 

Election Procedures Handbook – PPLO/OIC/2IC     Page 103


--- Page 105 ---

Guidelines 

Introduction 

The following guidelines are to be used when judging ballot paper formality.  

Alteration by polling officials 

A fully printed ballot paper for a division may be altered to become a ballot paper for another 
division (i.e. the names of the candidates are crossed out by the issuing officer and the names 
of candidates for the other division are written in their place). 

▪ 

If a ballot paper does not contain the names of every candidate for the division, the 
vote is informal, irrespective of the way the voter has voted. 

▪  A ballot paper is acceptable with the surname only of a candidate, as long as no 

two candidates share a surname, as shown in this example: 

In the case of ballot papers prepared incorrectly by polling officials: 

▪ 

▪ 

▪ 

▪ 

If the candidate’s given names only are listed on the ballot paper, the vote is 
informal irrespective of the way the voter has voted. 
If the political party names are not all correctly listed (e.g. wrong party names listed 
against the candidates or party names not listed) the vote is formal if the voter has 
otherwise recorded a formal vote. 
If a ballot paper has the names of any candidate spelt incorrectly (provided the 
identity of the candidate is still clear) the vote is formal if the voter has otherwise 
recorded a formal vote. 
If a ballot paper has the names of the candidates in the wrong order, the vote is 
formal if the voter has otherwise recorded a formal vote. 

Election Procedures Handbook – PPLO/OIC/2IC     Page 104


--- Page 106 ---

House of Representatives ballot paper 

Consecutive series of numbers 

A House of Representatives ballot paper is only formal if the voter has indicated a first 
preference and consecutively numbered all boxes. A number in the series may not be repeated 
or skipped. See example 1 below. 

If one box is left blank and all other boxes have been numbered in a consecutive sequence 
starting with the number ‘1’, the ballot paper is formal.  

If any candidate has more than one vote, the ballot paper is informal. 

Overwriting 

Alterations to numbers will not make a ballot paper informal, provided the voter’s intention is 
clear, for example a number can be crossed out and another number written beside it.  See 
example 2 below. 

If a number is overwritten in a way that makes it impossible to read, then the ballot paper is 
informal. See example 3 below. 

Example 1. 

Example 2.  

Example 3. 

The ballot paper above  
is informal.   
The number 7 has been 
repeated. 

The ballot paper above  
is formal.   
There are eight consecutive 
numbers reasonably 
discernible. 

The ballot paper above is 
informal.   
The overwriting is 
indecipherable. 

Election Procedures Handbook – PPLO/OIC/2IC     Page 105


--- Page 107 ---

Acceptable forms of numbering  

Ticks () or crosses () are not acceptable forms of voting for House of Representatives and 
will result in informality, see example 1 below. 

Voters may use a consecutive series in various styles – such as: 

▪  numerals (1 2 3) 
▪  words (one two three) 
▪ 
▪  ordinal numerals (1st 2nd 3rd).  

roman numerals (I II III IV), and 

Provided the voter’s intention is clear and no number is repeated or skipped, a mix of the 
above styles can be used on the same ballot paper and still be formal, see example 2 below. 

Voters can use letters in a consecutive series (A, B, C etc.); provided A is the first preference 
and no letters are repeated or skipped. 

A mixture of letters and numbers will result in an informal ballot paper, see example 3 below. 

Example 1.  

Example 2. 

Example 3. 

The ballot paper above is 
informal. 
A tick is not a valid first 
preference mark 

The ballot paper above 
is formal. 
Numbers can be written as 
words or figures. 

The ballot paper above 
is informal. 
A mixture of numbers and 
letters has made the voter’s 
intention unclear. 

Election Procedures Handbook – PPLO/OIC/2IC     Page 106


--- Page 108 ---

Two Candidates only 

In the case of only two candidates on a ballot paper, if the voter has placed a “1” in the box 
beside a candidate and left the second box blank OR inserted any other number the ballot 
paper will be deemed formal. 

Empty boxes  

For House of Representatives ballot papers a single box may be left empty provided it is the 
last in the series and on the condition there is no marking in the box at all. A scribble or dot 
etc. in the final box will result in informality if it is not recognisable as the next number in the 
series. See example 1 below. 

Two or more empty boxes on a House of Representatives ballot paper results in an informal 
vote. See example 2 below. 

Placement of votes 

The vote can be made inside the box or beside the box or candidate name, provided the 
intention of the voter is clear. See example 3 below. 

Example 1. 

Example 2. 

Example 3. 

The ballot paper above 
is informal. 
No discernible figure in the 
eighth box, but there is a 
mark in it.  

The ballot paper above 
is informal. 
There are two empty boxes.  

The ballot paper above 
is formal.  
The figure beside the eighth 
box reasonably resembles a 
7.   

Election Procedures Handbook – PPLO/OIC/2IC     Page 107


--- Page 109 ---

Variations in handwriting 

Unconventional but recognisable variations in handwriting, such as placing a stroke through 
the vertical stem of the number 7 or an upward angular stroke before the familiar vertical 
stroke on the figure ‘one’, should not result in a ballot paper being informal, provided any 
variations result in a series of numbers and the voter’s intent is obvious. 

If a voter marks a ballot paper with words or figures in a language other than English, the ballot 
paper can be accepted if the voter’s intention is clear. 

The ballot paper above is formal. 
The figure in the fifth box reasonably resembles 
a 1 and the figure in the seventh box 
reasonably resembles a 7. 

Election Procedures Handbook – PPLO/OIC/2IC     Page 108


--- Page 110 ---

Candidate name substitution 

If the voter crosses out or replaces a candidate’s name on a ballot paper, that ballot paper is 
informal, see example 1 below. 

Note that this does not include cases where a fully printed ballot paper is altered to become a 
ballot paper for another division by a polling official. 

If a candidate name has been added to the ballot paper by the voter and been allocated any 
number except the last number, the vote is informal see examples 2 and 3 below. 

Example 1. 

Example 2. 

Example 3. 

The ballot paper above 
is informal. 
The voter has not indicated 
a preference for all  
candidates.  

The ballot paper above 
is formal. 
The voter has indicated  
a preference for all  
nominated candidates.  

The ballot paper above 
is informal  
The voter has not indicated 
a first preference.  

Election Procedures Handbook – PPLO/OIC/2IC     Page 109


--- Page 111 ---

Senate ballot papers 
As outlined on page 76, Senate ballot papers are to be sorted into first preference choice 
above the line (ATL), first choice below the line (BTL) (to group level) or obviously informal. 

A strict formality assessment of Senate ballot papers does not occur until the Central Senate 
Scrutiny process in the weeks after polling day. 

On election night if a Senate ballot paper does not have one and only one first preference 
either ATL or BTL then it is considered obviously informal. 

A ballot paper that is obviously informal ATL can still be formal BTL and vice versa. 

A ballot paper that has a first preference ATL and BTL should be sorted to the BTL pile. 

The following are examples of how various types of Senate ballot papers should be 
categorised. 

The above ballot paper would be categorised as obviously informal. There are two first 
preferences above the line.  

Election Procedures Handbook – PPLO/OIC/2IC     Page 110


--- Page 112 ---

The above ballot paper would be categorised as a first preference for Group B, ATL. There is a 
first preferences above the line for group B.  

The above ballot paper would be categorised as a first preference for Group G, ATL. 
Unendorsed groups do not have a group name or logo. There is one first preference ATL.  

Election Procedures Handbook – PPLO/OIC/2IC     Page 111


--- Page 113 ---

The above ballot paper would be categorised as a first preference for the relevant ungrouped 
candidate BTL. There is one first preference BTL.  

The above ballot paper would be categorised as a first preference for Group D, ATL. There is a 
single first preference mark ATL.  

Election Procedures Handbook – PPLO/OIC/2IC     Page 112


--- Page 114 ---

The above ballot paper would be categorised as obviously informal. There are two first 
preference marks ATL.  

The above ballot paper would be categorised as a first preference for Group A, BTL. There is 
one first preference BTL.

Attachment 3 Marking the certified list 

Scenario. 

Below is an example of the top of a page from a certified list.  In this scenario, a voter with the 
name Alexander Scott Bellis provides you with his name and address and informs you that he 
has NOT voted previously in this election. 

When marking the name of the certified list you accidently mark the name below: ‘Merilyn 
Margaret Bellis’. 

Using this example, mark off the name Merilyn Margaret Bellis and then use the correct 
procedure to mark off the correct name and indicate an error. 

Turn the page to see the corrections. 

Election Procedures Handbook – PPLO/OIC/2IC     Page 115


--- Page 117 ---

Marked certified list 

This is the way a certified list page looks when the issuing officer has followed the correct 
procedure when an error is made: 

▪  The incorrect name has been indicated with the letter W and an arrow pointing to 

the name. 

▪  The error indicator on the top left of the page has been marked to show that this 

page contains errors. 

▪  The correct name has been marked off the certified list.

Attachment 5 Polling place offences 

The Act, when describing offences uses different terms in different sections. In this 
Backgrounder definitions for these various terms are: 

a.  A &#39;polling booth&#39; is the location provided at a &#39;polling place&#39; where voting screens are 

available at which voters mark their ballot papers. 

b.  A &#39;polling place&#39; is the street address for the location at which a &#39;polling booth&#39; is 

located and at which voting takes place. 

c.  The &#39;person in charge&#39;, &#39;person in charge of premises&#39;, &#39;officer in charge&#39; and &#39;presiding 
officer&#39; are all terms used to describe the AEC official responsible for electoral activities 
in particular locations. 

d.  The &#39;officer-in-charge&#39; of each polling place is called the &#39;presiding officer&#39; during 

polling, from 8am to 6pm on election day. From 6pm, however, during the counting of 
the votes (the scrutiny), this officer is called the &#39;assistant returning officer&#39;. 

e.  A ‘early voting centre’ is a pre-poll voting office or office of a DRO at which applications 
for pre-poll votes may be made, or pre-poll ordinary voting is available for the election.  

Introduction 

1. Electoral Backgrounders are published by the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) to 
provide a basic introduction to electoral law, policy and procedures for the information and 
guidance of all interested parties. 

2. The AEC administers the conduct of federal elections under the provisions of the 
Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 (the Act). 

3. This Backgrounder provides introductory information in relation to offences under the Act 
relevant to polling. More information on some of the offences discussed below, or on those not 
directly relevant to polling activities, is contained in other Electoral Backgrounders. 

4. Readers should not rely on the information in this document as a statement of how the law 
will apply in any particular case. Accordingly, if you are in doubt about the interpretation of the 
law in particular circumstances you should seek your own independent legal advice.  

5. The Act is available on the Australian Government’s Federal Register of Legislation website. 
Unless otherwise specified, all references to sections are to sections of the Act. Also please 
note, the words &#39;voter&#39; and &#39;elector&#39; are used interchangeably throughout this publication. 

Offences 

Compulsory voting s. 245 

6. An elector is guilty of an offence if the elector fails to vote at an election unless they have a 
valid and sufficient reason. For more information on compulsory voting see Electoral 
Backgrounder: Compulsory voting.  

7. However, the effect of sections 231, 233 and 234 is that the voter is actually required to 
take the issued ballot paper(s) and to retire to the polling booth to mark their vote. It is not 
sufficient compliance to merely have your name marked off and then to leave the polling 
booth.  

8. If a person found guilty of this offence, a court may impose a penalty of 1 penalty unit. In 
addition, court costs may also be payable. The value of a penalty unit is set by section 4AA of 
the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth).

penalty units, imprisonment for six months, or both. 

49. The Act requires all scrutineers to wear a badge identifying them as a scrutineer whilst in 
the polling booth. The badges are supplied by the AEC. 

50. A scrutineer who breaches these requirements, commits misconduct or fails to obey the 
lawful directions of the presiding officer, may be removed from the polling booth by a member 
of the Australian Federal Police (AFP), the state or territory police force, or another person 
authorised by the presiding officer.

Obligations of persons present when pre-poll vote cast s. 
200K 

51. A person who is present when an elector signs a pre-poll vote certificate for declaration 
voting or marks a ballot paper must not interfere with the elector in relation to the elector&#39;s 
vote, do anything that would enable the person to find out how the elector marked the ballot 
paper or make any communication to the elector in relation to the elector’s vote. 

52. The penalty for breaching this provision is subject to a penalty up to 10 penalty units. 

Possible repercussions for persons who commit offences 

53. If the AEC becomes aware that a person is breaching the provisions of the Act during 
polling, any or all of the following actions may be taken.  

Removal from the premises 

54. Section 348 provides that where a person commits misconduct in a polling booth, 
counting centre or early voting centre, the person in charge of the premises may direct that 
person to leave the premises or have the person removed from the premises. 

Injunctions 

55. Section 383 of the Act provides that the Federal Court may grant an injunction to (amongst 
other things) prohibit a person from engaging in conduct that constitutes a contravention of 
the law in relation to elections. 

56. The AEC and candidates in the election may make an application for an injunction to the 
Federal Court. If the AEC is informed or becomes aware that a person may have committed an 
offence, the AEC determines whether it is appropriate in the circumstances to apply for an 
injunction. The Federal Court is able to order injunctions at short notice on Election Day. 

57. If an injunction is granted against a person, failure to comply with the injunction order may 
constitute contempt of court, for which the Federal Court can order arrest and detention. 

Prosecutions 

58. When the AEC becomes aware of a person engaging in activity that may constitute a 
breach of an offence provision, the AEC may refer the matter to the AFP for investigation. The 
AFP may then refer the matter to the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions for 
consideration, in accordance with the Commonwealth Prosecution Policy, as to whether a 
prosecution is initiated. 

Court of Disputed Returns  

59. There is a risk that if a person has engaged in an &#39;illegal practice&#39; (which is defined in 
section 352 to be a contravention of the Act or Regulations) the election of a candidate could 
also be challenged in the Court of Disputed Returns (CDR). Section 362 gives the CDR the 
power to void an election on the grounds of an illegal practice where the Court is satisfied that 
the results of the election was likely to have been affected as a result of the practice (see 
Mitchell v Bailey (No.2) [2008] FCA 692 and Scott-Irving v Oakeshott [2009] FCA 487).

2       POLICY PREMATURELY OPENED BALLOT BOX


--- Page 3 ---

Purpose of policy 

The purpose of this policy is to ensure that instances where a ballot box is opened 
prematurely are managed, reported, and conducted in accordance with the provisions of the 
Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 (Electoral Act) and in the case of a referendum, the 
Referendum (Machinery Provisions) Act 1984 (Referendum Act). 

This policy is not applicable for overseas pre-poll voting centres – all overseas voting is covered in relevant 
procedural documents established specifically for overseas voting services.  

1.  Legislative background 

1.1  Section 238B of the Electoral Act and s 41AB of the Referendum Act outline the process that the AEC 

and its officers are to undertake when a ballot box is opened prematurely. 

2.  Prematurely opened ballot box 

2.1  A prematurely opened ballot box includes any ballot box: 

• 

containing either ordinary ballot papers or declaration vote envelopes, that has been opened before 
the relevant legislated time frame1 

•  discovered to have been opened before the legislated time frame 2  

•  where the seal numbers do not match the numbers recorded on the Record of security seals form, 

and the discrepancy cannot be explained. 

2.2 

It excludes ballot boxes where a seal was not affixed correctly in the first place and/or the seal has been 
accidentally damaged and requires replacement. These types of instances are to be dealt with as part of 
normal operations. 

2.3  The legislated time frame for opening ballot boxes is as follows:

3.  Investigation process 

3.1  The premature opening of a ballot box (including declaration vote ballot boxes) or the discovery of a 

prematurely opened ballot box triggers the requirement to undertake: 

•  an investigation into and recording of the details of the premature opening of the ballot box 

•  an examination of the ballot papers or declaration vote envelopes in the prematurely opened ballot 

box to enable the Australian Electoral Officer (AEO) for the state or territory concerned to determine 
if they are to be included or excluded from scrutiny. 

3.2  The identification of prematurely opened ballot boxes and actions to be taken are the same for federal 

elections and referendums, or where the two events are held concurrently.  

3.3  The Prematurely Opened Ballot Box SOP details the correct process to undertake an investigation and 
the subsequent actions. These procedures must be followed where an officer suspects there is a 
prematurely opened ballot box.  

4.  Scenario guide 

4.1  Certain scenarios may be breaches of the Ballot Paper Handling Policy, but are not considered a 
prematurely opened ballot box. These should be dealt with as part of normal operations. 

4.2  The following scenario guide provides further information on the definition of what constitutes an ‘opened’ 

ballot box. Specific action to be taken can be found in the Prematurely Opened Ballot Box SOP.

--- Page 3 ---

1.  Overview 

1.1  Section 238B of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 (the Electoral Act) and s 41AB of the Referendum 
(Machinery Provisions) Act 1984 (the Referendum Act) prescribe procedures that polling officials, 
Divisional Returning Officers (DROs) and Australian Electoral Officers (AEOs) must follow if a ballot box 
containing ballot papers has been opened prematurely 

1.2  The premature opening of a ballot box, or the discovery of a prematurely opened ballot box, triggers the 

requirement to undertake: 

• 

• 

an investigation of the events leading up to the prematurely opening of the ballot box 

an examination of the ballot papers and declaration vote envelopes in the prematurely opened ballot 
box to enable the AEO for the state or territory concerned to determine if they are to be included or 
excluded from scrutiny. 

1.3  Further information, including what is and what isn’t considered a prematurely opened ballot box, is 

located in the Prematurely Opened Ballot Box Policy. 

2.  Role of polling staff  

2.1  Polling staff who become aware that a ballot box containing ballot papers has been opened prematurely 

must immediately report this to the Officer-in-Charge (OIC) or Team Leader. 

2.2  Once notified of the prematurely opened ballot box, according to the instructions in the Election 

Procedures Handbook, the OIC or Team Leader must: 

• 

• 

• 

take the ballot box and any loose ballot papers to the ballot paper secure zone 

secure the opened ballot box 

count the ballot papers and/or declaration envelopes that were contained in the ballot box and place 
these in a parcel 

• 

seal the parcel and affix with Label 33 – For AEO Investigation 

•  write on the label an indication of the type of ballot papers enclosed and that the ballot box has been 

prematurely opened 

• 

sign the label. 

2.3  The OIC/Team Leader must alert the Polling Place Liaison Officer (PPLO) / Early Voting Liaison Officer 

(EVLO) or DRO immediately about the incident. 

2.4  The OIC/Team Leader must ensure that the parcel containing ballot papers is sealed with tamper evident 

tape.  

2.5  The OIC/Team Leader must prepare a report using the Prematurely opened ballot box report (EF285) 

found in the return or materials catalogue, about the circumstances in which the ballot box was opened 
prematurely, including details of any witnesses. 

2.6  This report must be provided to the DRO along with the parcel, ballot box and any other thing the 

OIC/Team Leader considers appropriate as soon as practicable. A Ballot Paper Transfer Record (EF405) 
must be completed. 

2.7  Transport of the ballot papers must comply with transport requirements as per the Ballot Paper Handling 

Policy. 

3       SOP PREMATURELY OPENED BALLOT BOX


--- Page 4 ---

3.  Role of Divisional Returning Officer  

3.1  The DRO for the division must examine the report, parcel, ballot box and any other thing provided by the 
OIC/Team Leader and provide all materials to the AEO for their state or territory. DROs must ensure that 
they record the event and details of their observations and the report in the election diary. 

3.2  The DRO must ensure that an appropriate ballot paper secure zone is established to undertake this 
examination. They must also ensure that when transporting ballot papers to the AEO, transport 
requirements as per the Ballot Paper Handling Policy are complied with. The Ballot paper transfer record 
(EF405) must be completed at the time the transfer of custody of ballot paper takes place and retained on 
file in the election diary. 

4.  Role of Australian Electoral Officer  

4.1  The AEO must open the parcel and examine the ballot papers not enclosed in declaration envelopes, the 
declaration envelopes, the ballot box, the report and anything provided by the OIC via the DRO, and 
decide whether ballot papers are to be included in the scrutiny and whether declaration envelopes are to 
be included in preliminary scrutiny. 

4.2  The AEO must decide that a ballot paper is to be included into the scrutiny unless the AEO is satisfied 

that the ballot paper has been fraudulently altered or otherwise interfered with so as not to reflect the 
voter’s intention. 

4.3  The AEO must decide that an envelope is to be included in preliminary scrutiny unless the AEO is 

satisfied that the envelope has been fraudulently altered. 

4.4  After examining all the ballot papers and envelopes, the AEO must place in separate parcels: 

• 

• 

• 

• 

all ballot papers that are to be included in the scrutiny 

all ballot papers that are to be excluded from the scrutiny 

all declaration envelopes that are to be included in preliminary scrutiny 

all declaration envelopes that are to be excluded from preliminary scrutiny. 

4.5  The AEO must then seal each parcel with tamper evident tape, and complete and affix Label 36 – AEO 

Decision. 

4.6  The AEO must then return the parcels containing ballot papers and declaration envelopes to the DRO for 
the relevant division for inclusion or exclusion from either the scrutiny or preliminary scrutiny as the case 
requires. The AEO must ensure that an EF405 is completed for each parcel at the time the transfer of 
custody takes place. This form must be retained on file. 

4.7  Section 238B(14) of the Electoral Act requires that the AEO is responsible for the safe custody of the 

ballot papers and declaration envelopes they have determined to be excluded from the scrutiny. The AEO 
may decide to return these parcels to the DRO for storage pending statutorily authorised destruction; 
however they should be aware they ultimately remain responsible for these documents. 

4.8  Before the declaration of the poll in the election, the AEO must advise the Electoral Commissioner by 

formal minute, and the candidates concerned by letter, of the following: 

• 

• 

• 

that a ballot box was opened before the close of poll other than in accordance with the Act 

the number of ballot papers the AEO examined 

the number of ballot papers that were excluded from the scrutiny because the AEO was satisfied that 
they had been fraudulently altered or otherwise interfered with so as not to reflect the voter’s 
intention 

• 

the number of declaration envelopes the AEO examined 

4       SOP PREMATURELY OPENED BALLOT BOX


--- Page 5 ---

• 

the number of envelopes that were excluded from the preliminary scrutiny because the AEO was 
satisfied that they had been fraudulently altered. 

4.9  The AEO is responsible for the safe custody of the report and any other thing given to the AEO by the 

DRO in relation to this matter until they are destroyed. 

5.  Dealing with the ballot papers 

5.1  Ballot papers to be included in the count are to then undergo the applicable scrutiny under the control of 
the DRO. Ballot papers to be excluded from the scrutiny should be re-counted and these figures must be 
reconciled with the number provided in the OIC return. 

5.2  Ordinary ballot papers to be excluded from the count are to be recorded as ‘Discarded BPs’ in ELMS 

screen RHVO. 

5.3  Declaration votes to be included in the count are then to either go through the declaration vote exchange 

process or through the preliminary scrutiny process, as the case may be. 

5.4  Declaration votes that have been rejected by the AEO should be processed through the RMANS 

Declaration Scrutiny sub-system and rejected with the reason code DV (Discarded Declaration Votes). 
DROs should recheck these rejected declaration votes as per the usual process for rejected declaration 
votes. 

5.5  Once scrutiny has been completed, all ballot papers that have been affected by this process are to be 
parcelled separately and stored with other ballot papers from the division in accordance with the Ballot 
Paper Handling Scenario Guide.

Page 2\n\n\n--- Page 4 ---\n\nMessage from the Electoral Commissioner \nCongratulations on being selected to be a part of our election workforce. \n\nAustralia\u2019s electoral system is considered to be one of the fairest and most open of any in the \nworld and elections are a fundamental part of our democratic process.  \n\nAs part of the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) team, your role in this election will be \nsignificant. \n\nTo maintain the confidence of Australian voters, the AEC is focused on ensuring we deliver \ntrusted, consistently reliable, high quality, high integrity elections.  \n\nThis may be your first election, or you may be a veteran of many elections.  \n\nRegardless of your level of experience, it is important you study this handbook carefully. From \nelection to election procedures change. It is critical to our success that all the procedures \ndetailed in this handbook are strictly followed at your polling place. There are no exceptions to \nthis; should you not strictly follow the relevant procedures, it may put the election result at risk.  \n\nThe AEC has introduced a range of safety measures for voters, staff and other participants for \nthe  election  due  to  the  COVID-19  pandemic.  This  includes  physical  distancing  and  hygiene \nmeasures that conform with federal and local health advice and are also within the legislative \nframework  of  the Commonwealth  Electoral  Act  1918.  Your  role  will  include  specific  tasks  to \nensure these measures are implemented in polling venues. The safety of our staff, voters and \nall participants in the election remains the utmost priority for the AEC. \n\nAll staff in the AEC have adopted the mantra \u2018every task matters\u2019 which applies to every single \ntask \u2013 no matter what it is. I encourage you to also adopt this mantra in the role you are \nundertaking this election. \n\nI wish you every success as you help the AEC \ndeliver another election and in ensuring our \nelectoral processes are of the highest standard \nfor all Australians.  \n\nTom Rogers \nElectoral Commissioner \n\nElection Procedures Handbook \u2013 PPLO/OIC/2IC     Page 3\n\n\n--- Page 5 ---\n\nElection delivery principles \nAs a polling official, you play an important role in supporting the AEC perform its role in helping \neligible Australians to vote. There are a number of processes that occur in order to deliver an \nelection. Every task you do \u2013 no matter how small \u2013 matters. Even a minor error can have \nsignificant consequences. The election delivery principles summarise the key priorities for your \nrole as a polling official. \n\nThe \u2018election delivery principles\u2019 are: \n\n1.  Integrity of the result, which means: \n\na.  Safe custody and handling of ballot papers  \nb.  Maintaining integrity of a person\u2019s right to vote (prevention of voter \n\ndisenfranchisement) \nc.  Ballot paper formality \n2.  Efficient processes and procedures \n3.  Good customer service and positive customer experience.  \n\nIt is important to remember that all three principles are fundamentally important to your role \nbut there are priorities. For example, while good customer service is very important, it should \nnever come at the expense of electoral integrity, so although it may be distressing for a voter if \nthey have dropped something personal into the ballot box, you must never open the ballot box \nto retrieve it as the integrity of the result is first priority. \n\nWatch the videos \n\nA series of videos which demonstrate the procedures outlined in \nthis handbook is available on the AEC website. \n\nwww.aec.gov.au/election-training-videos \n\nElection Procedures Handbook \u2013 PPLO/OIC/2IC     Page 4\n\n\n--- Page 6 ---\n\nCOVID-19 safety measures for the election \nThe AEC is committed to delivering the election to ensure the integrity of electoral services and \nparticipation, and to support the welfare of voters, staff and other participants during the \nCOVID-19 pandemic environment. \n\nThe election will be held in accordance with electoral legislation, however additional measures \nare in place for this election that implement federal and state health advice and physical \ndistancing requirements. The infection-control advice the AEC is following has been provided \nby relevant federal, state and territory health authorities. Polling staff will play an important \nrole in the implementation of the COVID-19 safety measures. \n\nThe following key principles are to be followed in the polling place. You will be provided with \nparameters specific to your polling place, including the total square metres and maximum \nnumber of people allowed inside at one time. \n\n\u25aa  1.5 metre distancing wherever possible. \n\u25aa  Capacity limits as required by health guidance. \n\u25aa  Regular touchpoint cleaning to take place throughout the day. \n\u25aa  Sanitisation of hands for staff, voters and anyone entering and leaving the \n\npolling place, and between interactions. \n\n\u25aa  Availability of personal protective equipment for staff who choose to use it. \n\u25aa  Requirement for all staff working at a polling place to be fully vaccinated or \n\nhave an approved medical exemption. \n\nIt is not the role of polling place staff to ensure that voters entering the polling place comply \nwith COVID-19 safety measures. Polling place staff should encourage and support voters to \nadhere to measures for the health and safety of the community, but it is not our role to enforce \nthem and we cannot be seen to be denying the franchise of any Australian citizen who is \neligible to vote.  \n\nProcedures in this handbook that specifically relate to COVID-19 measures are marked by an \nalert icon like this: \n\nThe officer-in-charge (OIC) basic timetable \nIf for any reason you cannot work on polling day or are not able to stay for the duration of the \nday please advise the divisional office immediately. \n\nBefore polling day \n\nAs soon as possible: Review and complete the activities in the OIC Preparation Guide. \n\nAs soon as possible: Complete your polling official training. \n\nAs soon as possible: Inspect and finalise access arrangements with the polling place. \n\nAs soon as possible: Check the materials inventory. \n\nElection Procedures Handbook \u2013 PPLO/OIC/2IC      Page 5\n\n\n--- Page 7 ---\n\nPolling day eve \n\nWith assistance from the Second in Charge (2IC) \u2013 or another staff member if there is not a \n2IC for the polling place \u2013 set up the polling place. You will also need to telephone each polling \nofficial working at your polling place to confirm their start time for polling day. \n\nPolling day prior to 8am \n\nBy 7am: OIC arrives to commence pre-opening set up and complete the Safety Inspection \nChecklist. All other staff arrive and are ready to start their pre-opening preparations. \n\nBrief staff and scrutineers. \n\nPolling day after 8am  \n\n\u25aa  At exactly 8am, open the polling place. \n\u25aa  People are voting. \n\u25aa  OIC monitors staff and materials. \n\nPrior to 6pm: prepare for closing of polling place and post 6pm activities. \n\nPolling day after 6pm \n\nAt exactly 6pm, close the polling place  \n\n\u25aa  Brief scrutiny staff and scrutineers. \n\u25aa  Declaration vote issuing officers complete ballot paper and declaration vote envelope \n\nreconciliation.  \n\n\u25aa  Staff prepare for and conduct scrutiny. \n\u25aa  Results are phoned in to the Election Night Results Team. \n\nAfter scrutiny, materials are packed, OIC finalises the OIC return (EF027) and final duties are \nperformed. \n\nStaff can leave once directed by the OIC. The OIC follows the materials return plan advised by \nthe divisional office, which may include transferring custody to a Scrutiny Assistant (Return of \nMaterials (RoM)). \n\nNOTE: The exact finish time for each polling place is not known, and can be quite late in the \nevening.  \n\nElection Procedures Handbook \u2013 PPLO/OIC/2IC     Page 6\n\n\n--- Page 8 ---\n\nPolling official roles \n\nIntroduction \nPolling officials are accountable to the OIC of a polling place. \n\nThe OIC is responsible to the polling place liaison officer (PPLO) and, ultimately, the divisional \nreturning officer (DRO) of an electoral division. \n\nThe DRO is an employee of the AEC and is responsible for the electoral roll and conduct of \nelectoral events for an electoral division. \n\nIf your polling place is issuing votes for more than one Division (known as a dual or multi \npolling place), each division will operate as a separate polling place sharing the premises - with \nits own OIC and polling place staff accountable to their respective PPLO and DRO. \n\nPolling place liaison officer (PPLO) \nPPLOs act as agents for the DRO on polling day. They visit a group of polling places to observe \nand advise on proceedings and report back to the DRO. \n\nThe PPLO is there to provide assistance to the OIC and ensure that polling and the scrutiny \n(counting of the ballot papers) is carried out according to the correct procedures. \n\nIt is critical that the PPLO understands all functions of the OIC\u2019s role as they are expected to \nassist the OIC to rectify any issues or incorrect processes they witness in the polling place. \n\nIf a PPLO is aware of any issues or has any concerns in the lead up to polling day they should \ndiscuss them immediately with the divisional office.  \n\nPPLO duties \n\nPrior to polling day \n\nBefore polling day, the PPLO should: \n\n\u25aa  complete online and face-to-face PPLO election training and familiarise themselves \n\nwith the election procedures handbook  \n\n\u25aa  attend an election readiness briefing (the divisional office will advise PPLOs of \n\nsession details). This will include a discussion with the DRO about the schedule of \npolling places for the day, and the likely level of assistance each OIC will need \n\u25aa  check count all materials allocated and record the details in the PPLO Return. This \nincludes counting individual Senate and the House of Representatives ballot \npapers. Note that if House of Representatives ballot papers (only) are supplied \nshrink-wrapped or padded with numbered butts, it can be assumed that each \npack/pad contains the number of ballot papers advised on the packing slip, so only \n\nElection Procedures Handbook \u2013 PPLO/OIC/2IC      Page 7\n\n\n--- Page 9 ---\n\nthe number of bundles need to be check counted \n\n\u25aa  contact each OIC to introduce themselves and offer any assistance the OIC may \n\nneed \n\n\u25aa  ensure each OIC understands the correct procedures for securing ballot papers in \n\ntheir home, vehicle and polling place \n\n\u25aa \n\nreview the information supplied in the PPLO Return to ensure they are aware of; \n\n\u2022  vote estimates for each polling place, \n\n\u2022 \n\nthe number of staff required at each polling place, \n\n\u2022  PPLO instructions for polling day and night. \n\n\u25aa  assist with the set-up of polling place(s) on Friday evening, where required \n\u25aa  ensure their mobile telephone is charged. \n\nPolling day \n\nThe DRO will make PPLOs aware of any local factors, expected problems and last minute \nchanges. \n\nThe DRO will advise the PPLO on a polling day schedule. This may be subject to change based \non support needs of OICs and broader circumstances.  \n\nThe PPLO should keep in regular telephone contact with the DRO and OICs throughout the day \nand evening until all allocated polling places have returned their results and their materials to \nthe out-posted centre/hub.   \n\nVisiting polling places \n\nPPLOs are expected to visit each polling place twice throughout polling day and at least one \npolling place from 5:50pm to support the closing of the polling place, scrutiny and pack-up. \n\nThe PPLO Return includes a report that must be completed each time the PPLO visits a polling \nplace. This helps the AEC fulfil their responsibilities to assess the performance of each polling \nplace and OIC and address any future requirements.  \n\nPPLOs should ensure they follow COVID-safe procedures during each visit, including QR code \ncheck-in using the relevant state/territory\u2019s mobile phone app, using hand sanitiser on entry \nand exit, maintaining physical distance and respecting any capacity limits.  \n\nOn polling day the PPLO should: \n\nintroduce themselves to the OIC on entering the polling place, \n\n\u25aa \n\u25aa  examine the OIC return and ensure that instructions are being accurately followed \n\nand the return is being progressively completed, \n\n\u25aa  ensure the OIC has set-up and signposted a polling place ballot paper secure zone \n(secure zone) and that the ballot paper transport containers are being stored \ninside the secure zone, \n\n\u25aa  ensure the layout allows for a single direction of movement through the polling \n\nplace so that voters flow through easily with minimal crossover, \n\n\u25aa  make sure mini-queues are being used where applicable, \n\u25aa \n\nif necessary, suggest to the OIC possible improvements to the polling place layout \n\nElection Procedures Handbook \u2013 PPLO/OIC/2IC     Page 8\n\n\n--- Page 10 ---\n\nto ensure the smooth flow of voters, \n\n\u25aa  ensure the OIC has a plan in place for staff meal breaks, \n\u25aa  ensure the OIC has a plan for the scrutiny or assist in planning if required, \n\n\u25aa \n\n\u25aa \n\n\u25aa \n\n\u25aa \n\n\u25aa \n\n\u25aa \n\n\u25aa \n\u25aa \n\u25aa \n\n\u25aa \n\n\u25aa \n\n\u25aa \n\nduring the day gauge the capacity of the OICs in each polling place and ensure they \nare available where most needed at close of poll to help organise the scrutiny, \ndiscuss this with the DRO, as they will know each OIC\u2019s previous experience, \nensure that work health and safety, including COVID-safe, procedures are being \nimplemented and followed by all staff, \nensure that ordinary vote issuing officers are following correct procedures - \nspecifically that they are asking the 3 questions, marking the certified list and \nissuing ballot papers correctly, \nensure that declaration vote issuing officers are following the correct procedure \nwhen using the division finder and issuing declaration votes, \nensure that all issuing officers are telling every voter how to fill in their ballot papers \ncorrectly, initialling each ballot paper, and telling voters what to do if they make a \nmistake, \nensure that ballot papers held on issuing tables are under close supervision by the \nissuing officer or another AEC officer at all times and, if necessary, are securely \nstored by the OIC when an issuing point isn\u2019t being used, \nensure that all ballot boxes are being closely guarded throughout polling, \nensure that the OIC is aware of the role and responsibilities of scrutineers, \ndiscuss plans with the OIC for the packaging of ballot papers and election materials \nfor handover to the scrutiny assistant (RoM) to return to the location advised by the \ndivisional office, \nsupply additional materials to polling places and/or liaise with the out-posted centre \nstaff, as required, \nsupervise and support the set-up and conduct of the House of Representatives \nscrutiny, Senate count and packaging of materials as required, \nprovide a written assessment of the OIC\u2019s performance during the day. This is done \nin the Polling place visits \u2013 checklist of the PPLO Return. \n\nOn return of results from all allocated polling places, or when instructed to do so, the PPLO \nshould pack their materials and return to the out-posted centre. \n\nManaging issues \n\nPPLOs will deal with a wide range of personalities and temperaments and as such must use \ngood communication and interpersonal skills to ensure that each polling place is being \nmanaged efficiently and consistently.  \n\nIf a staff member or OIC needs support in adhering to a particular process, the PPLO should \napproach the situation in a positive and encouraging way. Ensure that the staff member \nconcerned is advised on the correct process.  \n\nAt the same time, it is important that the PPLO reports accurately on the management and \nperformance of the polling place. \n\nElection Procedures Handbook \u2013 PPLO/OIC/2IC      Page 9\n\n\n--- Page 11 ---\n\nPPLO Return \n\nThe PPLO Return is a set of forms that outline the general duties before and during polling. It is \nalso used to track the materials received from the divisional office and those given to polling \nplaces throughout polling day, and includes checklists to complete during each polling place \nvisit. \n\nList of polling places to visit \n\nThe PPLO should contact each OIC on the list prior to polling day to ensure the OIC is prepared \nand to give them the opportunity to ask any questions.  \n\nCheck count of materials to be carried \n\nThe divisional office will provide each PPLO with a materials inventory. The inventory is to be \nused to ensure the PPLO has received the correct quantity of materials. The PPLO should \nupdate their inventory list with any corrections, and contact the divisional office if they are \nmissing materials or if the materials have been damaged in any way. \n\nTransporting ballot papers \n\nPPLOs may be required to carry an allocation of spare ballot papers.  \n\nWhen transporting ballot papers they must be inside a sealed ballot paper transport container \nwith a completed Record of security seals form placed in the plastic window on the container \nand stored out of sight in a fully enclosed, locked vehicle.   \n\nBallot papers that are stored in the PPLO\u2019s home/accommodation overnight (prior to polling \nday) must be kept in a secure zone. This must be a secure area in your home that is out of \npublic view and unlikely to be accessed by others.  \n\nDistribution of election materials \n\nEach time the PPLO issues ballot papers to a polling place, they must take the sealed transport \ncontainer into the polling place and open it in the presence of the OIC. The number of ballot \npapers transferred to the OIC should be counted by the PPLO on allocation, check counted by \nthe OIC on receipt, and the following information recorded: \n\n\u25aa  Ballot papers: Complete the Cover note for the supply/receipt of ballot papers \n\nform. The PPLO retains the original copy and the OIC keeps the duplicate with their \nReturn.  \n\n\u25aa  Declaration envelopes: Record the polling place, time and number of additional \n\ndeclaration vote envelopes allocated in the PPLO Return. \n\nThe transport container must then be re-sealed and the Record of security seals form \ncompleted and then witnessed by the OIC. \n\nUse hand sanitiser before and after handling materials. \n\nElection Procedures Handbook \u2013 PPLO/OIC/2IC     Page 10\n\n\n--- Page 12 ---\n\nPPLO Polling place checklist  \n\nThe Polling place checklist is a multi-page report \nthat must be completed for every visit to every \npolling place. OICs must countersign the report for \ntheir polling place each time you visit. \n\nThe PPLO should ensure they provide as much \ninformation as possible to assist the divisional \noffice with future planning. It will also assist in \nproviding an accurate rating on the performance of \nthe OICs at the end of the day. \n\nOfficer-in-charge (OIC) and second-in-charge \n(2IC) \n\nOIC duties \n\nAs the OIC, your primary function is to \nmanage the polling place. \n\nYou are responsible for the conduct of \npolling at your polling place.  \n\nYou have responsibility for and authority \nover all aspects of polling operations in your \npolling place.  \n\nKey responsibilities of this position include:  \n\n\u25aa  overall management of the polling place \n\u25aa  ensuring security of materials (ballot papers, certified lists)  \n\u25aa  promoting safety and wellbeing of staff and electors \n\u25aa  completing and certifying the OIC return  \n\u25aa  staff assessments  \n\u25aa \n\ntimely and accurate return of results.  \n\nYou should exercise your authority and carry out your responsibilities in a professional and \npolitically neutral manner at all times.  \n\nYou are responsible for ensuring that polling is conducted in accordance with this Election \nProcedures Handbook (which reflects the requirements of the Commonwealth Electoral Act \n1918) and any instructions from the divisional office.  \n\nElection Procedures Handbook \u2013 PPLO/OIC/2IC     Page 11\n\n\n--- Page 13 ---\n\nOIC Preparation Guide \n\nThe OIC Preparation Guide is a set of documents that will assist you prior to polling day.  \n\nIt includes forms that need completing and checklists to follow to assist you in the planning \nand set up of the polling place.  \n\nOIC Return \n\nThe OIC return consists of checklists that will walk you through the activities of polling day and \nforms that you will use to create your polling place records.

This also \ninvolves: \n\n\u25aa \n\nrecording the total number of ballot papers \nallocated by the OIC on the Certified list \ncoversheet \n\n\u25aa  keeping ballot papers and the certified list \n\nsecure  \n\n\u25aa  encouraging voters to update their \n\nenrolment if required  \n\n\u25aa  completing and signing all required forms and paperwork, especially the certified \n\nlist coversheet \n\n\u25aa  directing silent electors to the OIC or 2IC to cast a declaration vote, and \n\u25aa  sanitising hands after every ten voters, contact with another person, coughing, \n\nsneezing or touching their face. \n\nBallot box guard \n\nThere MUST be a ballot box guard on duty at all times between 8am and 6pm. \n\nThe primary function of the ballot box guard is to monitor the ballot boxes for ordinary votes. \nThis involves: \n\n\u25aa  stand in close proximity to the ballot box (maintaining appropriate physical \n\ndistancing from voters), \n\n\u25aa  ensuring ordinary voters place ballot papers in the correct ballot boxes, particularly \nimportant for dual and multi polling places, and do not leave the polling place with \nballot papers, \n\n\u25aa  counting voter flow using the clicker provided, \n\u25aa  ensuring that nobody attempts to retrieve anything from rubbish bins , \n\u25aa  directing voters to use hand sanitiser when exiting the polling place, and \n\u25aa  ensuring ballot boxes are not opened until after 6pm on polling day. \n\nElection Procedures Handbook \u2013 PPLO/OIC/2IC     Page 15\n\n\n--- Page 17 ---\n\nQueue controller \n\nQueue controllers are based beside the queuing sign and are responsible for managing the \nqueue and flow of voters. This involves: \n\n\u25aa  organising voters at entry of polling place to ensure capacity limits and physical \n\ndistancing requirements are observed, \n\n\u25aa  encouraging voters to sanitise their hands on entry, and collect a pencil for \n\ncompleting their ballot papers, \n\n\u25aa  directing voters to mini-queues of one voter in front of each issuing point. Mini-\n\nqueues are a very effective way to increase the throughput of voters and decrease \nwait times, \n\n\u25aa  ensuring that voters from other divisions are directed to the declaration vote \n\nissuing point, \n\n\u25aa  ensuring sufficient supplies of sanitised pencils are available for voters at entry, \n\u25aa  every hour, on the hour, recording the total number of voters waiting in the queues \n\n(including mini queues), \n\n\u25aa  assisting voters to check in to the polling place using the QR code or manual \n\nregistration system, as required, and \n\n\u25aa  escorting elderly and frail voters to the head of the queue and identifying other \n\nvoters who require assistance and assisting them, or referring them to the inquiry \nofficer, or OIC. \n\nIn larger or busier venues, a second queue controller can be used to assist in the above duties. \n\nHygiene Officer \nThe primary functions of hygiene officers are: \n\n\u25aa  spraying and wiping plastic voting screen inserts after every 10th voter (or every 15 \n\nminutes if there is a constant voter flow), \n\n\u25aa  spraying and wiping the voter side of ordinary issuing tables after every 10th voter \n\n(or every 15 minutes if there is a constant voter flow), \n\n\u25aa  spraying and wiping the declaration issuing table after every 10th voter (or every \n\n15 minutes if there is a constant voter flow), \nremoving any material left behind in voting screens between voters, \n\n\u25aa \n\u25aa  ensuring there is adequate hand sanitiser at the entrance, exit, and issuing tables \n\n(shared between staff), \n\n\u25aa  sanitise pencils used by voters between uses, and return pencils to entry for queue \ncontroller distribution; and cleaning used pens at the declaration vote issuing \ntable, and \n\n\u25aa  maintaining the polling place in a clean and safe condition. \n\nDeclaration vote issuing officers and inquiry officers \n\nThroughout the day you should rotate staff between these roles and ensure they are following \ncorrect procedures.  \n\nThese staff also assist with the count of ordinary ballot papers. Inquiry officers can assist with \nthe count straight away, but declaration vote issuing officers can only assist after completing \nthe checking, balancing, paperwork and packaging of all declaration vote materials. \n\nElection Procedures Handbook \u2013 PPLO/OIC/2IC     Page 16\n\n\n--- Page 18 ---\n\nDeclaration vote issuing officer  \n\nVoters who do not reside in divisions issuing ordinary votes or whose names are not on the \ncertified list are directed to declaration vote issuing officers for the issue of absent and \nprovisional votes. Only the home division will issue declaration votes in a dual or multi polling \nplace see Issuing declaration votes on page 51. \n\nThe declaration vote issuing officer also: \n\n\u25aa  accounts for all ballot papers allocated and keeps them secure, \n\u25aa  uses the division finder to determine the voter\u2019s enrolled division, \n\u25aa  ensures voters\u2019 ballot papers are placed in the correct declaration envelope which \n\nis then placed in the correct ballot box, \n\u25aa  guards the declaration envelope ballot box, \n\u25aa \n\u25aa  sanitises hands after every ten voters, contact with another person, coughing, \n\nfiles counterfoils progressively, \n\nsneezing or touching their face, \n\n\u25aa  sanitises pens issued to voters after each use or alerting the hygiene officer to \n\nperform this task, \n\n\u25aa  completes the Ballot paper tracking form and Elector information reports, \n\u25aa  completes the After 6pm checklist for staff reconciling declaration votes, and \n\u25aa  sorts declaration vote envelopes and counterfoils and reconciles their ballot papers \n\nafter close of poll. \n\nInquiry officer  \n\nAn inquiry officer moves around the polling area to assist as necessary to: \n\n\u25aa  attend to the needs of voters waiting in the queue, \n\u25aa  make regular announcements to those in the queue \u201cremember to number every \n\nbox on your green ballot paper and number at least 6 boxes above the line or at \nleast 12 boxes below the line on the white ballot paper\u201d, \n\u25aa  answer voter inquiries, including how to cast a formal vote, \n\u25aa  use the division finder to assist voters in determining their enrolled division, \n\u25aa  assist voters who require help in casting a vote, \n\u25aa  assist voters to update their enrolment if required, and  \n\u25aa  complete Elector Information Reports. \n\nElection Procedures Handbook \u2013 PPLO/OIC/2IC     Page 17\n\n\n--- Page 19 ---\n\nPart-day staff \n\nPart-day staff are employed for shifts of 5 or 8 hours on polling day.  \n\nDiscuss starting times with these staff before polling day. They must not work for more hours \nthan they have been employed to work. \n\nThey perform the same role as issuing officers and are helpful to rotate in to help cover staff \nbreaks and can be asked to perform most tasks except declaration vote issuing and OIC/2IC \ntasks. You will need to provide on the job training for issuing ordinary votes or working during \nthe scrutiny. \n\nEnsure you sight their proof of COVID-19 vaccination status or medical exemption evidence  at \nthe commencement of their shift. \n\nScrutiny assistant \n\nScrutiny assistants are employed on polling night from 5pm until 11pm. Where a scrutiny \nassistant has been assigned the task of returning materials they may continue working after \n11pm.   \n\nUpon arrival at the polling place, scrutiny assistants must report to you and sign an attendance \nrecord. Ensure you sight their proof of COVID-19 vaccination status or medical exemption \nevidence at the commencement of their shift. \n\nThey may then be asked to: \n\nremove materials from voting screens, \n\u25aa \n\u25aa  progressively dismantle cardboard voting \nscreens and stack them in a storage area, \n\u25aa  assist with preparation for scrutinies, including \npre-filling sort cards, labels and setting up \ntables if they do not interfere with the \noperation of the polling place, and \nreplace queue controllers and ballot box \nguards while they have a break. \n\n\u25aa \n\nFrom 6pm, scrutiny assistants may be required to: \n\nremove signs and posters from the walls, \n\n\u25aa  assist with the scrutiny of House of Representatives ballot papers and count of \nSenate ballot papers, including unfolding, sorting and counting ballot papers, \n\u25aa  dismantle the remaining cardboard material and prepare cardboard for collection, \n\u25aa  assist with the packaging of material for return to the out-posted centre, \n\u25aa \n\u25aa \n\u25aa \n\u25aa  perform any other official tasks as directed by yourself or the 2IC, and \n\u25aa \n\ntidy the polling place, \ninspect the polling place to ensure that no material has been overlooked, \n\ntake custody of material once the polling place is packed up and return it to the \nidentified location. \n\nElection Procedures Handbook \u2013 PPLO/OIC/2IC     Page 18\n\n\n--- Page 20 ---\n\nPreparation for polling \n\nInspecting the polling place \n\nPrior to polling day \n\nFamiliarisation with the polling place is an important part of your preparation. \n\nContact details for the person who holds the keys at your nominated premises are in your OIC \nreturn. It is essential that you inspect the polling place as soon as possible. Do not leave this \ntask until the last minute. The night before polling day is too late. The DRO will also advise OICs \nif they are working in a dual or multi polling place, if they are the host or guest, and provide \ncontact details for co-located OICs. The OIC of the host division is responsible for coordinating \npremises access and set-up with their co-located OICs.  \n\nDuring the inspection use the OIC preparation guide which contains a summary of the tasks to \ncomplete when conducting the inspection. If the venue cannot be inspected, contact the \ndivisional office. \n\nOn polling day \n\nPrior to the start of polling the Safety inspection checklist in the OIC return must be completed. \nThe OIC can ask any staff member to complete it. \n\nPolling place equipment \n\nReceipt of cardboard and other voting equipment \n\nThe divisional office will advise you of the arrangements to supply equipment to the polling \nplace. Usually, this equipment will be delivered directly to the polling \nplace within the two weeks leading up to polling day.  \n\nYou will receive cardboard equipment such as voting screens, ballot \npaper secure zone screens, ballot boxes, issue point storage boxes \nand a bin. \n\nDepending on the size of the polling place you may also receive \nqueuing equipment, issuing point signs, or cardboard tables.  \n\nYou should check that your whole allocation \u2013 including that for \ndual/multi polling - has been delivered before polling day. If you have been short-supplied or \nthe equipment is damaged, advise the divisional office immediately. \n\nConstruction of cardboard equipment \n\n1.  All instructions for how to construct the cardboard polling equipment are printed on the \n\nactual equipment, and QR codes linking to video instructions are also provided  \n\nIf you have any difficulty constructing any equipment, or have any concerns about the quality of \nthe equipment, especially ballot boxes, transport containers or seals contact your divisional \noffice for assistance. \n\nElection Procedures Handbook \u2013 PPLO/OIC/2IC     Page 19\n\n\n--- Page 21 ---\n\nMaterials \nThe materials for the polling place will be provided at a time and location advised by the \ndivisional office. If a dual or multi polling place, each division's OIC will be supplied with \nrelevant materials, however all cardboard materials will be delivered direct to the premises. \n\nCheck that you have received the correct number of items against the election materials \ninventory provided in your OIC return and advise the divisional office of any shortages or if \nanything has been damaged. \n\nCertified lists \n\nA \u2018certified list\u2019 is the list of people who are eligible to vote in your division. You \nmust distribute one to every ordinary vote issuing point before polling commences. \nIt contains the name, address, gender and birth date of people enrolled to vote. \nEach ordinary voter\u2019s name is marked off the list when they are given their ballot \npapers. \n\nAfter the election the lists are scanned electronically to detect these marks. Polling \nofficial errors may result in people who voted getting apparent non-voter or multiple \nvoter notices so it is important to be as accurate as possible when marking voters \noff the certified list.  \n\nIf a spare certified list has been provided it can be used to open an additional temporary \nissuing point during peak periods. The cellophane seal of the spare certified list should not be \nbroken unless it is needed. \n\nCertified list coversheet \n\nThe Certified list coversheet, located inside the front cover of each certified list, is one of the \ncritical forms to be completed at the polling place. Every ordinary vote issuing officer who uses \nthe certified list must sign it and update the details each time ballot papers are allocated to \nthem. \n\nThis form assists with the completion of the OIC return. The Certified list coversheet helps \naccurately balance the number of ballot papers issued to voters with the number of ballot \npapers counted in the scrutinies, and to reconcile the number of ballot papers allocated to the \npolling place. It must stay with the certified list; it is used during the scanning process. \n\nAny movement of certified lists between polling places must be approved by the DRO and \nnoted in the OIC return.  In the rare instance that a certified list has been reallocated from \nanother polling place, the reallocation field of the Certified List coversheet must be updated. \n\nDivision finder \n\nDivision finders are an alphabetical listing of all localities and some streets within a state or \nterritory and are used to determine a voter\u2019s enrolled division if they are casting a declaration \nvote. \n\nBefore issuing a declaration voter with ballot papers the issuing officer must always consult a \ndivision finder to determine their correct division and record the division finder reference on \nthe declaration vote envelope. \n\nFor instructions on using a division finder, read the division finder guide on page 100. \n\nElection Procedures Handbook \u2013 PPLO/OIC/2IC     Page 20\n\n\n--- Page 22 ---\n\nProvisional voting statement \n\nVoters casting a provisional vote must read the provisional voting statement on the back of the \ndeclaration vote envelope before voting. \n\nThe provisional voting statement explains the reasons for a provisional vote.  \n\nAfter reading the provisional voting statement, the voter may choose not to vote. If the \ndeclaration officer alerts the OIC of any such occurrences, this should be recorded on the \nReports on issues and miscellaneous matters form in the OIC return. \n\nIssuing point storage box \n\nEach issuing point will be provided with an issuing point storage box. If an issuing point is \nbeing closed while an issuing officer is on a scheduled break, ballot papers and, if applicable, \nthe certified list must be packed into the storage box and given to the OIC for storage in the \nsecure zone. \n\nHow to vote guide \n\nThe How to vote guide has information in a range of languages (including \nEnglish) to assist voters to cast a formal vote. \n\nThe guide must be made available to any voter who has trouble \nunderstanding how to fill in their ballot papers.  \n\nPolling places with a queue controller and/or inquiry officer should issue \nthese roles with a How to vote guide for use when assisting voters.  \n\nYour polling place may be given extra copies of individual pages if it is in an \narea known to have a high number of voters who may benefit from the \ninformation. These pages should be easily accessible to voters within the polling place. \n\nID badge \n\nAll polling officials must wear a role appropriate identification badge so that other polling \nofficials, scrutineers and members of the public can easily identify each official\u2019s role. \n\nBadges should be changed when polling officials rotate into different roles. Lanyards and \nbadges must not be shared for hygiene reasons. \n\nAEC vest \n\nEvery polling official in your polling place must wear an AEC vest - yellow \nvests for the OIC and 2IC and purple vests for the remaining polling staff. \n\nVests remain the property of the AEC at all times and must be removed \nduring breaks and returned at the completion of polling night. Vests must not \nbe shared for hygiene reasons. \n\nPackaging tape \n\nPackaging tape is used on bags that do not have an adhesive seal, where \nthe adhesive seal cannot be used (for instance the bag may be folded in a \nway that prevents the use of the seal) or if the adhesive seal isn\u2019t strong \nenough to hold the bag closed. Tamper evident tape is then placed over the \npackaging tape. \n\nElection Procedures Handbook \u2013 PPLO/OIC/2IC     Page 21\n\n\n--- Page 23 ---\n\nTamper evident tape \n\nTamper evident tape is used on parcels of ballot papers and some packages for transfer. The \ntape is perforated and tears at equal lengths without the need for scissors. \n\nTamper evident tape should not be used to seal parcels or packages. It should be stuck over \nthe final seal of the parcel or package to show it hasn\u2019t been tampered with. If someone \nattempts to remove this tape from a parcel it will leave an obvious residue as evidence of \ntampering.  \n\nNote: Tamper evident tape will also leave a residue on walls, windows and carpet etc., which is \nvery difficult to remove, so it should ONLY be used for parcelling and packaging purposes.  \n\nReserve stock of polling materials \n\nTo avoid running out of ballot papers or other material on polling day, you must check \nremaining supplies at regular intervals. Contact your PPLO if you suspect you will be short of \nany item. \n\nIf additional election forms, declaration vote envelopes or ballot papers are required but \ncannot be obtained from the PPLO or out-posted centre quickly enough to supply current \ndemand, forms may be photocopied or amended in order to continue providing voting services. \nSee the troubleshooting section on page 94 for more information. \n\nAdditional materials \n\nIn addition to normal materials, polling places will receive: \n\n\u25aa \n\u25aa \n\u25aa \n\u25aa \n\u25aa \n\u25aa \n\u25aa \n\u25aa \n\u25aa \n\u25aa \n\u25aa \n\u25aa \n\u25aa \n\u25aa \n\ncloth tape for floor markings \nvoter screen plastic inserts \nbottles of hand sanitiser \nsanitising spray \npaper towels \n\nsanitising wipes (as backup/alternative to the spray) \nface masks \ngloves \npencils for distribution  \n\nCOVID-19 safety measures signs \nvenue capacity sign \nCOVID-safe check-in signs \n\nextra bin liners, and \nextra bin for PPE disposal. \n\nElection Procedures Handbook \u2013 PPLO/OIC/2IC     Page 22\n\n\n--- Page 24 ---\n\nHygiene requirements \n\nThe following provisions will be in place for polling staff: \n\n\u25aa  QR codes for check in and manual sign-in sheets if unable to use QR code, \n\u25aa \n\u25aa  hand sanitiser to be used: \n\ncapacity limits indoors, and physical distancing, \n\n   when entering (or re-entering) the polling place \n   by issuing officers every ten voters \n\nimmediately after coming into physical contact with a voter or other staff \nmember \nimmediately after touching face, or \n\n   at any other time contamination could have occurred. \n\n\u25aa  masks will be available if staff want to wear them, \n\u25aa  masks should be replaced as soon as they become damp and should not be re-\n\nused, \n\n\u25aa  gloves will be required for hygiene officers, and available for other staff that want \n\nto wear them (for example if staff are concerned about the effect of sanitiser on \ntheir hands). If worn, hand sanitiser must still be applied to the outside of the \ngloves to the same regularity, and \n\n\u25aa  staff should wash their hands before, during and after breaks. \n\nThe following provisions will be in place for voters: \n\n\u25aa  QR codes for check-in and manual sign-in sheets if unable to use QR code, \n\u25aa  capacity limits indoors, and physical distancing \n\u25aa  hand sanitiser to be used on entry and exit (and as requested) \n\u25aa \n\u25aa  voters are welcome to wear their own masks and gloves but based on health \n\nregular touchpoint cleaning, and \n\nadvice, these will not be issued by the AEC. \n\nThe COVID-19 safety measures signs are to be placed around the polling place to remind \neveryone of the requirements. \n\nDistribution of materials \n\nEnsure issuing officers take time to familiarise themselves with the materials they will be using \nduring the day. \n\nThe following materials can be allocated to issuing points on polling eve: \n\nOrdinary issuing points \n\n\u25aa \n\u25aa \n\u25aa \n\u25aa \n\u25aa \n\nCertified list ruler. \nA black pen specifically for marking the certified list.  \n\nElector information report. \nSpoilt or discarded ballot paper envelopes. \nInstructional placecard. \n\nElection Procedures Handbook \u2013 PPLO/OIC/2IC     Page 23\n\n\n--- Page 25 ---\n\nIssuing point storage box. \n\u25aa \n\u25aa  QR codes for enrolment, and \n\u25aa  Hand sanitiser and sanitising wipes (shared). \n\nDeclaration vote issuing points \n\n\u25aa \n\nIssuing point storage box. \n\n\u25aa  Declaration vote envelopes.  \n\n\u25aa \n\nCounterfoil folder. \n\n\u25aa  Ballot paper tracking form. \n\n\u25aa \n\nAfter 6pm checklist for staff reconciling declaration votes. \n\n\u25aa  Division finder. \n\n\u25aa \n\n\u25aa \n\nInstructional placecard. \n\nSpoilt or discarded ballot paper envelopes. \n\n\u25aa  Declaration ballot paper holder to store House of Representatives ballot papers \n\nduring polling and dividers. \n\n\u25aa  QR codes for enrolment. \n\n\u25aa \n\n\u25aa \n\n\u25aa \n\nElector information reports. \n\nList of candidates booklet. \n\nA supply of pens for completion of declaration vote envelopes. \n\n\u25aa  Unsealed ballot box (each declaration issuing officer has their own ballot box), \n\nand \n\n\u25aa  Hand sanitiser and sanitising wipes (shared). \n\nBallot papers and certified lists are to be distributed on polling day. \n\nOIC Table \n\nInstructional placecard. \n\n\u25aa  OIC return. \n\u25aa \n\u25aa \n\u25aa \n\nList of candidates booklet, and \nList of polling places that can issue interstate votes. \n\nThe following items should be held in reserve at your table on polling day until needed: \n\n\u25aa  Reserve enrolment forms and reply paid envelopes. \n\u25aa  Reserve elector information reports. \n\u25aa  Reserve spoilt or discarded ballot paper envelopes, and \n\u25aa \n\nScrutineer badges. \n\nElection Procedures Handbook \u2013 PPLO/OIC/2IC     Page 24\n\n\n--- Page 26 ---\n\nBallot paper handling \n\nBallot paper principles \n\nThe AEC upholds the sanctity of the ballot paper in all its forms and at all times.   \n\nAs an AEC official, you have a responsibility to uphold the integrity of all ballot papers at all \ntimes in accordance with the following ballot paper principles:  \n\n1.  All ballot papers remain \u2018live\u2019 from printing through to statutorily authorised \n\ndestruction. \n\n2.  The security, integrity and accountability of ballot papers must be preserved at all \n\ntimes - including transit and storage by the AEC, contractors, or other third parties.  \n\nThese two maxims of ballot paper handling must never be breached and must underpin AEC \noperations, culture and standards.  \n\nCollecting ballot papers  \n\nBallot papers for each polling place will be packaged and sealed inside ballot paper transport \ncontainers with a Record of ballot paper transport container seals form.  \n\nIf you are collecting polling material directly from the AEC you will be required to show \nidentification at the time of collection: \n\n\u25aa  Drivers licence, \n\u25aa  Passport, or  \n\u25aa  Your Confirmation of Casual Employment form AND a Medicare or credit card. \n\nWhere ballot papers are being sent via courier you will be informed of the estimated time of \ndelivery. Once materials arrive you must sign the consignment form and send an email to the \ndivisional office to confirm the receipt of polling materials.  \n\nNote that each OIC in a dual or multi polling place will receive their own allocation of ballot \npapers and other materials from their respective divisional offices. Advise the divisional office \nif polling material does not arrive within the expected timeframe. \n\nIssuing ballot papers \n\nThe process for issuing ballot papers to electors are outlined below and on the placecards \nprovided for each ordinary and declaration vote issuing officer. It is extremely important that \nissuing officers follow the script, and give electors the correct advice about completing ballot \npapers. If an elector asks a question relating to casting their vote or how their votes are \ncounted and the issuing officer is unsure of the answer, the elector should be referred to the \nOIC or the AEC website.   \n\nBallot paper check count and reconciliation \n\nWhen you receive ballot papers you must check count your ballot paper stock following these \nsteps: \n\n\u25aa  Unseal the transport container in the presence of a witness. Please advise the \ndivisional office if you do not have anybody to act as witness so alternate \narrangements can be made. \n\nElection Procedures Handbook \u2013 PPLO/OIC/2IC     Page 25\n\n\n--- Page 27 ---\n\n\u25aa  Check count the individual Senate ballot papers to ensure that the correct number has \n\nbeen received. \n\n\u25aa  Check count the House of Representatives ballot papers, noting that if they are \n\nsupplied shrink-wrapped or padded with numbered butts, it can be assumed that each \npack/pad contains the number of ballot papers advised on the packing slip, so only the \nnumber of bundles need to be check counted. \n\n\u25aa  Write the total number of ballot papers received on the House of Representatives and \n\nSenate worksheets in the OIC return, and \n\n\u25aa  Seal the transport container and complete a Record of ballot paper transport container \n\nseals in the presence of a witness. \n\n\u25aa  Wash your hands or use hand sanitiser before and after. \n\nDo not wait until polling day to count the ballot papers. Let the divisional office know \nimmediately if the number of ballot papers does not match the ballot paper inventory.  \n\nBallot papers that are stored in the OIC\u2019s home/accommodation overnight (prior to polling) \nmust be kept in a secure zone. This must be a secure area in your home that is out of public \nview and unlikely to be accessed by others.  \n\nBallot paper secure zone  \n\nDuring the polling place set-up the OIC must establish a secure zone. The secure zone is a \ndesignated area for the storage of ballot papers \u2013 it must be visible to the OIC but not readily \naccessible to the public. Ballot papers for each division in a dual or multi can be stored in the \nsame secure zone but segregation should be maintained at all times.  \n\nCardboard screens will be provided to each polling place which must be used to cordon off the \ndesignated area.   \n\nA lockable internal room may be used as an alternative secure zone provided the room \nremains locked and the only keys are in possession of the OIC. \n\nUnallocated ballot papers must be kept in the transport container inside the secure zone. The \ntransport containers must remain closed but do not need to be sealed during polling.  \n\nThe OIC, PPLO or permanent AEC staff are authorised to access to the secure zone. No other \nstaff should enter unless authorised to do so by the OIC. \n\nBallot boxes \n\nBallot boxes are cardboard or moulded plastic (polypropylene) containers. Although they are \nsealed, they are not a secure container, and should not be left unattended in public view at \nany time. \n\nTravelling with ballot papers \n\nEnsure that ballot papers and completed declaration envelopes are transported inside sealed \ncontainers, out of sight in a fully enclosed, locked vehicle. \n\nLeaving ballot papers or certified lists in a vehicle overnight is strictly prohibited. \n\nElection Procedures Handbook \u2013 PPLO/OIC/2IC     Page 26\n\n\n--- Page 28 ---\n\nOIC records \n\nIntroduction \n\nThe records of your polling place are consolidated in two documents; \n\n1.  the OIC preparation guide, for the period before polling day and  \n2.  the OIC return, for polling day. \n\nIt is essential that you complete these documents accurately in order to account properly for \nballot papers, the conduct of polling and the scrutiny. \n\nOIC Preparation guide \n\nThe OIC preparation guide has been designed to provide you with information to prepare for \npolling day. \n\nIt is broken into two sections: \n\n1.  Section A: checklists \n\nOutlines the tasks to be completed prior to polling day, such as the completion of \ntraining, inspecting the polling place and contacting staff.  It also guides the OIC when \nsetting up the polling place on the day before polling. \n\n2.  Section B: preparation forms \n\nSection B contains the forms that are required prior to polling day to ensure you are \nfully equipped, and to assist with setup of your polling place and managing polling \nstaff. \n\nInventories \n\nSection B of the OIC preparation guide will contain a materials inventory list and a ballot paper \ninventory list. \n\nThese inventories are used to ensure the OIC has received all materials and ballot papers for \nthe polling place. \n\nIt is important that the inventory checks are conducted as soon as possible and that the OIC \ncontacts the divisional office immediately if any items are missing or have been damaged. \n\nWhen check counting ballot papers the OIC must follow the steps listed in Section A to ensure \nballot papers are handled according to AEC policy. The number of ballot papers received by the \nOIC is recorded in the OIC return on the House of Representative and Senate worksheets. \n\nMemorandum to OIC \n\nThis provides key details about your polling place \u2013 the details of the premises, the estimated \nnumbers of votes, and staffing numbers \n\nStaffing forms \n\nTwo forms provided include names and contact information for the staff allocated to your \npolling place, and a form for recording their emergency contact details prior to election day. \n\nElection Procedures Handbook \u2013 PPLO/OIC/2IC     Page 27\n\n\n--- Page 29 ---\n\nPolling place layout \n\nSection B may also contain the polling place layout diagram which will instruct the OIC on how \nto set up the polling place. \n\nThe divisional office may have designed the polling place to allow for things such as privacy for \nvoters when marking their ballot papers, a clear view of voting screens for issuing officers, a \nseparate declaration vote issuing area and smooth voter flow from entrance to exit. \n\nYou should follow this plan as closely as possible. Discuss any modifications with the PPLO. \n\nHub and/or ROM locations \n\nThese forms provide details concerning where your materials should be delivered on polling \ncompletion. \n\nThe OIC Return  \n\nThe OIC return is used on polling day and is a complete record of how the polling place \nfunctioned throughout polling and the scrutiny. \n\nThe return has four sections:  \n\n\u25aa  Section A: checklists of all the tasks to be completed on polling day and night, \n\u25aa  Section B: mandatory forms to be completed throughout polling day and night, \n\u25aa  Section C: circumstantial forms that are only completed in certain circumstances, such \n\nas if a ballot box is opened prematurely, and \n\u25aa  Section D: staffing and work health safety forms. \n\nWhen the OIC return is complete, sign the title page before packing the return for transport. \n\nThe OIC return is the appropriate place to document any accidents, complaints by voters or \nscrutineers, and any other incidents in your polling place. \n\nYou must complete the return throughout the day as events take place. It is important that you \nprovide as much detail as possible; this assists in investigating any matters as required after \npolling day. \n\nIf you have any difficulties completing the return, contact your PPLO. \n\nSection A of the OIC Return \n\nSection A of the OIC return guides you through the tasks required of you as an OIC during and \nafter polling. It also refers you to forms in other sections when required.  \n\nSection A is laid out according to the polling day timeline and starts prior to polling on polling \nday. Ensure you refer to Section A of the OIC return regularly so that your polling place is being \nmanaged according to AEC policy and procedure during and after polling. \n\nThe OIC should delegate tasks where possible, however it is still the OIC\u2019s responsibility to \nensure all tasks are carried out as required. \n\nThe PPLO will be checking the OIC return to ensure it is being completed correctly and the \ndivisional office will also review the return after polling day. \n\nElection Procedures Handbook \u2013 PPLO/OIC/2IC     Page 28\n\n\n--- Page 30 ---\n\nSection B of the OIC Return \n\nSection B consists of the forms and records that the OIC is required to complete throughout \nthe polling period. \n\nWhen you receive your OIC return you should inspect Section B and ensure the forms listed on \nthe table of contents have been included in your return, if any are missing inform your \ndivisional office. Your divisional office may also include more forms if required. \n\nSome forms will be allocated to issuing points or ballot boxes etc. and you will have multiple \ncopies of these. \n\nSubstitute OIC \n\nThis form must be used each time the OIC leaves the polling place for a break. It should be \npre-signed by the OIC, 2IC (or next most senior polling official) and a witness before polling \nstarts and updated each time the OIC leaves the polling place.  \n\nHouse of Representatives and Senate worksheets  \n\nThe House of Representatives and Senate worksheets are used before, during and after \npolling to reconcile the ballot papers allocated to your polling place. At the end of polling it is \nimportant to be able to account for all ballot papers. The two forms are used the same way, so \nwe will use the House of Representatives worksheet as an example here. An explanation of \neach section is on the next page. \n\nElection Procedures Handbook \u2013 PPLO/OIC/2IC     Page 29\n\n\n--- Page 31 ---\n\nElection Procedures Handbook \u2013 PPLO/OIC/2IC     Page 30\n\n\n--- Page 32 ---\n\nPolling place ballot papers section: \n\nAs soon as you receive your ballot paper allocation and OIC return count the ballot papers and \nrecord the number received in the top section of the House of Representatives and Senate \nworksheets. If the DRO or PPLO allocates more ballot papers to your polling place, or takes any \nfrom your polling place, you must also record those figures on the top section. This gives you \nthe total number of ballot papers you must account for after polling. \n\nIn the worked example 2400 House of Representatives ballot papers were initially allocated, \nand at some stage the PPLO transferred 100 ballot papers from this polling place to give to a \nneighbouring polling place. \n\nIssuing point ballot papers section: \n\nDuring polling: the left side of this section is used every time you allocate ballot papers to an \nissuing point. In this worked example there are 4 ordinary issuing points (identified by the \ncertified list number). The ordinary issuing officer should have also recorded these allocations \non the certified list coversheets. There are two declaration vote issuing points (identified by \nissuing point number) and they should have recorded the same figures on the Ballot paper \ntracking forms. \n\nAfter polling: the right side of the worksheet is used to reconcile the ballot papers. Looking at \nthe first ordinary issuing officer row we can see that issuing point 1001 was allocated 400 \nballot papers over the day, had to replace 6 spoilt ballot papers and had 73 unused. This \nmeans 321 votes were issued by this issuing point. The subtotal for ordinary vote issuing \npoints tells us how many ballot papers have been issued and it should balance with the \nnumber counted during the scrutiny plus any discarded ballot papers. \n\nElection Procedures Handbook \u2013 PPLO/OIC/2IC     Page 31\n\n\n--- Page 33 ---\n\nFinal reconciliation section: \n\nThis section can be fully completed once the scrutiny has been conducted. Complete the \ncalculations on the form and ideally the difference field will be zero, meaning you have \naccounted for every ballot paper. If the balance is not zero you should double check \ncalculations, quickly search the polling place for missing ballot papers and if required do one \n(only) quick recount of ballot papers, however there are a few reasons why you may not \naccount for all ballot papers, as described on page 72. \n\nThere is a pre-filled example of this form in the OIC return that explains which sections are \nfilled in during polling and which are filled in after polling. \n\nElection Procedures Handbook \u2013 PPLO/OIC/2IC     Page 32\n\n\n--- Page 34 ---\n\nOIC result of count \u2013 House of Representatives and Senate \n\nThese forms are used to record the results for the House of Representatives first preference \nscrutiny and the Senate count. Once recorded the figures are phoned through to the divisional \noffice. \n\nTwo candidate preferred forms  \n\nThe TCP forms are supplied in a sealed envelope. They consist of the Direction to count further \npreferences form, which provides instructions for the OIC on the two candidates, and the OIC \ntwo-candidate preferred worksheet which is used to record the results of the TCP and then \nphone the figures through to the divisional office. \n\nYou are not to open the envelope until after 6pm. \n\nOIC Identification \n\nThe OIC Identification is a unique code that you need to read out to the divisional office each \ntime you phone through scrutiny results. \n\nThe OIC Identification will be provided to you in the sealed envelope with the TCP forms and \nshould be kept secure at all times. \n\nBallot paper tracking form \n\nA copy of this form is to be given to each declaration vote issuing point.  \n\nEach time you allocate ballot papers to the issuing point, you record it on the House of \nRepresentatives and Senate worksheets, and the declaration vote issuing officer must record \nit on this form, with House of Representative ballot papers tracked at division level. \n\nAt close of poll the total number of spoilt ballot papers, unused ballot papers and declaration \nenvelopes issued must be totalled for each division.  \n\nOnce complete, this worksheet is given to you and you must amalgamate the figures from each \nBallot paper tracking form on the Summary of declaration votes issued form.  \n\nThese worksheets must be placed in the OIC return on completion. \n\nSummary of declaration votes issued  \n\nUsing the Ballot paper tracking forms that have been completed by your declaration vote \nissuing officers, record the number of declaration votes issued at every declaration vote \nissuing point for each division.   \n\nThe totals should balance with the House of Representatives and Senate worksheets. \n\nRecord of postal vote certificates  \n\nIf any postal votes are handed in to the polling place, including any cancelled postal votes, \nrecord details on this page. \n\nRecord of voters in queue \n\nThis page is completed each hour and records the number of voters that have passed through \n(as recorded by ballot box guard clicker) and number of voters in the queue.  \n\nElection Procedures Handbook \u2013 PPLO/OIC/2IC     Page 33\n\n\n--- Page 35 ---\n\nSection C of the OIC Return \n\nSection C of the OIC return contains forms that you only need to fill in if the circumstance calls \nfor it, such as if a ballot box opened prematurely. \n\nIssues and miscellaneous matters  \n\nThis form is to be completed if there are any issues, complaints, disturbances or unusual \nmatters during polling or during the scrutiny. It should also be used for any additional notes for \nthe divisional office, for example about the suitability of the polling place for electors or staff. \n\nReport polling issues such as excessive queues or if tamper evident tape on parcelled ballot \npapers/packaged material has been broken while still in the polling place.  \n\nYou should also record on this form any incidents that prevent a staff member from taking a \nrequired meal break e.g., they refuse to take a break even after the requirement is explained \nto them. \n\nPrematurely opened ballot box report \n\nThe Prematurely opened ballot box report is to be completed if a ballot box is opened \nprematurely \u2013 that is before 6pm. \n\nYou must include as much detail as possible including the circumstances of the ballot box \nbeing opened and details of all witnesses. \n\nThis form is to be given to the DRO as soon as possible after the ballot box is opened, along \nwith the ballot box and all ballot papers/declaration vote envelopes that have been removed \nfrom the ballot box (if any). See Troubleshooting on page 96 for more information on \nprematurely opened ballot boxes. \n\nSection D of the OIC Return \n\nSection D contains forms required for staffing and workplace health and safety, such as \nattendance records and the meal break roster. \n\nIncident notification form  \n\nIf there are any health and safety incidents or hazards identified during the day, record the \ndetails on the Incident Notification form. Please note the following broad definitions: \n\n\u25aa  hazard \u2013 the potential to cause harm to people, property or environment, \n\u25aa  near hit \u2013 incident that did not result in harm to a person, property or the \n\nenvironment, and \nincident - harm to people, property or environment. \n\n\u25aa \n\nYou must provide comprehensive details about the incident. \n\nAttendance record \n\nThis record is to assist the divisional office in processing payments. You must ensure all staff \nsign this form on arrival.  \n\nElection Procedures Handbook \u2013 PPLO/OIC/2IC     Page 34\n\n\n--- Page 36 ---\n\nOIC and Staff assessment \n\nThe OIC uses this form when assessing polling staff performance of their duties. Ratings are to \nbe recorded against each staff member using the rating scale on the report. Ensure you read \nthe rating scale carefully in order to accurately apply the correct rating to each staff member. \nInclude comments for all staff. \n\nMeal break roster  \n\nThe meal break roster allows you to plan your staff breaks ahead of time by blocking out the \nhalf hour break for each staff member. \n\nPolling place set-up \nOne of your duties is to prepare the polling place on polling eve.  \n\nThe OIC preparation guide provides instructions of the tasks to \nbe completed when setting up the polling place.  \n\nDo not erect external signs until polling day. \n\nThe polling place will need to be set up to encourage 1.5m \ndistancing where possible. The following measures will assist in \nimplementing the physical distancing and sanitisation \nrequirements: \n\n\u25aa \n\n\u25aa \n\n\u25aa \n\u25aa \n\n\u25aa \n\nMark the floor with cloth tape (do not use tamper evident tape for this), to identify \nwhere voters should stand. Cut 20cm length strips of tape to create crosses on the \nground: \no  at issuing points, \no \no \n\nin mini queues of one, 1.5m from the first mark (if space permits), \nin the main queue outside the polling place. It is suggested that at least 6 \nmarks 1.5m apart be put on the floor so that there is clear distancing for voters \narriving at the polling place. Depending on the venue, it may be more effective \nto use long strips of tape to mark lines rather than crosses for the external \nqueue \n\nA table at the entry of the polling place for hand sanitiser. Please ensure this is in a \nprominent spot.  \nA table at the exit of the polling place for hand sanitiser.  \n\nEach issuing point must have easy access to hand sanitiser (within reach while \nseated). Hand sanitiser on issuing desks should not be placed near the ballot \npapers. \nVoting screens set up: \no  1.5m distanced standalone against a wall, \no  Two screens back-to-back 1.5m distanced, or \no  Screen bank established with issuing officers to manage distancing (least \n\npreferred) \n\nNote: If the floor is wooden, vote screens may move during the day. The OIC must ensure that \nvoting screens are re-positioned as needed. Tape can be used to assist with fastening to \nfloor, if required.  \n\nElection Procedures Handbook \u2013 PPLO/OIC/2IC     Page 35\n\n\n--- Page 37 ---\n\n\u25aa  Every voter screen should have a plastic insert. \n\u25aa  A separate table for declaration voters to complete their envelope, in front of the \n\ndeclaration vote issuing table.  \n\n\u25aa  COVID-19 safety measures posters placed outside near the queue, and at locations \n\ninside the polling place. \n\n\u25aa  Venue capacity poster at the entrance to the polling place. \n\u25aa  QR code signs for checking in to the polling place at intervals along the path of \ntravel to the entrance to the polling place. This encourages people to check in \nbefore reaching the entry of the polling place and avoiding a bottleneck.   \n\nUse the sanitising spray to wipe down tables and voting screens and other equipment as \nnecessary, once you have set up the polling place on polling eve. The hygiene officer should \nalways spray onto the paper towel rather than directly onto election equipment. Used personal \nprotective equipment (PPE) should be disposed of in a dedicated PPE bin that is double lined. \n\nPolling place access \n\nWhere parking is limited, polling staff, scrutineers and party workers should be asked to park \nfurther away from the polling place during polling hours. \n\nAt polling places that do not have permanent disabled parking spaces, and where safe to do \nso, the disabled parking signs should be placed in a car park close to the entrance of the \npolling place first thing in the morning on polling day.  \n\nRubbish bins \n\nThe AEC provides cardboard bins in polling places.  \n\nAEC bins should be placed at the exit of the polling area so that voters \nmust walk past the ballot boxes before they reach the bin and where the \nballot box guard is able to view the bins.  \n\nUsed PPE should be disposed of in a separately marked bin, with two bin \nliners. Your polling place has been provided with: \n\n\u25aa  a second cardboard bin, \n\n\u25aa  two bin liners for this bin, and \n\n\u25aa  a sign indicating this bin is for used PPE only  \n\nWhen disposing of used PPE: \n\n\u25aa  remove mask (or gloves), \n\n\u25aa  place in labelled cardboard bin, \n\n\u25aa  when bin is full seal both bin liners, and \n\n\u25aa  dispose of as part of general waste. \n\nUsed sanitising wipes can be disposed of with general waste. \n\nElection Procedures Handbook \u2013 PPLO/OIC/2IC     Page 36\n\n\n--- Page 38 ---\n\nLayout \n\nThe OIC preparation guide may contain a plan for the layout of the polling place. You should \nfollow this plan as closely as possible. Discuss any modifications with your PPLO. \n\nThe layout of the polling place should allow: \n\n\u25aa  orderly access (if the polling place has two doors, use one as the entry and the \n\nother as the exit) with a single direction of movement throughout the polling place \nso that voters flow through easily with minimal cross over, \n\n\u25aa  physically distanced bank-style queuing of voters (a single queue at one point, \n\naway from the issuing points but well within the polling place when possible) and \nmini queues at each issuing point (where space permits). To ensure the continuous \nflow of voters, mini queues of one voter should then be maintained in front of each \nissuing officer so there is minimal delay while the voter walks to the issuing point, \n\u25aa  a clear view of the voting screens for issuing staff, so they can control voter flow, \n\u25aa  privacy for voters while they mark their ballot papers, \n\u25aa  constant supervision of the ballot boxes, \n\u25aa  space to set up an additional issuing point if lengthy delays occur during peak \n\nperiods, \n\n\u25aa  a separate declaration voting area with its own ballot box and voter flow that does \n\nnot interrupt the ordinary issuing voter flow, \n\n\u25aa  a separate voter flow for any guest divisions issuing votes in a dual/multi polling \n\nplace, and clearly sign-posted ballot boxes for each division, \n\n\u25aa  hand sanitising stations and pencil collection/drop-off at the entry and exit of the \n\npolling place, \n\n\u25aa  bins placed at the exit of the polling premises, past the ballot boxes, for general \n\nwaste and used PPE, \nthe OIC table located with a view of all areas of the polling place, and \n\n\u25aa \n\u25aa  ballot paper secure zone that is visible to the OIC but not accessible to the public \n\nand maintains segregation of ballot papers for host and guest divisions. \n\nThe layout of voting screens has been remodelled to reflect COVID-19 safety measures. OICs \nshould aim to set up a minimum of one voting screen per 100 voters, using the vote estimates \nprovided in the Memorandum to OIC in your OIC static preparation guide. You will have been \nsupplied with extra screens which can be assembled if there is room to do so.  \n\nThe configuration used will depend on the size and layout of the polling place. At all times, the \nmost important consideration is to ensure physical distancing between voters. Following are \nsuggested configurations in order of preference: \n\nElection Procedures Handbook \u2013 PPLO/OIC/2IC     Page 37\n\n\n--- Page 39 ---\n\n1.  Against a wall  \n\nVoting screens are set up against a wall with \n1.5m separating each screen. \n\nThe wall provides stability for each screen and \nprovides a clear 1.5m separation. \n\nThis layout provides ease of management for \nissuing officers.  \n\n2.  Back to back \n\nTwo screens back-to-back, secured at the top \nwith a fold back clip (fold back clips used to \nsecure Senate ballot papers can be used for \nthis purpose). \n\nThe fold back clips assist to provide stability to \nvoting screens.  \n\n3.  Bank of screens \n\nThis layout should be used if the polling place \ndoes not have a suitable wall to place screens \nagainst. \n\nIf using this layout issuing officers should direct \nvoters to the most appropriate vote screens to \nmanage physical distancing between voters.  \n\nThis layout requires greater staff management \nof voters.  \n\nExtra supplies of other cardboard (issuing point boxes, ballot boxes, queuing equipment) \nshould be used on an as needed basis. Due to COVID-safe measures pencils with string should \nNOT be attached to voting screens as voters are instead encouraged to collect a clean pencil \nat the entrance to the polling place. \n\nThe examples shown below incorporate these principles. Consider them when setting up your \npolling place if the divisional office has not provided a plan. \n\nElection Procedures Handbook \u2013 PPLO/OIC/2IC     Page 38\n\n\n--- Page 40 ---\n\nElection Procedures Handbook \u2013 PPLO/OIC/2IC     Page 39\n\n\n--- Page 41 ---\n\nPolling day \n\nPrior to 8am \nThe OIC return provides guidance for polling day before 8am to ensure the polling place and \nstaff are ready for polling to commence at 8am. \n\nOIC arrival \n\nBoth the OIC and the 2IC must arrive at the polling place no later than 7am. \n\nYou must bring your Confirmation of casual employment form, all polling materials, a fully \ncharged mobile phone (and charger) and all the keys required to open the polling place.  \n\nStaff arrival \n\nPolling staff should arrive and be ready to start work by 7am so they can be briefed and assist \nwith the preparation for the start of polling. It is critical that all staff arrive on time. \n\nIf any staff member has not arrived by 7:50am, contact the PPLO.  \n\nOn arrival, you must sight their Confirmation of casual employment form, proof of COVID-19 \nvaccination status and issue them with their identification badge and the appropriate vest. If a \nstaff member does not produce their confirmation form, confirm their employment using the \nlatest staffing list provided. Collect any forms provided to you by staff and store them in \nSection D of the OIC return. All polling place staff will be allocated a vest and ID badge \ncorresponding to their role when on duty. These must be removed on breaks, and returned at \nthe end of their shift.  \n\nStaff must sign the attendance record before commencing duties. \n\nAllocation of duties \n\nAs outlined in Roles of all other staff on page 14, polling officials will have been allocated to \none of two groups: \n\n\u25aa  ordinary issuing officer, ballot box guard, queue controller, hygiene officer and part \n\nday staff \n\n\u25aa  declaration vote issuing officer or inquiry officer. \n\nStaff can be rotated between various functions, but only within their group, as they have not \nbeen trained to perform the duties of another group.  \n\nOnly in emergency situations (such as non-attendance), should you move staff between \ngroups. In such cases, consult your PPLO. You must then provide on-the-job instruction for the \npolling official.  \n\nIn addition to the materials allocated to ordinary and declaration issuing points during set-up, \nthe following are required: \n\nBallot box guard materials \n\nBallot box guards require a clicker (counter) to count ordinary voters as they place their ballot \npapers in the ballot boxes. \n\nElection Procedures Handbook \u2013 PPLO/OIC/2IC     Page 40\n\n\n--- Page 42 ---\n\nQueue controller materials \n\nQueue controllers require a queuing record and a pen.     \n\nInquiry officer materials \nInquiry officers require a division finder and a How to Vote Guide. \n\nHygiene officer materials \n\nHygiene officers require gloves, sanitising spray and paper towels. \n\nDistribution of ballot papers and certified lists \n\nBallot papers must be distributed to ordinary issuing and declaration issuing points before \npolling commences. Once the transport container has been unsealed to distribute ballot \npapers it must remain closed within the secure zone, but does not need to be sealed during \npolling. Certified lists are allocated to each ordinary issuing point. \n\nMaterials at ordinary and declaration vote issuing \npoints should be set out close by so that repetitive \nreaching or twisting is minimised. Staff should take \ninto account whether they are left or right handed \nwhen working out where to place ballot papers on \ntheir table so that they can easily initial them and \nhand over when issuing to voters.   \n\nNote: If an issuing officer is on a scheduled break or \nan issuing point is being closed, ballot papers and, if \napplicable, the certified list must be packed into the \nstorage box and given to the OIC for storage in the \nsecure zone. \n\nOrdinary issuing point  \n\nOICs must allocate no more than half of their total ballot paper allocation to ordinary vote \nissuing officers at the start of the day. \n\nAdditional ballot papers are to be allocated as required throughout the day.  \n\nThese steps should be followed every time ballot papers are provided to issuing officers: \n\n\u25aa  Count the individual ballot papers and record the total number of ballot papers \n\nprovided to each issuing point on the House of Representatives \u2013 Worksheet and \nSenate \u2013 Worksheet in the OIC return, and \n\n\u25aa  The issuing officer should count and record the number of ballot papers received \n\non the certified list coversheet. If there is a discrepancy, it should be checked and, \nif necessary, adjusted using your reserve. \n\nThe issuing officers are to retain the stubs from fully used booklets and return them to you with \ntheir unused ballot papers after the close of polling. \n\nElection Procedures Handbook \u2013 PPLO/OIC/2IC     Page 41\n\n\n--- Page 43 ---\n\nDeclaration vote issuing points \n\nDeclaration vote issuing points receive the following ballot papers before polling begins: \n\n\u25aa  a supply of House of Representatives ballot papers for the division in which the \n\npolling place is situated (for provisional voters), \n\n\u25aa  absent packs - packs of fully printed House of Representatives ballot papers for all \nother divisions within the state/territory. These should be stored in the declaration \nballot paper holder and divided, by division, using the ballot paper dividers,  \n\u2018open\u2019 House of Representatives ballot papers (for use as a last resort only). These \nare blank ballot papers that can be turned into a ballot paper for any division by \ncopying the exact details of the candidates for a division as shown in the list of \ncandidates booklet, and \n\n\u25aa \n\n\u25aa  Senate ballot papers. \n\nThese steps should be followed every time ballot papers are provided to declaration issuing \nofficers: \n\n\u25aa  count all the ballot papers allocated, including those provided as declaration \n\npacks, and record the total number of papers provided to each issuing point on the \nHouse of Representatives and Senate Worksheets in the OIC return, \nthe issuing officer must count and record the number of each ballot paper received \non the Ballot paper tracking form. \n\n\u25aa \n\nPrepare outside of polling place \n\nPolling place boundary \n\nThe divisional office will advise you if the building \nor the entire grounds will be designated as a \npolling place. \n\nIf the entire grounds are to be considered as the \npolling place, the electoral offences sign must be \ndisplayed at each entrance to the grounds. \n\nIf only the building is considered the polling place, \nthe electoral offences sign must be displayed at \neach entrance to the part of the building in which \npolling is conducted. \n\nParty workers must remain at least six metres away from the boundary. \n\nThe sign should be placed so that it is easy to see and read when voters enter the polling \nplace. \n\nEXAMPLE: If a school building is used as a polling place and notices are displayed at each \nentrance to the grounds, the entire school grounds are part of the polling place. The school \nboundary fence becomes the perimeter of the polling place. If this is the case party workers \nmust remain at least six metres outside the school grounds. \n\nElection Procedures Handbook \u2013 PPLO/OIC/2IC     Page 42\n\n\n--- Page 44 ---\n\nAsk your staff to: \n\n\u25aa  make sure that all designated entrances and exits, including doors and gates are \n\nunlocked, \n\n\u25aa  erect all the necessary outside signs, for example \u2018polling place\u2019 banner and \n\n\u2018electoral offences\u2019 poster, and \nrectify any hazardous areas that may lead to accidents. \n\n\u25aa \n\nBriefing staff and scrutineers \n\nStaff \n\nStaff must be briefed on their duties and responsibilities before the polling place opens at \n8am. This is especially important for staff working in the ordinary issuing officers/ballot box \nguards/queue controller roles as they have not received training. \n\nThe OIC return instructs you on the timing of the brief and the script you should follow when \nbriefing your staff.  \n\nTaking time to brief staff before polling can prevent mistakes during the day and allow time for \nstaff to familiarise themselves with the materials they will be using during the day. \n\nEnsure staff are ready to commence polling duties at 8am sharp. \n\nEnsure staff know that they cannot access the secure zone unless explicitly authorised by the \nOIC. Otherwise, only the OIC, PPLO, or permanent AEC staff can access the secure zone. \n\nEnsure staff know that ballot papers and certified lists must be supervised at all times and, if \nleaving the issuing point, must be returned to the OIC in the issuing point storage box for \nsecure storage in the secure zone. \n\nScrutineers \n\nIf there are any scrutineers appointed to observe polling use the OIC return to assist with their \nbriefing.  \n\nAll scrutineers must wear a designated scrutineer identification badge attached to a lanyard \nwhilst in the polling place. \n\nThere is more information on scrutineers in the \u2018Candidates, Party Workers and Scrutineers\u2019 \nsection on page 87. \n\nSealing of the ballot box \n\nIt\u2019s important that the ballot boxes are sealed and ready for use before the first voter is ready \nto place their ballot papers in the ballot boxes. If it is a dual or multi polling place, separate \nballot boxes must be set-up for each division, and clearly marked and managed accordingly. \n\nFor each ordinary ballot box: \n\nOrdinary ballot boxes are made of cardboard \n\n\u25aa  Show the empty ballot box to any scrutineers or staff present. \n\u25aa  Close and seal the ballot box by threading numbered plastic security seals through \n\nthe holes at each end. \n\nElection Procedures Handbook \u2013 PPLO/OIC/2IC     Page 43\n\n\n--- Page 45 ---\n\n\u25aa  Record details of the security seal numbers on the Record of ballot boxes and \n\nSecurity Seals and file in the OIC return. \n\n\u25aa  Have a witness (scrutineer or polling official) sign your entry.  \n\u25aa  Wash your hands or use hand sanitiser before and after, and \n\u25aa  Repeat this process during the day if additional ballot boxes are required. \n\nA sealed ordinary ballot box must NOT be opened until after 6pm on polling day. If a ballot box \nis opened prior to 6pm there are strict procedures that must be followed by the OIC. See \nTroubleshooting on page 96 for more information. \n\nFor each declaration ballot box: \n\nDeclaration ballot boxes are made of plastic and have a lid that is sealed to the container, with \na slot that is open during polling for the ballot papers, in declaration envelopes, to be inserted. \n\n\u25aa  Show the empty ballot box to any scrutineers or staff present. \n\u25aa  Close and seal the ballot box by threading numbered plastic security seals through \n\ntwo opposing sides of the lid. \n\n\u25aa  Record details of the security seal numbers on a Record of security seals form. \n\u25aa  Have a witness (scrutineer, party worker or polling official) sign the entry, and \n\u25aa  Place the Record of security seals form in the plastic window on the ballot box, this \n\nform must always stay with this ballot box and \n\n\u25aa  Wash your hands or use hand sanitiser before and after. \n\nNote that declaration ballot boxes must NOT be opened until after 6pm on polling day. If a \nballot box is opened prior to 6pm there are strict procedures that must be followed by the OIC. \nSee Troubleshooting on page 96 for more information. \n\nDuring polling \n\nOpen the polling place \n\n8am \n\nJust before 8am check the time so that the polling place opens at exactly 8am. \nVisiting https://time.is/ will give an accurate time. \n\nAt precisely 8am, the OIC opens the polling place and admits anyone waiting to \nvote. The OIC then signs the declaration in the OIC return to declare that the polling \nplace was opened at the correct time. \n\nMonitoring  \n\nStaff and procedures \n\nAs soon as possible after 8am and again at regular intervals, you should move around the \npolling place, listening to the questioning method used by staff, ensuring they are explaining \nhow to correctly fill in each ballot paper, watching what they are doing, and checking forms and \nother paperwork. Also check that the specific COVID-19 procedures are being followed, such as \nphysical distancing, sanitising after every 10th voter, and voters and staff using hand sanitiser. \n\nElection Procedures Handbook \u2013 PPLO/OIC/2IC     Page 44\n\n\n--- Page 46 ---\n\nIf there are problems, speak to the relevant staff member and explain the correct procedure. \nCheck periodically that the problems do not recur. If they do, it may be necessary to move that \nperson to a different position.  \n\nSection A in the OIC return will prompt you to monitor staff several times over the day. Of high \nimportance is:  \n\nfollowing COVID-19 safety measures, \n\n\u25aa \n\u25aa  marking certified lists correctly, \n\u25aa  completing the certified list coversheet (ordinary issuing points) and ballot paper \ntracking form (declaration issuing point) as soon as ballot papers are allocated \n\n\u25aa  queues being managed correctly including the use of mini-queues, \n\u25aa  asking the 3 questions (ordinary issuing officers), \n\u25aa \n\nfollowing the declaration vote issuing procedure (declaration vote issuing officers), \nand \n\n\u25aa  directing silent electors to the OIC or 2IC. \n\nIf there is a 2IC they should be responsible for monitoring the issue of declaration votes. \n\nThe polling place should be maintained in a neat and tidy and fully serviceable condition at all \ntimes (pencils sharpened, posters correctly displayed, voting screens cleared of litter, etc.).  \n\nStaff ratings \n\nAs an OIC, you are required to assess staff in the performance of their duties and assign them \na rating. These ratings are important for future election staffing and need to be carefully \nconsidered. You must ensure that you observe staff throughout the day to assist in completing \nthe assessment.  \n\nAfter polling, ratings are to be recorded on the OIC and staff report that is included in the OIC \nreturn. \n\nPlease provide a comment beside staff that should be considered for promotion to the next \nlevel, and if possible indicate staff who should be considered first for promotion.  \n\nBallot paper security  \n\nAll polling staff must take every precaution with allocated ballot papers in their care and never \nleave ballot papers unattended. The OIC must never leave the reserve stock of ballot papers in \npublic view.  The reserve stock must be stored in the transport container within the secure \nzone. \n\nIf issuing officers have to leave their issuing point or an issuing point is closed at any time, \nballot papers and certified lists must be removed from issuing points, put into issuing point \nstorage boxes and given to the OIC for safekeeping in the secure zone.  \n\nBallot boxes that are full must remain with the ballot box guard or, if that restricts voter flow, in \nthe secure zone. \n\nElection Procedures Handbook \u2013 PPLO/OIC/2IC     Page 45\n\n\n--- Page 47 ---\n\nStaff breaks \n\nIf you close an issuing point to allow staff to have a break, leave the same issuing point closed \nfor all breaks and rotate staff through the open issuing point(s) where applicable. \n\nIssuing points must be sanitised when there is a changeover of staff. The declaration moulded \nballot box should also be wiped over with changeover of staff. Spray onto the paper towel, not \nonto the ballot box. \n\nQueue control and voter flow \n\nThe queue controller(s) and, where employed, inquiry officer should \nwork together to control the flow of voters through the polling place. \nIssuing officers can assist by not issuing ballot papers to voters until a \nvoting screen is available. \n\n\u25aa  Generally the start of the queue will be at the entrance to \n\nthe polling place, to promoted adherence to capacity limits. \nA queue controller will be at the head of the queue \nmanaging voter flow into and within the polling place, and \nmonitoring the external queue to ensure voters are \nmaintaining 1.5m distance. \n\n\u25aa  The queue controller will be directing voters to available \n\nissuing points. If issuing points are busy, the voters will be \ndirected to a mini queue of one person behind each issuing \npoint, if space permits. \n\n\u25aa  The queue controller will be responsible for ensuring the maximum number of \n\npeople allowed inside the polling place at one time is not exceeded. Larger polling \nplaces will be allocated a second queue controller for this purpose, to ensure a \nstrict one\u2013out, one-in policy is followed if the polling place is at capacity. The \nsecond person will be monitoring the exit, the overall number of voters in the \npolling place, and communicating with the queue controller at the entrance \nregarding any issues with numbers or voter flow. \nIt is important that the queue controller/s are monitoring the overall voter flow in \nthe polling place so that queueing inside the polling place is minimised. \n\n\u25aa \n\n\u25aa  Sometimes voters arrive in family groups. These voters will be expected to queue \n\nseparately once inside the polling place and should not be encouraged to approach \nan issuing point together, unless a voter requires assistance. Children can stay \nwith an adult but will count towards the total number of people inside the polling \nplace. \n\n\u25aa  Voters requiring help may request assistance and can be sent to the front of the \nqueue. This may include voters with a disability or those who are elderly or \npregnant. \n\n\u25aa  Queue controllers direct voters to collect pencils at entrance. \n\nQueue controllers can also assist with manual registration of voters for COVID-\ntracing purposes if necessary. \n\nElection Procedures Handbook \u2013 PPLO/OIC/2IC     Page 46\n\n\n--- Page 48 ---\n\nIssuing ordinary votes \nThe ordinary issuing process includes the following safety measures: \n\n\u25aa  ordinary issuing officer to sanitise hands every 10 voters, \n\u25aa \n\nthe hygiene officer will be required to sanitise the issuing area every 10 voters \nor every 15 minutes, and \n\n\u25aa  ordinary issuing officers are to assist in keeping track and alert the hygiene \n\nofficer when required. The issuing officer table should be sanitised whenever \nthere is a changeover of staff. \n\nIssuing votes to ordinary voters involves 3 steps: \n\n1.  Asking the voter the three questions, \n2.  Marking their name off the certified list, and \n3.  Handing the initialled ballot papers to the voter with instructions on how to complete \n\neach ballot correctly. \n\nStep 1 - Ask the voter the three questions \n\nOrdinary vote issuing officers must ask voters the following three questions prior to marking \ntheir name off the certified list: \n\nQuestion 1 \u2018What is your full name? \n\nIf the voter\u2019s name is found on the certified list, ask the voter question two.  \n\nIf the voter\u2019s name cannot be found on the certified list, confirm the correct spelling or ask if \nthey may be enrolled under a different surname. If the voter still cannot be found, the voter \nshould be directed to the declaration vote issuing point. \n\nSee the Troubleshooting section of this manual for more information on finding a voter\u2019s name \non the certified list. \n\nQuestion 2 \u2018Where do you live?\u2019 \n\nNote: Included in the certified list are names for which address details are not shown. These \nare silent, itinerant or designated electors who must be directed to the OIC or 2IC to be issued \nwith a declaration vote. These entries must not be marked on the certified list. See electors \nwith address suppressed on page 54 for more information. \n\nIf the address given is the same as the one on the certified list, ask the voter question three. \n\nIf it is a previous address for the voter, they should be asked to update their enrolment online. \nThen ask them question three as an ordinary vote can still be issued. \n\nIf the address is a place where the voter has never lived, the entry is probably for a different \nperson. Direct the voter to the declaration vote issuing point. \n\nQuestion 3 \u2018Have you voted before in this election?\u2019 \n\nIf the voter answers \u2018No\u2019, they are issued with an ordinary vote. \n\nIf the answer is \u2018No\u2019, but the name is already marked as having voted on the certified list, \ndirect the voter to the declaration vote issuing point. \n\nElection Procedures Handbook \u2013 PPLO/OIC/2IC     Page 47\n\n\n--- Page 49 ---\n\nIf the answer is \u2018Yes\u2019, you must first be sure that the \nquestion is understood. Rephrase the question; for example, \n\u2018When and where did you vote in this election?\u2019 If the answer \nis still \u2018Yes\u2019 the voter cannot vote again; you must advise \nthem that the law allows a voter to vote only once in an \nelection. \n\nQuestions over voter identity \n\nIf there is any question as to the identity of a voter they \nshould be referred to the OIC. If, after making enquiries, you \ncannot find the person on the certified list, the usual \nprocedure is to issue the person with a declaration vote. \n\nSee the Troubleshooting section of this manual for more information on voter identity. \n\nStep 2 - Mark the certified list \n\nThe voter\u2019s name must be marked off the certified list by the ordinary issuing officer before \nballot papers are issued. The OIC must ensure the issuing officer is marking the certified list \ncorrectly as follows: \n\nMark the certified list only with the special black pen provided. Using the certified list ruler, \ndraw one continuous line between the arrowheads to the left of the voter\u2019s name.  \n\nDo not draw through the number or the name. If this happens make sure to also draw between \nthe arrow heads. \n\nSee the Troubleshooting section of this manual for procedures to correct a mistake when \nmarking the certified list. \n\nStep 3 \u2013 Issue ballot papers \n\nBefore ballot papers are issued, the issuing officer must initial the circle on the front of each \nballot paper given to the voter.  \n\nThe issuing officer should use their real initials and ballot papers are not to be pre-initialled.  \n\nWait until there is a vacant voting screen. This is important to control voter flow.  \n\nElection Procedures Handbook \u2013 PPLO/OIC/2IC     Page 48\n\n\n--- Page 50 ---\n\nTell the voter the following: \n\n\u201cFor the House of Representatives, complete the ballot paper by placing a number one \nin the box next to the candidate who is your first choice, and then number every box in \nthe order of your choice.  \n\nFor the Senate, complete the ballot paper by numbering at least six boxes above the \nline OR by numbering at least twelve boxes below the line, \nin order of your choice. You can continue numbering as \nmany additional boxes as you choose.  \n\nIf you make a mistake, bring the ballot paper back to me \nand I will give you another one.\u201d \n\nNote: there will be a placecard at each issuing point that includes \nthe above script, so issuing officers don\u2019t have to memorise this. \n\nBefore being directed to an empty voting screen, the voter should \nbe informed that assistance is available if required and that they \nmust fold their ballot papers and put them in the correct ballot \nboxes after voting. Also advise the voter to ensure they take \neverything with them out of the polling place, and to dispose of \npencils in the receptacle provided at exit. \n\nSee page 58 for information on assisting voters who need help \ncompleting their ballot papers. \n\nThe golden rules for issuing ordinary votes \n\nEnsure that you ask the three questions. \n\nInitial both ballot papers before handing them to the voter, do not pre-initial ballot papers. \n\nTake care to mark the correct voter off the certified list between the arrow heads. \n\nEnsure the security of ballot papers and certified lists by returning them to the OIC if your \nissuing point will be left unsupervised. \n\nAssist with voter flow by only handing the ballot papers to the voter when there is a vacant \nvoting screen.  \n\nDeclaration votes \nThe following describes how to issue a declaration vote. This will be done by a declaration vote \nissuing officer/inquiry officer or 2IC/OIC only. \n\nThe declaration issuing process includes the following safety measures: \n\n\u25aa  declaration vote issuing officer to sanitise hands after every 10 votes, \n\u25aa  declaration voter should collect a clean pen to complete declaration envelope and \nballot paper (unless they brought their own). When returned the declaration vote \nissuing officer should ensure the voter deposits the pen in the used pens \ncontainer. The declaration vote issuing officer should ensure there is a stock of \nclean pens and may need to advise the hygiene officer to sanitise used pens,  \n\nElection Procedures Handbook \u2013 PPLO/OIC/2IC     Page 49\n\n\n--- Page 51 ---\n\n\u25aa  where possible, an additional table will be placed in front of the declaration issuing \ndesk so that the voter completes their declaration envelope at a separate table to \nthe issuing officer, \nthe hygiene officer will be required to wipe down the declaration issuing area after \nevery 10 votes or 15 minutes. \n\n\u25aa \n\nIntroduction  \n\nDeclaration votes are issued to voters who cannot cast an ordinary vote on polling day. See \n\u2018Absent vote\u2019 and \u2018Provisional vote\u2019 below for more information. \n\nBefore they are given ballot papers, declaration voters must record their details on a \ndeclaration vote envelope. The front of the declaration envelope can be seen in detail on page \n117.  \n\nThe declaration vote envelope has a counterfoil (non-carbon copy paper) inside it that is \nremoved after the envelope has been completed.  \n\nOnce the declaration voter has voted, their completed ballot papers are inserted into the \ndeclaration vote envelope which is sealed and inserted into the ballot box and will later be \nforwarded to the division in which the voter is claiming to be enrolled. \n\nTypes of declaration votes  \n\nAbsent vote \n\nAn absent vote is issued to voters from the \nsame state/territory but a different division to \nthe polling place.  \n\nProvisional vote \n\nA provisional vote is issued when the voter \nclaims to be enrolled for the issuing division, \nbut: \n\n\u25aa \n\u25aa \n\u25aa \n\u25aa \n\ntheir name cannot be found on the certified list, \ntheir name on the certified list is already marked as having voted, \ntheir name, but not their address, is on the certified list (a silent elector), or \ntheir identity cannot be confirmed for an ordinary vote. \n\nIf a voter could not be found on the certified list, they can be advised they can check their \nenrolment online at aec.gov.au. They should be offered a declaration vote if there is any doubt \nor they believe they are enrolled in the division. \n\nInterstate vote \n\nA voter who is enrolled in a division in a state or territory other than the state or territory you \nare in will require an interstate vote. \n\nYour polling place cannot issue votes for other states/territories. This voter must be referred to \na polling place that can issue interstate votes. A list of these locations will be supplied by the \ndivisional office. \n\nElection Procedures Handbook \u2013 PPLO/OIC/2IC     Page 50\n\n\n--- Page 52 ---\n\nSecrecy of the vote \n\nVoters may ask how their vote can be kept secret if their ballot papers are enclosed in a \ndeclaration vote envelope that shows their name.  \n\nAdvise them that strict procedures are followed for the removal of ballot papers from \ndeclaration envelopes to prevent any name being linked with any ballot paper and that those \nprocedures may be witnessed by scrutineers. \n\nIssuing declaration votes \n\nStep 1 \u2013 Provide the voter with a pen if required. The voter completes sections 1 to 3 on the \ndeclaration vote envelope.   \n\nAsk the voter to print legibly and firmly. \n\nThe issuing officer may assist a voter who has difficulty writing or understanding \nthe process. See page 58 for more information on assisting voters.  \n\nThe issuing officer checks the declaration vote envelope, ensuring that all \nrelevant details have been completed legibly with: \n\nfull name, \n\n\u25aa \n\u25aa  permanent address where the voter normally lives (except silent \n\nelectors), \nformer name (if applicable), \n\n\u25aa \n\u25aa  voter\u2019s address on the electoral roll, if different from the permanent address. This \n\nis the address that you must check in the division finder, and \n\n\u25aa  evidence of identity. Note: this is not compulsory; if the voter cannot provide \n\nevidence of identity, continue to issue the vote. \n\nStep 2 - Use the division finder.  \n\nUsing the voter\u2019s address on the electoral roll, the issuing officer determines the voter\u2019s \ncorrect division in the division finder. \n\nA division finder reference must be recorded on every declaration vote envelope, except in the \ncase of silent electors. For example, the reference is written as 016028 (Page 16, Entry 28).  \n\nWrite the enrolled division on the envelope.  \n\nFor instructions on using a division finder, read the division finder guide on page 100. \n\nStep 3 - Determine the type of declaration vote to be issued. \n\nIf the voter is claiming enrolment for an address in another division within the same state or \nterritory, they are to be issued an absent vote. Ask the voter to sign section 4 of the declaration \nvote envelope then go to step 5. \n\nElection Procedures Handbook \u2013 PPLO/OIC/2IC     Page 51\n\n\n--- Page 53 ---\n\nIf the voter is claiming enrolment at an address in the division of the polling place, they require \na provisional vote. The issuing officer ensures that the certified list has been checked before \nproceeding to issue a provisional vote and then goes to step 4. \n\nStep 4 \u2013 The provisional voting statement. \n\nThe voter must read the provisional voting statement on the back of the declaration envelope. \n\nThe issuing officer may read the statement to the voter if they request assistance. \n\nAsk the voter to sign section 4 of the declaration vote envelope. \n\nStep 5 - Complete the polling official sections.  \n\nThe issuing officer ensures that the polling place name is recorded in the Issued at box and \nsigns AND dates as issuing officer in the \u2018Witnessed by issuing officer\u2019 box. \n\nThe issuing officer ticks the pre-issue check boxes down the right hand side of the envelope \n(pictured) to confirm that the division finder reference has been completed and the voter has \nsigned the declaration vote envelope.   \n\nNote: a declaration vote envelope that is completed in error and is not required should be \ndiscarded. It is not included in the 6pm reconciliation. \n\nStep 6 - Select and initial the correct ballot papers.  \n\nThe issuing officer must select a House of Representatives ballot paper that matches the \ndivision written on the declaration vote envelope and a Senate ballot paper. \n\nThe issuing officer initials the front of each ballot paper within the circle provided.  \n\nThe issuing officer must use their correct initials and does not pre-initial ballot papers.  \n\nStep 7 - Issue the ballot paper and instructions. \n\nThe issuing officer waits until there is a vacant voting screen to hand over the ballot papers. \nThis is important to control voter flow. \n\nNote: The declaration vote envelope must remain with \nthe issuing officer, it is not given to the voter. \n\nThe issuing officer tells the voter: \n\n\u201cFor the House of Representatives, complete the \nballot paper by placing a number one in the box \nnext to the candidate who is your first choice, \nand then number every box in the order of your \nchoice.  \n\nFor the Senate, complete the ballot paper by numbering at least six boxes above the \nline OR by numbering at least twelve boxes below the line, in order of your choice. You \ncan continue numbering as many additional boxes as you choose.  \n\nIf you make a mistake, bring the ballot paper back to me and I will give you another \none.\u201d \n\nElection Procedures Handbook \u2013 PPLO/OIC/2IC     Page 52\n\n\n--- Page 54 ---\n\nNote: issuing officers will be provided with a placecard for their issuing point that includes the \nabove script, so will not have to memorise this. \n\nThe voter should be informed that assistance is available if required and that they must fold \ntheir ballot papers and return them to the same issuing point to be placed in their declaration \nvote envelope. \n\nThe voter can use the pen they have been provided with to complete their ballot papers. \nRemind the voter not to leave anything behind in the voting screen. \n\nStep 8 - While the voter is completing their ballot papers, the issuing officer checks the \ndeclaration envelope. \n\nA.  Has the voter signed the declaration section? Has the issuing officer signed and dated \n\nas witness? \n\nB.  Did the issuing officer use the enrolled address to determine the correct division? \nC.  Did the issuing officer issue ballot papers for the correct division? \n\nStep 9 - File the counterfoil.  \n\nRemove the counterfoil from the envelope. Check that it can be read. If anything on the \ncounterfoil cannot be clearly read, write over the information based on the declaration vote \nenvelope. Do not attempt to copy over the voter\u2019s signature. \n\nFile it in the declaration records counterfoil binder in alphabetical order, first by division and \nthen by family name and given names. \n\nStep 10 - When the voter returns with ballot papers:  \n\n\u25aa \n\n\u25aa \n\n\u25aa \n\nthe issuing officer asks the voter to repeat their name to ensure that their ballot \npapers are placed in the correct declaration vote \nenvelope \nthe issuing officer inserts BOTH ballot papers into the \nenvelope, seals it and places the envelope in the \ndeclaration vote ballot box \nthe voter should be requested to return their pen for \nsanitising and further use \n\n\u25aa  use hand sanitiser at least every 10 voters, alert the \nhygiene officer to regularly wipe down the table and \nchair the voters use. \n\nThe golden rules for declaration vote issuing \n\nAlways use the division finder to determine the correct division. \n\nAlways use the address shown in the Address on Electoral Roll field. Do not use the permanent \naddress unless the voter has confirmed that it is also the enrolled address. \n\nEnsure that the division on the ballot paper matches the division on the declaration vote \nenvelope. \n\nEnsure that the declaration vote envelope is signed by the voter and witnessed and dated by \nthe declaration vote issuing officer. \n\nEnsure that both ballot papers are folded and placed in the declaration envelope. \n\nElection Procedures Handbook \u2013 PPLO/OIC/2IC     Page 53\n\n\n--- Page 55 ---\n\nElectors with address supressed \n\nSilent electors \n\nSilent electors are those electors whose address details do not appear on the certified list. The \nprivacy of a silent elector is to be observed at all times.   \n\nSilent electors are directed to the OIC or 2IC for the issue of a declaration vote. For these \nelectors, follow the declaration vote issuing process except: \n\n\u25aa  do not complete the address sections of the declaration vote envelope. Write \n\n\u2018SILENT\u2019 in the address sections before giving the declaration vote envelope to the \nelector. If the elector enters their address or telephone number, it must be \ncompletely covered with black pen on both the envelope AND the counterfoil so it \ncannot be read, and \n\n\u25aa  ask the elector to identify their division using the division finder \u2013 you must explain \nthe use of the division finder to the silent elector and once they tell you the division \nyou record it on the declaration vote envelope. The division finder reference is not \nrecorded on the declaration vote envelope. \n\nSilent electors must not have their name marked off the certified list. \n\nOther electors with address supressed \n\nOther voters with their address supressed may be itinerant voters (voters who have no fixed \naddress) or designated electors.  \n\nDepending on their situation itinerant electors are enrolled at the address for which they were \nlast eligible to enrol for, at the address of their next of kin, or the division they were born in or \nare most closely connected to. An itinerant elector\u2019s enrolled address will not be shown on the \ncertified list.  An elector whose address is not shown on the certified list must  be referred to \nthe OIC or 2IC who issues them a declaration vote in the same way as a silent elector, except if \nthe elector knows their enrolled address, they can complete the address fields on the \nenvelope. Some voters may only be able to provide a division. In this case the division finder \nreference field is left blank.  \n\nElectors with their address suppressed must not have their name marked off the certified list. \n\nElection Procedures Handbook \u2013 PPLO/OIC/2IC     Page 54\n\n\n--- Page 56 ---\n\nSpoilt or discarded ballot papers \nNote: When processing spoilt or discarded ballot papers, you must use a separate \u2018spoilt or \ndiscarded ballot paper envelope\u2019 for each ballot paper. \n\nSpoilt ballot papers \n\nIf a voter makes a mistake on a ballot paper they can return it to an issuing \nofficer who should:   \n\n\u25aa  cancel the spoilt ballot paper by writing \u2018SPOILT\u2019 on the back \n\u25aa \n\nin full view of the voter, place the spoilt ballot paper in a spoilt or \ndiscarded ballot paper envelope \n\n\u25aa  seal the envelope \n\u25aa  complete the fields on the envelope: \n\n- \n\ntick the type of ballot paper spoilt (House of Representatives or \nSenate), record the division or state/territory as appropriate and \nseal the envelope \ntick the type of voter (ordinary or declaration) \ntick the \u2018Spoilt\u2019 box on the envelope \n\n- \n- \n-  sign as issuing officer \nissue a new ballot paper, remembering to initial it. \n\n\u25aa \n\nIf a voter loses a ballot paper they cannot receive a second one. \n\nKeep spoilt ballot paper envelopes at the issuing point with unused ballot papers, to be \ncounted and reconciled after polling. \n\nDiscarded ballot papers \n\nDuring the day, polling officials or voters may find ballot papers that have been dropped in the \npolling place or left in a voting screen.  \n\nThese must be given to you, they must NOT be put in the ballot box.  They are not included on \nthe certified list coversheet reconciliation or as part of the declaration vote reconciliation. \n\nAs the OIC you will: \n\n\u25aa  write \u2018DISCARDED\u2019 on the back of the ballot paper \n\u25aa  place it in a spoilt or discarded ballot paper envelope \n\u25aa \n\u25aa \n\u25aa \n\ntick the type of voter if known \ntick the \u2018Discarded\u2019 box on the envelope \ntick the type of ballot paper discarded (House of Representatives or Senate) and \nrecord the division or state, as appropriate, and \n\u25aa  seal the spoilt or discarded ballot paper envelope. \n\nYou will count and record discarded ballot paper envelopes after polling. \n\nElection Procedures Handbook \u2013 PPLO/OIC/2IC     Page 55\n\n\n--- Page 57 ---\n\nPostal votes \nSome voters who have applied for a postal vote may wish to:   \n\nlodge their postal vote \n\n\u25aa \n\u25aa  cancel the postal vote and vote in person, or \n\u25aa  advise that they did not receive their postal vote and wish to vote in person. \n\nVoters in these circumstances should be directed to the OIC. \n\nReceiving a completed postal vote \n\nIf a voter wants to lodge their postal vote at your polling place, you should take the completed \npostal vote and: \n\n\u25aa  on the front of the postal vote return envelope (under the return address), write the \nwords \u2018Received by me at [name] polling place\u2019, sign it, and include your position \ntitle, the time and the date of receipt \nrecord the details on the \u2018completed postal votes\u2019 section of the Record of Postal \nVote Certificates form in the OIC return  \n\n\u25aa \n\n\u25aa  place the sealed postal vote envelope in the declaration vote ballot box,. \n\nCancelling a postal vote \n\nIf a voter has been issued with a postal vote but would like to have an ordinary vote at your \npolling place, the postal vote can be cancelled. \n\nYou should take the postal voting material and: \n\n\u25aa  write \u2018CANCELLED\u2019 in large, clear letters on the postal vote return envelope \n\u25aa  place the postal ballot papers and the postal vote certificate in the envelope and \n\n\u25aa \n\nseal it \nrecord the details in the \u2018cancelled postal votes\u2019 section of the Record of Postal \nVote Certificates form in the OIC return, and \n\n\u25aa  place the cancelled postal vote in the declaration vote ballot box. \n\nThe voter can then cast an ordinary or declaration vote as appropriate. \n\nPostal vote not received \n\nPeople should be directed to cast an ordinary or declaration vote as appropriate where they \nadvise they have: \n\n\u25aa  applied for a postal vote but did not receive it \n\u25aa \n\u25aa \n\nreceived and misplaced postal ballot papers, or \nreceived postal ballot papers and filled them out but are unsure if they have \nreturned them to the AEC. \n\nDetails of such cases must be recorded on the \u2018postal votes not received by voters\u2019 section of \nthe Record of postal vote certificates form in the OIC return. \n\nElection Procedures Handbook \u2013 PPLO/OIC/2IC     Page 56\n\n\n--- Page 58 ---\n\nRecording voter information  \n\nElectoral enrolment  \n\nA voter\u2019s enrolment must be updated if their details have changed from those on the certified \nlist in cases where: \n\n\u25aa \n\u25aa \n\u25aa \n\ntheir address has changed \ntheir name has changed, or \ntheir name has been omitted. \n\nIf the voter is directed to complete a declaration vote envelope do not ask them to complete an \nenrolment form \u2013 the envelope will be used to update their details. \n\nFor remaining voters, they should be encouraged to update their details online by scanning the \nQR code provided or visiting aec.gov.au.  \n\nWhere neither of the above options are available, the OIC has a small supply of paper \nenrolment forms and reply paid envelopes. Encourage the voter to fill in their enrolment form \non the spot. \n\n\u25aa \n\nIt must be legible. \n\n\u25aa  They cannot use a postal address for their residential address. \n\n\u25aa  The voter provides evidence of identity (EOI). They can provide a driver\u2019s licence \n\nnumber, passport number or have an enrolled voter confirm their identity and sign \nthe form. \n\n\u25aa  The voter must sign and date the form. \n\n\u25aa  Some states/territories will require a witness to sign the form as well. The form will \n\nmake this obvious.  \n\nMake sure any completed enrolment forms are filed in the completed enrolment forms \nenvelope. \n\nIf the voter is unable to complete the form on the spot, ask them to complete it and post it to \nthe divisional office or update their details via the AEC website. \n\nElector information report \n\nThe elector information report form should be completed when: \n\n\u25aa \n\u25aa \n\u25aa \n\u25aa \n\nthere are errors in the voter\u2019s enrolment details on the certified list \nthe voter\u2019s name is spelt incorrectly \n\nthere are inaccurate address details (such as a wrong house number) \nthe voter\u2019s name is on the certified list twice, or \n\nElection Procedures Handbook \u2013 PPLO/OIC/2IC     Page 57\n\n\n--- Page 59 ---\n\n\u25aa  advice is received about the inability of other people to vote, such as because of \n\nillness, death or other circumstances. \n\nA ballot paper must never be issued to allow a person to vote on \nbehalf of another person.  \n\nAvoid commenting on whether people may be fined for not voting, \nas this will be determined after the election. \n\nNote: the elector information report is not used to change a voter\u2019s \naddress. The electoral enrolment form or declaration vote envelope \nis used for this purpose. \n\nAssisted voting \nA voter who seeks assistance to complete a ballot paper should be directed to the OIC, 2IC, or \ninquiry officer. Issuing officers should not leave their issuing point unattended to assist. \n\nYou should assist a voter if you are satisfied that they require help to vote. Any voter may seek \nhelp, but the following groups have been identified as those most likely to require assistance: \n\nthe elderly \n\n\u25aa \n\u25aa  people with a physical injury or disability that makes it difficult for them to \n\ncomplete a ballot paper \n\n\u25aa  people who are blind or have a vision impairment \n\u25aa  people who are deaf or have a hearing impairment \n\u25aa  people with low literacy \n\u25aa  people from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds. \n\nYou should attempt to identify voters requiring assistance as soon as possible. Use common \nsense to advise electors that there is help available to them should they need assistance. \n\nAssistance to voters  \n\nThe voter can nominate any person (except a candidate) to help them. That person could be a \nfriend or relative, a scrutineer, a party worker or a polling official. If the voter declines to \nnominate someone, you should provide assistance or delegate a polling official to assist the \nvoter. \n\nAssistance by a person nominated by voter \n\nWhere a person nominated by the voter provides assistance: \n\n\u25aa \n\u25aa \n\nthe voter and the nominated assistant enter an unoccupied voting screen, and \nthe nominated assistant helps the voter to complete their vote, which may include \ncompleting, folding and depositing the ballot paper in the ballot box.  \n\nIn this situation, scrutineers are not allowed to enter the voting screen while the ballot paper is \nbeing completed (unless the scrutineer has been nominated as the assistant). \n\nElection Procedures Handbook \u2013 PPLO/OIC/2IC     Page 58\n\n\n--- Page 60 ---\n\nAssistance by a polling official \n\nWhere you or a delegated polling official is assisting a voter, the following rules apply: \n\n\u25aa  one scrutineer from each candidate is entitled to listen to the instructions given by \n\n\u25aa \n\nthe voter and to observe how the ballot paper is completed \nthe voter may provide written instructions on how they want to complete the ballot \npaper (for example, a how-to-vote card). Confirm that the voter is aware of the \ncontents of the written instructions \n\n\u25aa  a witness must be present when the polling official completes the ballot paper. A \n\nscrutineer or, if there is no scrutineer, another polling official or a person \nnominated by the voter may be a witness, and \n\n\u25aa  an interpreter is entitled to be present at all times if the voter needs such help. \n\nTake care not to suggest particular answers or to ask leading questions. \n\nAssistance must be provided to voters if requested. While in this instance it may not be \npossible to maintain a strict 1.5m distance, ensure there is no physical contact, use \nappropriate personal protective equipment such as a face mask, and sanitise hands \nimmediately afterwards. \n\nAssistance to complete a declaration vote envelope  \n\nWhere assistance is being provided to a declaration voter the above instructions apply for \nvoting, but only the delegated polling official should complete the declaration vote envelope. \nThey must: \n\n\u25aa  complete the required details on the declaration vote envelope \n\u25aa \n\nif required, read the details and the provisional voting statement to the voter and \nhave them confirm that the information is correct \nif the voter has a hearing impairment, give them the declaration envelope and \nshow them the provisional voting statement (if required) to read and confirm the \ninformation \n\n\u25aa \n\n\u25aa  have the voter sign the declaration. If they are not able to sign, follow the \n\ninstructions in \u2018voters unable to sign\u2019 below \n\n\u25aa  sign and date in the space provided at \u2018witnessed by issuing officer\u2019, and \n\u25aa  obtain the signature of a witness and their title (for example, \u2018scrutineer\u2019, \u2018polling \n\nofficial\u2019 or \u2018voter\u2019) on a blank area of the envelope. \n\nAssisting voters who are unable to sign \n\nIf a voter is unable to sign, they may make their \u2018mark\u2019 as a signature. The polling official must \nadd the words \u2018his mark,\u2019 or \u2018her mark,\u2019 or \u2018their mark\u2019 above the voter\u2019s mark and print the \nvoter\u2019s given name(s) to the left of the mark, and the voter\u2019s family name to the right of the \nmark. \n\nElection Procedures Handbook \u2013 PPLO/OIC/2IC     Page 59\n\n\n--- Page 61 ---\n\nThe issuing officer must then sign and date as the witness. \n\nA person who holds power of attorney for a voter is NOT permitted to sign the declaration vote \nenvelope on behalf of that voter.  \n\nAssisting voters outside the polling place \n\nA voter may vote outside (but within close proximity to) the polling place if you are satisfied that \nthe voter is unable to enter the polling place because of any condition that prevents them from \nentering the polling place, such as: \n\n\u25aa  physical disability \n\u25aa \n\u25aa  advanced pregnancy. \n\nillness, or \n\nIf the voter can vote without assistance they are entitled to the same privacy as inside the \npolling place. If a voter requires assistance the same \u2018rules\u2019 apply to assistance inside the \npolling place. \n\nThe ballot papers are handed to the polling official who then returns to the polling place and \nplaces them in the ballot box.  \n\nDiscrimination and communication \n\nPeople living with disability \n\nThe Disability Discrimination Act 1992 (the Discrimination Act), which came into effect on \n1 March 1993, makes it unlawful to discriminate on the basis of disability. This Act recognises \nthat people with disability have the same fundamental rights as other people and should have \nequal opportunities to participate in community life. \n\nPeople with disability are no different from any other Australians and have the right to be \ntreated in the same way that you would wish to be treated. \n\n\u25aa  According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, almost one in five Australians \n\nreported as living with disability at the 2016 census. That is 18.3 per cent of the \npopulation, about 4.3 million people. Disability can be: physical \u2013 affecting a \nperson\u2019s mobility or dexterity. \nIntellectual \u2013 affecting a person\u2019s ability to learn. \n\u25aa \n\u25aa  Psychological \u2013 affecting a person\u2019s thinking process. \n\u25aa  Sensory \u2013 affecting a person\u2019s ability to hear or see. \n\u25aa  Neurological \u2013 affecting the person\u2019s brain and central nervous system, or \n\u25aa \n\nImmunological \u2013 the presence of organisms causing disease in the body. \n\nElection Procedures Handbook \u2013 PPLO/OIC/2IC     Page 60\n\n\n--- Page 62 ---\n\nWhen providing electoral services to someone living with disability, always: \n\ntreat adults as adults \ntreat the person as you would any other \n\n\u25aa \n\u25aa \n\u25aa  address the person by their first name only when extending the same familiarity to \n\nall others \n\n\u25aa  speak directly and clearly to the person with disability, including when they are \n\naccompanied by a person without disability \n\n\u25aa  offer assistance if it appears necessary, but don\u2019t assume they will accept it \n\u25aa  ask, if you are unsure about the best way to communicate with the person \n\u25aa  speak clearly, without raising your voice, to assist voters who are deaf or have a \n\nhearing impairment \n\n\u25aa  have writing paper and pens ready. \n\nRemember that people living with disability should not be treated differently. People may \nappreciate understanding, but be intolerant of sympathy or people being condescending. \n\n\u25aa  Do not tell an individual that you admire their courage or determination. \n\u25aa  Never stare at or avoid looking at a physical disability. \n\u25aa  Do not express sympathy for the individual or presume that they are more fragile or \n\nsensitive than others. \n\n\u25aa  Do not assume that someone with a speech or hearing impediment is intellectually \n\nimpaired. \n\n\u25aa  Never feel uncomfortable using the word \u2018see\u2019 when addressing a blind person, or \n\n\u2018hear\u2019 when addressing a hearing impaired person. \n\n\u25aa  Never raise your voice or yell at someone who is having difficulty hearing you. \n\u25aa  Above all, as in any new situation, use common sense, be respectful and \nconsiderate, offer assistance and do not hesitate to ask questions. \n\nPeople from a culturally and linguistically diverse background \n\nWhen providing electoral services to voters from culturally and linguistically diverse \nbackgrounds, it is important to have patience, understanding and a supportive attitude. \n\nShow consideration for all voters: \n\n\u25aa  be aware that cultural differences exist; for example, in some situations it is \n\nconsidered more appropriate for women to be served by women \n\n\u25aa  some voters may mistrust and/or be suspicious of government processes \n\u25aa  some voters may be nervous about their English proficiency. \n\nIf a voter shows confusion or concern in being directed to a declaration issuing point, take time \nto carefully explain the process to them. \n\nBe aware of multilingual staff employed at the polling place and the languages they speak, so \nthat you can refer voters from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds to them if \nnecessary.  OICs should ask the staff at the morning briefing if anyone is fluent in another \nlanguage and happy to support multilingual voters who may speak the same language. \n\nWhere voters indicate a need for assistance in completing forms or papers provided, polling \nstaff should offer to assist accordingly.  \n\nElection Procedures Handbook \u2013 PPLO/OIC/2IC     Page 61\n\n\n--- Page 63 ---\n\nWhere multilingual staff are not available, the following points may assist with communication \nin English: \n\n\u25aa  speak slower than normal and as clearly as possible \n\u25aa  do not raise your voice \n\u25aa  do not be patronising \n\u25aa  ask whether there is someone with the voter who can help \n\u25aa  simplify your language by using smaller words or phrases such as \u2018Where do you \n\nlive?\u2019 \nif necessary, use hand gestures or simple drawings to support what you are saying \n\n\u25aa \n\n\u25aa  ask the voter to write down their name to help you to find it on the certified list (if \n\napplicable) \n\n\u25aa  ask the voter whether they have some form of identification with their name and \n\naddress on it (if applicable), and \n\n\u25aa  use the How to vote guide. \n\nPreparing for the close of polling \nThe OIC return includes a list of tasks that should be completed to prepare for closing the \npolling place.  \n\nDepending on the size of the polling place and how busy you are, during the latter part of the \nafternoon you may arrange to dismantle some voting screens and close down some issuing \npoints. The dismantled voting screens should be stacked ready for collection. At least one \nordinary and one declaration point must remain open until the close of polling. \n\nMake sure that you and your staff take the opportunity to vote before 6pm. \n\nScrutiny assistants \n\nScrutiny assistants should arrive by 5pm. As they arrive, brief them on their duties (which \ninclude dismantling voting screens, tidying the premises and preparing materials for post 6pm \nactivities) and ensure that they sign the attendance record and their proof of COVID-19 \nvaccination status is sighted.  Scrutiny assistants can also be used to replace queue \ncontrollers and ballot box guards while they have a break.   \n\nAfter 6pm they will also be required to assist with the scrutiny and count of ballot papers and \nother duties as directed by you. One scrutiny assistant per polling place will also be identified \nby the DRO to return materials on behalf of the OIC once the polling place is packed up. \n\nElection Procedures Handbook \u2013 PPLO/OIC/2IC     Page 62\n\n\n--- Page 64 ---\n\nClose of polls \n\nJust before 6pm, check the time so that your polling place closes at exactly 6pm. Visiting \nhttps://time.is/ will provide the accurate time. \n\nHave a second person (preferably a scrutineer) witness the time check and confirm the time of \nclosure of the polling place by signing the Polling place declaration in the OIC return. When the \ndoors of the polling place are closed at 6pm sharp, any person still in the polling place has a \nright to vote. If there is a queue and it is not possible for all voters to be in the polling place, a \npolling official should join the end of the queue at 6pm sharp and no other person should be \nallowed to join the queue or vote. \n\nElection Procedures Handbook \u2013 PPLO/OIC/2IC     Page 63\n\n\n--- Page 65 ---\n\nAfter polling \n\nPreparation for scrutiny \nSection A of the OIC return provides a guide to the \ntasks to complete once all voters have left the polling \nplace and the doors are locked.  \n\nOrdinary issuing staff must complete their ballot paper \nreconciliation before helping with the scrutiny.  \n\nDeclaration vote issuing staff must complete their \nballot paper reconciliation and declaration vote \nenvelope reconciliation before helping with the \nscrutiny of ordinary votes. \n\nIf the premises has more than one division operating at it, each OIC will run a separate scrutiny \nof ordinary votes with their allocated staff (unless otherwise instructed,).  \nBallot papers from the different divisions must be kept separate at all times.  \n\nThe first preference and two candidate preferred (TCP) counts will need to be set up and \nconducted so that 1.5m distancing is maintained as much as possible.   \n\nThe following measures are to be in place during the scrutiny: \n\n\u25aa  where possible, staff to work on individual tables and remain 1.5m apart \n\u25aa  where possible, staff can be seated \n\u25aa  use the sanitising spray to wipe the tables before and after the scrutiny \n\u25aa  use the sanitising spray to wipe the ballot box (including the seals) before opening \n\nafter 6pm. Always spray onto the towel rather than the election material \n\n\u25aa  hand sanitiser to be readily available \n\u25aa  staff to sanitise their hands at the start and end of the count, and regularly during \n\n\u25aa \n\nthe count including when ballot papers are moved between tables, and \nif 1.5m physical distancing cannot be maintained, masks should be worn, including \nby scrutineers. \n\nBefore 6pm \n\nTo assist in the preparation of the scrutiny, during the afternoon of polling make sure that staff \nhave been assigned specific tasks for the scrutiny and they understand how to carry out these \ntasks. Sort cards and packaging labels can also be prepared before 6pm. \n\nStaff and scrutineers \n\nBriefing \n\nYou are in control of the scrutiny and must therefore explain the order of tasks to be carried \nout to polling officials and scrutineers before beginning the scrutinies. The OIC return assists in \ndelivering the briefing. \n\nPage 64    Election Procedures Handbook \u2013 PPLO/OIC/2IC\n\n\n--- Page 66 ---\n\nScrutineers during the count \n\nEntitlement \n\nFor guidelines on eligibility and appointment of scrutineers please see \u2018Candidates, party \nworkers and scrutineers on page 87.  \n\nAs OIC, you will be the point of contact for scrutineers during the count. You must check \nappointment forms when scrutineers arrive and issue identification badges. You will need to \nexercise discretion to ensure that reasonable requests by scrutineers are met, while not \nunduly delaying election results from your polling place. \n\nIn a polling place with more than one division operating, scrutineers are only entitled to \nmonitor activities for the division for which they were appointed.  \n\nRights and responsibilities \n\nAll proceedings at the scrutiny are open to inspection by scrutineers and they can inspect any \nballot paper without touching it. \n\nScrutineers may enter and leave the polling place at any time during the scrutiny provided they \nhave shown you a completed appointment form. \n\nScrutineers must not: \n\nremain in a polling place without a scrutineer\u2019s badge \ntouch ballot papers \n\n\u25aa \n\u25aa \n\u25aa  help with clearing voting screens or the removal of material from the polling place, \n\nor \n\n\u25aa  unreasonably delay or interfere in the progress of the scrutiny of votes. \n\nWhen a scrutineer leaves the polling place, they must return their badge. \n\nObjections to ballot papers \n\nIf a scrutineer objects to the formality of a House of Representatives ballot paper, it should be \nset aside for you to examine. \n\nAfter examining the ballot paper and making a determination on its formality, you must write \non the back of the ballot paper \u2018ADMITTED\u2019 or \u2018REJECTED\u2019 according to your decision, and add \nyour initials and the date. The ballot paper is then sorted to the candidate if admitted or to \ninformal if rejected. \n\nElection Procedures Handbook \u2013 PPLO/OIC/2IC     Page 65\n\n\n--- Page 67 ---\n\nDecisions on the formality of Senate ballot papers are not made at the polling place. This \nmeans that scrutineers cannot object to the formality of Senate ballot papers at a polling \nplace. Scrutineers will have the opportunity to object to the formality of Senate ballot papers at \nthe Central Senate Scrutiny conducted under the authority of the Australian Electoral Officer \nfor each state/territory. \n\nWork area \n\nThe following diagrams show key principles to follow when setting up the work area. Please \nnote: \n\n\u25aa  As a principle, unfolding is marginally faster than sorting so you should have \nslightly more staff sorting than unfolding. If sorting staff are being starved of \nunfolded ballot papers in the production line, they can be allocated a small bundle \nof ballot papers to unfold and then sort on their individual table. \n\n\u25aa  To minimise cross over of staff, sorters should generally stay seated and the \n\nunfolder/runners move the ballot papers as required. This includes assisting the \nOIC to allocate bundles of ballot papers ready to be counted/check counted, and \n\n\u25aa  Unfolder/runners can also assist with counting ballot papers if required. \n\nAfter 6pm \n\nAfter 6pm on polling day, instruct any staff not involved in the collection and reconciliation of \nmaterial, or the reconciliation of declaration votes, to dismantle remaining cardboard polling \nequipment and set up all tables needed for the scrutiny (if not already done). \n\nYou need to organise your available space so that you have room for: \n\n1.  House of Representatives area for unfolding and sorting/counting \n2.  Senate area for unfolding and sorting/counting (this can progressively get bigger as the \n\nHouse of Representatives scrutiny finishes) \n3.  completion of returns and other paperwork, and \n4.  packaging of election materials. \n\nElection Procedures Handbook \u2013 PPLO/OIC/2IC     Page 66\n\n\n--- Page 68 ---\n\nElection Procedures Handbook \u2013 PPLO/OIC/2IC     Page 67\n\n\n--- Page 69 ---\n\nReconciliation of material \n\nBefore you begin the scrutiny, instruct ordinary and declaration vote issuing officers on the \nprocedures for reconciling material and returning it to you, keeping each issuing point\u2019s \nmaterial separate. Only after reconciling at issuing point level and recording on the relevant \nworksheets and forms, may material be merged. If there is a 2IC, they should coordinate the \nreconciliation of declaration voting material.  \n\nAs material is returned to you, arrange it ready for packaging. More information is provided on \npage 79. \n\nReconciliation of ordinary votes \n\nOrdinary issuing officers should be instructed to count all unused ballot papers and complete \nthe Certified list coversheet fields by tallying total ballot papers received, spoilt, unused and \nthen issued. \n\nReconciliation of declaration votes \n\nAt 6pm the declaration vote ballot boxes are opened and each declaration vote issuing officer \nis to check and reconcile ballot papers, counterfoils, and declaration envelopes on the Ballot \npaper tracking form.  \n\nGive each declaration vote issuing officer an \u2018After 6pm checklist for staff reconciling \ndeclaration votes\u2019 found in your OIC return to help with this task. Every declaration vote issuing \npoint must be reconciled separately. \n\nThe number of envelopes for each division should match \nthe ballot paper reconciliation for votes issued as well as \nmatch the counterfoils.  \n\n\u25aa  Counterfoils should have been sorted \n\nprogressively throughout polling day into \nalphabetical order, first by division, then by voter\u2019s \nfamily name and then given name. \n\n\u25aa \n\nIf there is more than one declaration vote issuing \npoint, after reconciling the issuing points \nseparately, all counterfoils must be merged and sorted alphabetically by family name \nfor each division and filed in the declaration vote counterfoil folder(s). \n\n\u25aa  Declaration envelopes from all issuing points must then be merged and sorted \n\nalphabetically, first by division, then by family name and bundled behind a completed \nDeclaration vote packaging card (EF097) for each division. \n\n\u25aa  The bundles of declaration votes, counterfoil binders and any postal votes extracted \n\nearlier are to be packaged for return of materials. The same plastic ballot box(es) used \nfor declaration voting will be used for this purpose. If envelopes/counterfoils don't \nreconcile, the declaration vote issuing officer should alert the OIC who should record \nthe details in their OIC return. \n\nElection Procedures Handbook \u2013 PPLO/OIC/2IC     Page 68\n\n\n--- Page 70 ---\n\nOrder of the scrutinies/counts \n\nBallot papers must be counted in the following order: \n\n1.  House of Representatives \u2013 first preference \n2.  House of Representatives \u2013 two candidate preferred (TCP), and \n3.  Senate. \n\nYou must phone the results through separately to the election night results team as soon as \npossible after each count has been completed.   \n\nWhen counting one type of ballot paper, it is essential that the other types are kept separate \nand secure. However, the opening of the Senate ballot boxes and unfolding of all Senate ballot \npapers should occur before the completion of the count of the House of Representatives, to \ncheck for ballot papers that may have been put in the wrong ballot boxes. \n\nHouse of Representatives Scrutiny and Senate Count \n\nScrutinies/counts are conducted using a production\u2013line system that has three main tasks: \n\n1.  unfolding \n2.  sorting, and \n3.  counting. \n\nThe sorting phase is the most time consuming \ncomponent and can become congested \ndepending on the space available. It is \nrecommended that once a small number of ballot \npapers have been unfolded, gradually move \nsome staff to sorting and then counting to form a \nproduction line. If some staff seem slower at \nsorting ballot papers than others, swap them to a \ndifferent task if possible. \n\nThe areas should be set up so that any \nscrutineers have full access to observe and \nrecord the results of the count. \n\nOpening the ordinary ballot boxes  \n\nNote: Ensure that there are no voters in the polling place when a ballot box is opened. \n\nWash hands or use hand sanitiser before and after handling security seals. \n\nBefore you open a ballot box you must check the seals in the presence of polling officials and \nscrutineers.  \n\nYou, as the OIC and a witness must sign the Record of ballot boxes and security seals in the \nOIC return.  \n\nSort cards \n\nThe sorting area should be set up making sure:  \n\n\u25aa \n\n\u25aa \n\nthere is a sort card for each candidate or group as appropriate for House of \nRepresentatives or Senate ballot papers, and \nthere is a sort card for informal ballot papers and for \u2018queries\u2019 for you to examine if \na scrutineer has objected to a ballot paper.  \n\nElection Procedures Handbook \u2013 PPLO/OIC/2IC     Page 69\n\n\n--- Page 71 ---\n\nSort cards should be placed along the table in the same order as the candidates/groups \nappear on the ballot paper. \n\nBallot paper formality \n\nThere are principles and guidelines that must be followed when deciding if a ballot paper is \nformal and can therefore be counted.  Please read the Ballot Paper Formality guide starting on \npage 102. \n\nHouse of Representatives scrutiny procedure \nFollowing the close of poll, the counting of ballot papers must be undertaken using the \nfollowing process and taking account of physical distancing requirements.  \n\nSort cards should be laid out on individual sort tables in order of the candidate names on the \nballot paper. Then: \n\nUnfolding \n\n\u25aa  Empty ballot box onto initial table. \n\u25aa  Unfolder/runner takes ballot papers from initial table, unfolds at their individual \n\ntable into neat piles. Sorters can also be allocated a small bundle of ballot papers \ninitially to unfold to get started. \n\n\u25aa  As piles of unfolded ballot papers are generated, unfolder/runner delivers to any of \n\nthe sort tables.  \n\nSorting \n\n\u25aa  Allocated staff will sort ballot papers on their individual tables to sort cards. Raise \nhand for unfolder/runner to deliver more unfolded ballot papers as required. \nIf any ballot papers are being challenged by scrutineers, the unfolder/runners can \nperiodically take them from the sort tables to the central table for the OIC to \nreview. \n\n\u25aa \n\nOnce a staff member has sorted all available ballot papers, the staff member should raise \nhand for unfolder/runner to collect ballot papers and place them on central table. When \nsorting ballot papers, make sure that:  \n\n\u25aa  each ballot paper is examined for formality \n\u25aa  ballot papers are sorted and placed in piles according to first preferences by \n\n\u25aa \n\n\u25aa \n\ncandidate \ninformal ballot papers are placed in a separate pile to one side for you to check, \nthis includes ballot papers where staff are unsure as to the formality \nif the formality of a ballot paper is objected to by a scrutineer, the ballot paper \nshould be placed in a \u2018queries\u2019 pile for you to check and determine whether they \nare formal or informal. You must write on the back of the ballot paper \u2018admitted\u2019 or \n\u2018rejected\u2019 and add your initials and the date, \n\nElection Procedures Handbook \u2013 PPLO/OIC/2IC     Page 70\n\n\n--- Page 72 ---\n\n\u25aa  ballot papers for other divisions are placed on the queries pile. \n\n\u2022  ballot papers for guest divisions (i.e. ordinary votes) are admissible and \n\nshould be collated with a clearly marked sort card for transfer to the correct \ncount. If occurring on-site, this can be given to the relevant supervisor. If \nnot, the ballot papers should be parcelled, details recorded on the \nDiscrepancies form in the OIC return, packaged with other House of \nRepresentatives ballot papers, and returned with other materials to the OPC \n\n\u2022  ballot papers for divisions who were not guests in the polling place are \n\ninformal \n\nCounting \n\n\u25aa  Once all ballot papers are placed on central table, OIC allocates individual \n\ncandidate piles back to sorters to count. Unfolder/runners to assist with moving \nballot papers. OIC will need to consider size of piles and potentially split the major \ncandidates across multiple tables to count. Unfolder/runners can also be allocated \nballot papers to count at their individual tables. \n\n\u25aa  As the ballot papers are being counted the polling official is re-checking that the \n\nnumber \u20181\u2019 is for the correct candidate.  \n\n\u25aa  Formal ballot papers for each candidate are counted into bundles of 50 then \n\nsecured with a rubber band. It is recommended counting into 5 piles of 10 ballot \npapers, then combining the piles to make a bundle of 50.  \nAny bundle with less than 50 should have the amount recorded on a post-it note \nwhich is stuck to the top of the bundle and secured with a rubber band. Raise hand \nto notify OIC.  \n\n\u25aa  Unfolder/runners or OIC return ballot papers to central table. OIC then allocates to \na different staff member to check count each candidate. (Note: staff to raise hand \nduring counting if any mis-sorts are identified so that the runner can reallocate to \nthe correct candidate/informal). \n\n\u25aa  Whilst ballot papers are being counted, the OIC can check the informal pile and \n\nreview any remaining queried ballot papers. \n\nElection Procedures Handbook \u2013 PPLO/OIC/2IC     Page 71\n\n\n--- Page 73 ---\n\n\u25aa  Once check counted, staff raise hand to notify OIC. Unfolder/runners assist with \n\nreturning ballot papers to central table where OIC writes the total number of ballot \npapers on the sort card which is placed on the top bundle and secured with a \nfurther rubber band around all bundles for that candidate. \nInformal ballot papers are then counted and bundled the same way as the formal \nballot papers. \n\n\u25aa \n\nDo not write on ballot papers (except to note \u2018Rejected\u2019 or \u2018Admitted\u2019 on the back of ballot \npapers that were challenged by a scrutineer). Use rubber bands to bundle House of \nRepresentatives ballot papers \u2013 do not fold or roll ballot papers. \n\nYou may find that not all staff are utilised once you get to the counting phase. Progressively \nmove staff from the House of Representatives scrutiny to the Senate count once they have \ncompleted. \n\nRecording results \n\nWhen counting is finished the OIC records the number of first preference votes for each \ncandidate and the number of informal ballot papers on the Result of count - House of \nRepresentatives sheet in the OIC return. \n\nReconciliation \n\nYou must check that the total count of ordinary ballot papers agrees with the number of ballot \npapers issued on the House of Representatives \u2013 Worksheet form in the OIC return. \n\nIf the total number of formal, informal, spoilt, and unused ordinary ballot papers is less than \nthe number issued, staff should check to see whether any ballot papers have been overlooked. \n\nYou should check all ballot boxes and conduct a general check of the premises. \n\nDo not check bins, due to potential risks from discarded objects. \n\nIf necessary, do one recount. If there is still a small difference, it may be due to voters not \nplacing both their ballot papers in the ballot boxes.  \n\nBalancing errors commonly occur because of: \n\ninaccurate counting of ballot papers before polling \n\u25aa \n\u25aa  a miscount of unused ballot papers at the end of polling \n\u25aa  ordinary votes placed in incorrect division\u2019s ballot box (if a dual or multi) \nincluding discarded declaration ballot papers in the total figures, or \n\u25aa \n\u25aa  not including the OIC\u2019s unallocated ballot papers in the total number of unused \n\npapers in the ballot paper reconciliation. \n\nDo not take any more time by searching or recounting again. This will delay the release of \nresults. \n\nWhen satisfied with the figures the details are to be recorded on the House of Representatives \nworksheet form in the OIC return. \n\nElection Procedures Handbook \u2013 PPLO/OIC/2IC     Page 72\n\n\n--- Page 74 ---\n\nTelephoning results \n\nA dedicated phone number for results will have been provided in your OIC return. You will need \nto provide your name, polling place name and OIC Identification. The OIC Identification is \nprovided in the TCP envelope in the OIC return. \n\nYou must make three separate phone calls in total to the divisional office; one at the \nconclusion of each count. Phone in the results of each count as soon as possible. \n\nDo not end the phone call until told to do so by divisional staff.  \n\nIf there is no phone or mobile phone coverage inside the polling place, you must remain in the \nroom and have another polling official make the phone call. \n\nTwo candidate preferred scrutiny procedure \n\nIntroduction \n\nThe two candidate preferred (TCP) scrutiny takes place in all polling places where more than \ntwo candidates are contesting the election on the House of Representatives ballot papers. The \nAEC selects two \u2018major\u2019 candidates and provides you with their names in a sealed envelope \nwhich is not to be opened prior to 6pm. This envelope will be included with the OIC return. \n\nPreferences from the ballot papers for all other \u2018minor\u2019 candidates are distributed between the \ntwo major candidates. \n\nThe TCP count should be performed by you and/or the 2IC, and if necessary another polling \nofficial selected by yourself. It takes place after the first preferences of all House of \nRepresentatives ballot papers have been counted and phoned in. \n\nThe TCP count provides an indication of the likely outcome of the poll in that division. \n\nAll staff not involved in the TCP should be moved on to the \nSenate count. \n\nProcedure \n\nAt the completion of the House of Representatives scrutiny \nof  first  preference  votes  the  TCP  scrutiny  should  be \nconducted  by  the  OIC/2IC  at  the  central  table.  In  larger \npolling places the second officer involved in the scrutiny can \nassist from a separate table. \n The process is as follows: \n\n1.  Set aside the first preference ballot papers for the two candidates selected by the AEO \nas being the most likely to be elected and the informal ballot papers. These ballot \npapers are not touched as part of the TCP count. The ballot papers from other \ncandidates are not amalgamated with these ballot papers at any time.  \n\n2.  Choose a remaining candidate and sort ballot papers to the selected candidates. To \n\ndetermine the correct candidate to sort the ballot papers to: \n\na.  examine the preference marks against the two selected candidates to \n\ndetermine which is more preferred. The candidate that is more preferred will be \nrepresented by the number closest to 1, i.e. 2 is more preferred than 5. \n\nb.  Sort the ballot papers to the more preferred candidate. \n\nElection Procedures Handbook \u2013 PPLO/OIC/2IC     Page 73\n\n\n--- Page 75 ---\n\n3.  Count the number of ballot papers allocated to each selected candidate and record the \n\nresult on the TCP worksheet. \n\n4.  Return the ballot papers to their original first preference bundles, sorting back to piles \n\nof 50. \n\nRepeat this process for all candidates other than the two selected candidates. \n\nTCP preference examples \n\nIn the following examples, Peters and Mathews have been selected as the major candidates. \nThe following ballot papers were sorted to minor candidates and will be sorted to the major \ncandidates as described: \n\nExample 1: Mathews is the more preferred candidate, as the voter has given fourth preference \nto Mathews, whereas Peters is fifth preference. The paper is sorted to Mathews. \n\nExample 2: Peters is the more preferred candidate, as the voter has given third preference to \nPeters, whereas Mathews is fifth preference.  The paper is sorted to Peters.  \n\nExample 3: Peters is the more preferred candidate, as the voter has given Peters second \npreference before third preference to Mathews.  The paper is sorted to Peters. \n\n1) \n\n  2) \n\n  3) \n\nRecording results \n\nRecord the TCP figures on the Result of Count \u2013 two candidate preferred worksheet in the OIC \nreturn. \n\nFor each minor candidate, ensure that: \n\n\u25aa \n\u25aa \n\ntheir preferences are counted to one of the major candidates, and \nthe total number of votes distributed to major candidates agrees with the total \nnumber of votes recorded for the minor candidate. \n\nElection Procedures Handbook \u2013 PPLO/OIC/2IC     Page 74\n\n\n--- Page 76 ---\n\nThe ballot papers for each minor candidate are then placed back with their original sort card \n(1st preference sort) in rubber banded bundles of 50. \n\nDo not amalgamate these ballot papers with those of other candidates \u2013 keep them bundled \nseparately by first preference for each candidate. \n\nContinue these steps until all the minor candidates have had their preferences counted. \n\nEnsure that the figure shown in the TCP total column agrees with the \u2018Total 1st preference\u2019 \nrecorded on the Result of Count - House of Representatives sheet. \n\nTelephoning results \n\nOnce the totals are recorded, phone the results through to the divisional office immediately, do \nnot wait for all three scrutinies to be complete. \n\nYou will be required to provide your name, polling place name and OIC identification when you \nphone in your results. \n\nSenate count \nThe count of Senate ballot papers carried out at polling places is not considered a scrutiny. \nThis means that at the polling place you do not make decisions on the formality of Senate \nballot papers. You will, however, need to separate out the obviously informal ballot papers \nwhich cannot be allocated to any group because they are blank, indicate more than one first \npreference or do not indicate a first preference for any candidate. The scrutiny of Senate ballot \npapers is undertaken at the Central Senate Scrutiny (CSS) centre in the weeks following polling \nday. Scrutineers have the opportunity to challenge the formality of Senate ballot papers at the \nCSS. \n\nPolling officials are doing a preliminary count by first preference. Only those ballot papers that \nare obviously informal (i.e., no first preference or more than one first preference) will be \nincluded in the informal pile. \n\nElection Procedures Handbook \u2013 PPLO/OIC/2IC     Page 75\n\n\n--- Page 77 ---\n\nThe Senate ballot paper consists of two sections \u2013 above the line and below the line (see \nfigure below). The boxes above the line represent the group of candidates listed vertically \nbelow the line. Electors can vote above the line for groups (whether these group boxes are \nendorsed and thus labelled with a party name or not); or for individual candidates below the \nline.  \n\nWhen preparing for the count, sort cards should be laid out for the four major groups above \nthe line, one card for the remaining above the line groups, and one card for all votes below the \nline on sorting tables. Then there should be central tables for each of the four major groups. \nThe procedure for the Senate count is as follows: \n\nUnfolding \n\n\u25aa  Empty ballot box onto initial table. \n\u25aa  Unfolder/runner takes ballot papers from initial table, unfolds at their individual table \ninto neat piles. Sorters can also be allocated a small bundle of ballot papers initially to \nunfold to get started. \n\n\u25aa  As piles of unfolded ballot papers are generated, unfolder/runner delivers to any of the \n\nsort tables.  \n\nSorting \n\n\u25aa  Sorters sort ballot papers at \n\ntheir individual tables according \nto the first preferences shown \nfor each group. It is quicker to \ninitially sort to these top three or \nfour groups and place all other \nATL votes in a separate pile, as \nwell as a separate pile for BTL \nand informal. Any ballot papers \nmarked both ATL and BTL \nshould be sorted to the BTL pile. \nRaise hand for unfolder/runner \nto deliver more unfolded ballot \npapers as required. \n\n\u25aa  Once a sorter has completed all \nballot papers, raise hand for \nunfolder/runner to collect ballot \npapers and place them on \ncentral sort table. \n\nElection Procedures Handbook \u2013 PPLO/OIC/2IC     Page 76\n\n\n--- Page 78 ---\n\n\u25aa  The first four piles can then be transferred to individuals to count (below) while a small \ngroup of sorters can then progressively be moved to sort the \u2018ATL Other\u2019 pile. Use sort \ncards across a number of tables, sorters will need to move around and place the ballot \npapers with their sort cards in group order. \n\n\u25aa  Note: Sort cards should be marked with the letter(s) that represent that group on the \nballot paper, for instance A, B, C etc., as it is easier to sort to the letter(s) than to the \ngroup party name. \n\n\u25aa  The BTL votes are then to be sorted to their Group, i.e., a first preference for any BTL \ncandidate under Group C will be sorted to Group C. Ungrouped candidates are to be \nsorted to individual candidates. \n\nSort to piles next to the ATL piles (do not merge ATL with BTL) and to separate piles for any \nungrouped candidates.  \n\nCounting \n\n\u25aa  Once all ballot papers are placed on central table, OIC allocates individual piles back to \nsorters to count. Unfolder/runners assist with moving ballot papers. OIC will need to \nconsider size of piles and potentially split the major candidates across multiple tables \nto count. Unfolder/runners can also be allocated ballot papers to count at their \nindividual tables. \n\n\u25aa  To count the ballot papers, individuals should place them face up so that the first \n\npreference can be checked as you count. \n\n\u25aa  Count the ballot papers into bundles of 50 and secure with a foldback (or bulldog) clip. \nAny bundle with less than 50 ballot papers should be identified by writing the number \nof ballot papers on a post-it note, and sticking it to the top of the bundle, then securing \nthe bundle with a foldback clip. (Note: staff to raise hand during counting if any mis-\nsorts are identified so that the runner can reallocate to the correct \ncandidate/informal). \n\n\u25aa  The counter should then raise hand to notify OIC. Unfolder/runners or OIC return ballot \n\npapers to central table.  \n\n\u25aa  Do not fold or roll ballot papers. \n\u25aa  The OIC will then write the number of ballot papers for each group on the sort card and \nsecure the card with the foldback clip on the top bundle.  Do not write on ballot papers. \n\u25aa  Record each total first preference vote for each group on the Result of count \u2013 Senate \n\nworksheet in the OIC return.  \n\n\u25aa  Whilst ballot papers are being counted, the OIC can check the informal pile and deal \n\nwith any remaining queried ballot papers. \n\n\u25aa  Unfolder/runners assist with returning ballot papers to central table where OIC \ncompletes sort cards and records first preference results on the results slip. \n\n\u25aa  Once all ballot papers, including informals, have been counted, and totals recorded on \nthe Senate Result of count phone-in slip, BTL ballot papers should be merged into one \nbundle and packaged as \u201cBTL\u201d.  \n\nElection Procedures Handbook \u2013 PPLO/OIC/2IC     Page 77\n\n\n--- Page 79 ---\n\n1.  Use a new sort card labelled \u201cBTL\u201d.  \n2.  Merge all BTL bundles into one, make new bundles of 50 from any bundles that did \n\nnot add up to 50 in the sort (for example if you had 20 ballot papers in a bundle from \nGroup A and 30 in a bundle for Group D, merge these together). Ensure all post-it \nnotes are removed except if there is one remaining bundle that has less than 50 ballot \npapers.  \n\n3.  Record the total number of BTL \n\nvotes for the polling place on the \nsort card and secure it with the \nfoldback clip to the top bundle. \n\nUnused Senate ballot papers \n\nUnused ballot papers that are still in bundles of 100 from the original allocation do not need to \nbe re-bundled after polling. \n\nAll other unused Senate ballot papers are to be counted into bundles of 50, with any \nremainders on top with the number recorded on a post-it note. Foldback clips should be used \nto secure bundles. Do not fold or roll ballot papers. \n\nWrite the total number of unused ballot papers on a sort card labelled \u201cUnused\u201d and secure \nthe card to the top bundle with the foldback clip.  \n\nTelephoning results \n\nOnce you are satisfied with the calculations on the Senate Result of count phone-in slip, phone \nthese totals through to the divisional office. You will be asked to provide your name, polling \nplace name and OIC Identification. \n\nOnce results are phoned through the ballot papers and remaining election materials need to \nbe parcelled and packaged ready for return of materials to the hub/out-posted centre. That \nprocess is covered in Packaging election materials, see page 79.  \n\nFinal duties \nAs staff finish their scrutiny duties, they should help with the following: \n\n\u25aa  dismantling any remaining polling place equipment \n\u25aa \n\u25aa \n\u25aa \n\u25aa  making sure that premises are left tidy and in the condition agreed to when the \n\nremoving any remaining signs or posters \ninspecting the premises to make sure no election material has been overlooked \nreturning furniture to its proper place, and \n\nbuilding was hired. \n\nElection Procedures Handbook \u2013 PPLO/OIC/2IC     Page 78\n\n\n--- Page 80 ---\n\nNo staff should leave until all packaging and tidying is complete. \n\nYou are responsible for returning premises keys according to the agreed arrangements. \n\nOIC returns \n\nOnce you have completed your last day of polling you must complete your OIC return, see page \n28 for details on completing the return. \n\nOnce completed the OIC return is packaged with the materials that are returned as instructed  \n\nPacking election materials \n\nIntroduction \n\nYou will be provided with plastic bags, labels, tamper evident tape and various other packaging \nmaterials.  \n\nMaterial is to be packaged using these supplies and in accordance with packaging \ninstructions.  The Parcelling and packaging quick reference guide handout can be provided to \nstaff to assist. \n\nYou must comply with these instructions. Failure to do so may result in staff re-packaging \nmaterial at the designated delivery point. \n\nReturning materials \n\nRemember to follow specific instructions issued in the Preparation Guide for the return of all \nmaterials. \n\nUnless otherwise directed OICs will transfer custody of all material to the designated Scrutiny \nAssistant for return to the location as instructed. \n\nElection material must be securely transported inside an enclosed vehicle (improvised \nenclosures such as tarpaulins over open tray utilities are not permitted), and supervised at all \ntimes. \n\nIf the material is to be returned by a courier, all materials must be collected by the approved \ncourier with consignment labels attached to all packages being returned. \n\nElection Procedures Handbook \u2013 PPLO/OIC/2IC     Page 79\n\n\n--- Page 81 ---\n\nPreparation \n\nFollowing polling you should set aside an area for packaging of materials.  This area needs to \nbe large enough for you to lay out all labels and bags side by side. When you have finished with \nany particular item, place it next to the label that has that item listed on it. At the end of the \nnight, it should then be a simple exercise to place the materials into the bag or transport \ncontainer with the appropriate label. \n\nNo rubbish or recycling should be placed near ballot papers and materials to be packaged. \n\nApproved labels for polling material \n\nOnly approved labels may be used for packaging of election materials.  \n\nEach label describes the contents of the parcel or package. Strict attention is to be paid to \nensure the correct material is placed with the right labels. \n\nRecord the polling place name on every label if it\u2019s not already printed on there and ensure you \ncomplete any necessary information on the label and sign it. \n\nLabel 1 \u2013 Administration records \n\nLabel 1 package should be the last to be sealed (with tamper evident tape). It must include the \nOIC return as well as the polling place attendance record, which must be signed by all polling \nstaff. \n\nEnsure that the OIC return has been completed accurately and that it has been signed and \nwitnessed as required. \n\nLabel 2 \u2013 Declaration vote materials  \n\nLabel 2 package must contain the completed Absent and provisional vote envelopes, \ndeclaration counterfoils in the red counterfoil folder(s), completed postal votes and cancelled \npostal votes. The plastic declaration ballot box(es) are to be used as the secure containers for \npackaging declaration vote materials.  \n\nContainers must be sealed with plastic seals and the \nRecord of security seals form completed. Complete the \nlabel and place it in the container window. \n\nOnly folders containing counterfoils should be packaged \nin Label 2. Once counterfoils have been merged, any \nempty folders should be packaged with Label 8. \n\nLabel 3 \u2013 Enrolment \n\nLabel 3 package must contain all elector information reports, the envelope containing \ncompleted enrolment forms and scrutineer appointment forms and be sealed with tamper \nevident tape. \n\nLabel 4 \u2013 Certified lists \n\nWhen completing Label 4 ensure you include the number of certified lists that have been \nincluded in the package, then seal with tamper evident tape. \n\nElection Procedures Handbook \u2013 PPLO/OIC/2IC     Page 80\n\n\n--- Page 82 ---\n\nLabel 5 \u2013 House of Representatives ballot paper stubs parcel  \n\nLabel 5 is used for House of Representatives ballot paper stubs. The ballot paper stubs must \nbe placed in an individual parcel, labelled with Label 5 and sealed with tamper evident tape. \nThe Label 5 parcels are placed into the Label 5A ballot paper transport container. \n\nLabel 5a \u2013 Ballot paper transport container (House of Representatives) package \n\nLabel 5a is for all securely fastened containers that contain House of Representatives ballot \npaper bundles, bundled spoilt/discarded envelopes and the Label 5 ballot paper stubs parcel. \nContainers must be securely fastened with plastic seals and the Record of security seals form \ncompleted. Complete the label and place it in the container window. \n\nLabel 6a - Ballot paper transport container (Senate) package \n\nLabel 6a will be used for all ballot paper transport containers that contain bundles of sorted \nSenate ballot papers, including formal, unused, informal and spoilt and discarded ballot \npapers. Ballot paper transport containers must be sealed with plastic seals and the Record of \nsecurity seals form completed. \n\nComplete the label and place it in the container window.  \n\nLabel 8 \u2013 Materials \n\nThis package should contain all other materials, such as badges, handbooks, unused \nenrolment forms, calculators, voter screen \nplastic inserts etc., as listed on the label. It \nmust be sealed with tamper evident tape. \n\nBundling, parcelling and packaging \nof ballot papers \n\nBundling \n\nDuring the House of Representatives and \nSenate scrutinies, ballot papers are sorted to \nindividual candidates or groups and bundled to 50s. There will also be bundles of informal, \nspoilt, discarded and unused ballot papers.  \n\nEach sorted bundle must include the sort card. \n\nTo prevent them becoming unbundled in the transport container, place any large House of \nRepresentatives bundles (usually just the top 2-3 candidates) into separate plastic bags with \nthe sort card visible. These do not need to be labelled or sealed with tamper evident tape. \n\nParcelling  \n\nHouse of Representative ballot paper stubs must be parcelled into a sealed bag before they \ncan be packaged for transport. \n\nA completed Label 5 (House of Representatives) indicating the contents must be affixed to the \nfront of the parcel, with tamper evident tape used to secure the parcel. \n\nNo other ballot papers will be parcelled. \n\nElection Procedures Handbook \u2013 PPLO/OIC/2IC     Page 81\n\n\n--- Page 83 ---\n\nPackaging \n\nBundles of House of Representatives and Senate ballot papers must be packaged ready for \ntransport using the following steps: \n\n\u25aa  place bundles into the relevant ballot paper transport container \n\n\u25aa  complete Label 5a (House of Representatives) or Label 6a (Senate) listing the contents \nof the transport container, have it witnessed by a scrutineer (or polling official if a \nscrutineer isn\u2019t available) and place the label in the container window, and \n\n\u25aa  seal the container and complete the Record of security seals form, placing the form \n\nbehind the label in the container window. \n\nWhen packaging Senate ballot papers, any groups that add up to more than 500 will have to \nbe packaged into more than one transport container. If this happens use another sort card to \nidentify the remaining bundles from the group, for example if your polling place has 600 ballot \npapers sorted to ATL Group C, 500 of them should go in one transport container with a sort \ncard that says \u201cATL Group C\u201d and 600 as the total. The remaining 100 will go in the next \ntransport container with a sort card that says \u201cATL \nGroup C\u201d, but does not identify how many ballot papers. \nEnsure only one sort card records the number of ballot \npapers in the group. \n\nPackaging declaration vote envelopes \n\nPlace reconciled and sorted declaration envelope \nbundles into the plastic container (ballot box) used for \ndeclaration voting, along with the counterfoils folder(s) \nthat contain counterfoils and postal votes handed in.   \n\nComplete Label 2, have it witnessed by a scrutineer (or \npolling official if a scrutineer isn\u2019t available) and place the label in the container window.  \n\nSeal the container with plastic seals (ensure it is sealed on two sides and the top flap) and \ncomplete the Record of security seals form, placing the form in the container window behind \nthe label. \n\nPackaging other election materials \n\nContinue packaging all other election materials using the following steps: \n\n\u25aa  complete the label indicating the contents of the package (label must be signed \n\nand witnessed) \n\n\u25aa  affix the label to the front of the package, do not cover the label with tamper \n\nevident tape, and \n\n\u25aa  Label 1 package should be sealed last as this is the package that contains the OIC \nreturn. Ensure that the OIC return is complete and the attendance record is signed \nbefore sealing this parcel.   \n\nNote: If the contents of any label require more than one package, ensure you label each of \nthem and note the total number of packages. \n\nElection Procedures Handbook \u2013 PPLO/OIC/2IC     Page 82\n\n\n--- Page 84 ---\n\nEmployment and external \nstakeholder information \n\nEmployment conditions \n\nWork health and safety \n\nUnder Commonwealth legislation, staff have a general work health and safety duty of care to \nthemselves and to others.  To enable OICs and their staff to take responsibility for ensuring \nthat the polling place is a safe and healthy area for all staff and members of the public, here \nare a number of WHS actions that must be undertaken: \n\n1.  Instructing a polling staff member to complete the Safety Inspection checklist prior to \n\nthe start of polling. \n\n2.  Providing a WHS briefing to all staff prior to the start of polling, with a check-in at the \n\nend of the workday. \n\n3.  On polling day if an incident occurs, this needs to be reported by using the Incident \n\nNotification Form in the OIC return.   \n\n4.  If at any time you feel you are unfit to continue work on polling day/night you should \n\ninform the PPLO or divisional office. \n\nPreventing injuries \n\nTo avoid potential injuries or illnesses, you must monitor staff workloads and fatigue levels, \nand ensure they take their scheduled breaks. You must also identify the safest and most \nconvenient access route into the polling place, particularly for people with a disability or less \nmobile. \n\nTo prevent slips, trips and falls, during the inspection ensure that: \n\n\u25aa  entrances to the polling place are clear \n\u25aa  electrical cords on floors have been taped down \n\u25aa  any rubbish on floor areas is promptly removed \n\u25aa  mats placed on a slippery floor have a non-slip backing \n\u25aa \n\ntorn carpets or uneven floor surfaces are covered or appropriate warning signs \nprovided \ntraffic areas within and immediately outside the building are well lit, and \n\u25aa \n\u25aa  other hazards, such as fatigue, are mitigated in consultation with the PPLO or \n\ndivisional office. \n\nTo prevent back injuries the OIC should ensure that staff use a trolley, or team lift, to move \nheavy or awkward items. Staff should be advised to:  \n\n\u25aa  avoid bending, twisting and rushing when lifting \n\u25aa  stretch regularly \ntake breaks from prolonged standing or sitting, and \n\u25aa \n\u25aa  alternate task/duties where it is practical to do so.  \n\nElection Procedures Handbook \u2013 PPLO/OIC/2IC     Page 83\n\n\n--- Page 85 ---\n\nOther safety considerations for managing incidents/injuries  \n\nIf a serious incident occurs, call the emergency services first and then contact the DRO \nimmediately. Your primary duty is to ensure, as far as possible, the safety of all persons within \nthe polling place. Procedures to follow for different types of emergencies are located in the \nEmergency Procedures booklet (also listed in Attachment 4). The DRO will assist with any \nfurther requirements. \n\nNote: For the safety of others, and to ensure legislative compliance, please cordon off the \nincident scene where it is reasonably practicable to do so until advised by the DRO that it is \nsafe to release the area for use again.  \n\nEvery polling place will be provided with a basic first aid kit. These kits contain products to \nassist in treating minor injuries (e.g. paper cuts, splinters).  If an injury requires more attention \nor treatment then you must call 000.  \n\nLiability for injuries that occur will be determined by the AEC\u2019s regulator/insurer and will \ndepend upon the circumstances relating to individual incident. Under no circumstances should \nan injured person be provided with an expectation that the AEC will pay medical accounts \nand/or make reimbursement for loss or damage to personal effects. Any queries, from voters, \nof this nature should be directed to the DRO. \n\nHarassment and bullying  \n\nWorkers, who include polling officials and scrutineers, are individually responsible for \npromoting a work environment free from harassment, bullying and discrimination.  \n\nWorkplace bullying is repeated and inappropriate behaviour that could reasonably be \nconsidered to be offensive, humiliating, intimidating, threatening or demeaning to a person or \ngroup of persons, which creates a risk to health and safety.  \n\nWorkplace harassment is any unwelcome, unsolicited and usually unreciprocated behaviour. It \nmakes the workplace unpleasant, humiliating and intimidating and makes it difficult for \neffective work to be done.  \n\nIf there are any allegations of harassment and/or bullying you will need to complete the \nIncident Notification Form included in the OIC return, as this will allow the AEC to contact \ninvolved parties so that a review of the allegation can be conducted.  \n\nPersonal security \n\nAll staff should be aware of the potential danger in exiting buildings late at night.  \n\nIf lighting is not adequate you should arrange to have someone accompany staff to their cars, \nwith a torch if available. \n\nBins \n\nUnder no circumstances are scrutineers, party workers or polling officials to rummage through \nbins inside the polling place in order to recycle party literature, such as how\u2013to-vote cards.  \n\nThere are health and safety reasons for this, and in addition the bins may contain discarded \nballot papers placed there by voters. \n\nSmoking in the polling place \n\nSmoking in the polling place is strictly prohibited. This includes the 6-metre section \nimmediately surrounding the premises.  \n\nElection Procedures Handbook \u2013 PPLO/OIC/2IC     Page 84\n\n\n--- Page 86 ---\n\nWorkplace diversity \n\nThe AEC is committed to the principles and practices of workplace diversity. Through diversity, \nwe foster an inclusive environment that values and utilises the contributions of people of \ndifferent backgrounds, experiences and perspectives.  \n\nDiversity relates to gender, age, language, ethnicity, cultural background, disability, sexual \norientation and religious beliefs.  \n\nDiversity also refers to the many ways people differ in other respects, such as educational \nlevel, job function, socioeconomic background, personality profile, geographic location, marital \nstatus and whether or not they have family or other care responsibilities. \n\nAs the OIC you are responsible for ensuring that all staff are treated fairly and equitably and \nthat they are given the same opportunity to perform the same range of duties. \n\nCustomer service \n\nAll staff employed by the AEC will provide a certain level of service to all our customers. Our \ncustomers include voters, scrutineers, party workers and candidates. \n\nAs a temporary AEC employee you are required to be professional in your dealings with all our \ncustomers and to treat them with respect and courtesy. \n\nProperty \n\nThe AEC accepts no responsibility for the loss of property belonging to employees or for \ndamage to their vehicles in getting to and from, or while at the polling place.  \n\nStaff must therefore ensure that their personal property is safe and secure at all times. \n\nMeal breaks \nAll staff should ensure they have adequate food and refreshments for the day as there may be \nlimited opportunities for polling staff to leave the polling place, and limited availability of \nnearby facilities. Staff may also like to take other small items for personal comfort (e.g. a \ncushion). \n\nRequirement on polling day  \n\nLegislation and AEC policy requires that staff must not work more than 5 continuous hours \nwithout taking a break of at least 30 minutes. AEC employees are obligated to take such a \nbreak as directed by the OIC. \n\nWhile it is preferable that a 30 minute meal break be provided to all polling staff, it is \nacceptable, during peak periods, for staff to have two 15 minute breaks for every 5 hours \nworked. \n\nStaff should be aware that the nature of the work during polling makes it difficult to schedule \nofficial meal breaks that correspond to accepted mealtimes.  Meal breaks are at the direction \nof the OIC and as far as possible the timing of breaks will be mutually agreed between you and \nyour staff.  \n\nElection Procedures Handbook \u2013 PPLO/OIC/2IC     Page 85\n\n\n--- Page 87 ---\n\nManaging meal breaks \n\nIt is the responsibility of OICs to ensure that all staff, including yourself, take regular breaks. \n\nA break is considered to be time away from the actual polling area, in locations such as a tea \nroom, kitchen, or outside the polling place. Staff should not eat or drink at the issuing tables to \navoid the risk of spills on the certified lists or ballot papers. \n\nYou will need to develop a roster before polling begins to ensure all staff are scheduled to take \nthe required breaks throughout the day. The roster should be developed in consultation with \nstaff to ensure that, as far as practicable, the break times are mutually agreed to. \n\nDuring peak polling periods (e.g. mornings on polling day), it may be more practical to provide \nstaff with two 15 minute breaks rather than with a single 30-minute break, however, you must \nensure that all staff take a break of at least 30 minutes duration at some point during the day.  \nAt no stage should a staff member have been on duty for more than 5 hours of continuous \nduty without having taken breaks of 30 minutes in total. \n\nThere is an expectation that breaks will be available to staff throughout the whole working day, \nthis includes during the count after polling. Following is a suggested plan to manage breaks \nduring the count: \n\n\u25aa  provide staff who are not directly involved in the reconciliation of ballot papers with \n\na 15 minute break at 6pm \n\n\u25aa  as staff complete their reconciliation, they take a 15 minute break \n\u25aa  as each staff member completes that 15 minute break they resume after 6pm \n\nduties as required, and \n\n\u25aa  ensure all staff take an additional 15 minute break during the scrutiny to ensure \n\nthe requirement is not breached. \n\nAlternatively, scrutiny assistants arriving at 5pm may be utilised to cover the role of ballot box \nguard or queue controller to allow staff to have a break prior to the close of polling, \n\nIf a staff member refuses to take their allocated breaks, you must explain the requirement to \nthem and advise them that they will be in breach of work health and safety legislation. If they \nstill refuse, inform the PPLO, ensure you record the incident in the Issues and miscellaneous \nmatters form in the return and have another member of staff witness this entry. You must also \nrecord on this form any other issues associated with meal breaks. \n\nElection Procedures Handbook \u2013 PPLO/OIC/2IC     Page 86\n\n\n--- Page 88 ---\n\nCandidates, party workers and scrutineers \n\nIntroduction \n\nCandidates, party workers and scrutineers have very different responsibilities and rights at \npolling places. \n\nCandidates \n\nRights and responsibilities \n\nCandidates are not allowed to take part in any way in the conduct of an election for which they \nare a candidate.  \n\nThey may not be scrutineers and they may not enter a polling place except to record their own \nvote.  \n\nThey may, however, mix with party workers and voters outside the polling place in the \napproved area (i.e. 6 metres from the entrance to the polling place). \n\nParty workers \n\nParty workers will need to adhere to physical distancing measures and any health \nrequirements in force at the time of polling.  \n\nParty workers are expected to provide their own masks if they choose to wear them or if there \nis a requirement to wear a mask. \n\nRights and responsibilities \n\nParty workers distribute how-to-vote material and encourage voters to vote for the party or \ncandidate that they support. This is called \u2018canvassing\u2019.  \n\nAt polling places on polling day candidates and party workers are prohibited by the \nCommonwealth Electoral Act 1918 from canvassing within 6 metres of an entrance to a \npolling place (see Electoral Backgrounder \u2013 Polling place offences at Attachment 5 for further \ninformation).  This provision should be enforced if the activities of party workers obstruct \nvoters.  \n\nAt polling places on polling day, ensure that the \u2018electoral offences\u2019 sign is placed at the \nentrance to the polling place. \n\nParty workers may enter the polling place only once, to record their vote.  \n\nAn exception is made if a voter who needs help nominates a party worker to assist them. Party \nworkers asked to assist voters must remove any political badges they are wearing and cover \nany political logos on clothing etc. before entering the polling place.  \n\nScrutineers \n\nScrutineers will be asked to use hand sanitiser and maintain 1.5m distance when observing \nprocesses inside the polling place including the sealing of ballot boxes and scrutiny of ballot \npapers. Under no circumstances are scrutineers to touch ballot papers or ballot boxes.  \n\nElection Procedures Handbook \u2013 PPLO/OIC/2IC     Page 87\n\n\n--- Page 89 ---\n\nThe following hygiene provisions will be in place for scrutineers: \n\n\u25aa  QR code check-in on relevant state/territory mobile phone app and manual sign-in \n\nsheets if unable to use QR code \n\n\u25aa  hand sanitiser to be used on entry and exit (and as requested) \n\u25aa  masks should be worn if physical distancing is not possible, both during polling and \n\nthe scrutiny \n\n\u25aa  scrutineers are expected to provide their own mask, and \n\u25aa  scrutineers should also maintain hand hygiene while in attendance. \n\nScrutineers play an important role in the election process. It is their job to observe that you are \ndoing your job properly. \n\nDuring polling each candidate can be represented by one scrutineer per issuing point. \n\nDuring the scrutiny each candidate can be represented by one scrutineer per officer counting \nthe votes.  \n\nIt is your responsibility to ensure that scrutineers and party workers do not breach the \nCommonwealth Electoral Act 1918 or the Referendum (Machinery Provisions) Act 1984. \n\nIdentifying scrutineers \n\nScrutineers must present their appointment forms to you on arrival, and you must check to see \nthat: \n\n\u25aa \n\u25aa \n\u25aa \n\nthe name of the polling place has been entered \nthe \u2018undertaking by scrutineer\u2019 on the form has been signed by the scrutineer, and \nthe form has been signed by the candidate (a rubber stamp, facsimile or photocopy \nis sufficient). \n\nA scrutineer may also be appointed by fax or by an imaged signature attached to an email, but \nit must satisfy the above requirements.  \n\nIf these matters are in order, issue the scrutineer with a scrutineer\u2019s badge. A scrutineer must \nalways wear a scrutineer\u2019s badge when inside the polling place. \n\nIf there is no signature, the person cannot be appointed as a scrutineer. Anyone who seeks to \nbe a scrutineer but who does not satisfy these requirements should be told to contact the \nparty, candidate or campaign office. \n\nScrutineers may come and go during polling, or they may be replaced by another scrutineer \nprovided appointment forms are in order. \n\nScrutineers are entitled only to exercise their responsibilities in the election for the candidate \nthat appointed them. In a dual or multi polling place, this means only the division in which that \ncandidate is running. \n\nRights and responsibilities \n\nYou should check with all scrutineers that they are aware of their rights and responsibilities as \noutlined in the Scrutineers handbook.  \n\nYou will be provided with copies of the Quick reference guides for scrutineers and party \nworkers to issue to scrutineers or party workers who ask for information about their duties on \npolling day.  \n\nElection Procedures Handbook \u2013 PPLO/OIC/2IC     Page 88\n\n\n--- Page 90 ---\n\nQuick reference guides are also designed to help you provide accurate information to \nscrutineers and party workers on their rights and responsibilities during polling and scrutiny. \n\nScrutineers may: \n\n\u25aa  observe all voting procedures except the voter actually voting, unless the voter is \n\nbeing assisted by a polling official \n\n\u25aa  object to the right of any person to vote, and \n\u25aa  be nominated by a voter to help with the completion of a ballot paper. \n\nScrutineers must not: \n\nremain in a polling place without a scrutineer\u2019s badge \ntouch ballot papers unless a voter nominates them to assist \ninterfere with, or attempt to influence, any voter \n\n\u25aa \n\u25aa \n\u25aa \n\u25aa  disclose any knowledge gained concerning the vote of a person \n\u25aa  wear a badge or emblem of a political party or candidate within the polling place \n\u25aa  deliberately show or leave in the polling place any how-to-vote card or similar \n\ndirection as to how a voter should vote  \n\n\u25aa  help with the clearing of voting screens or removal of material from the polling area \n\nor assist in transporting polling equipment, or \n\n\u25aa  undertake an action that creates a hazard or otherwise impacts the health and \n\nsafety of voters and staff. \n\nObjections \n\nIf a scrutineer objects to any procedure, or questions staff in any way, staff should immediately \nrefer the matter to you.  \n\nWhere a scrutineer objects to the right of any person to vote, the reasons must be recorded on \nthe Issues and miscellaneous matters form in the OIC return. You must then advise the \nscrutineer that the person may still vote. The DRO will investigate in these circumstances.  \n\nMedia \n\nMedia attendance at polling places \n\nThe three main reasons for media to attend a polling place are to report on: \n\n1.  high profile candidates voting \n2.  voting incidents, or \n3.  voter intentions (exit poll) \n\nEach scenario is outlined below. It is essential that all media requesting access to a polling \nplace, regardless of the scenario, comply with the behaviour requirements listed at the end of \nthis section.  \n\nHigh profile candidates voting \n\nIt is quite common during an election for media to attend a polling place to capture footage of \na high profile candidate casting their vote.  \n\nElection Procedures Handbook \u2013 PPLO/OIC/2IC     Page 89\n\n\n--- Page 91 ---\n\nThe AEC will endeavour, where possible, to gain advanced notice of this activity to inform \npolling staff of impending media presence. If a significant number of media is expected at a \npolling place the AEC will organise for representatives to be present to coordinate media \nrequirements.  \n\nAdvanced notice is not always able to be achieved. Polling staff could encounter requests for \nmedia access \u2013 in the case of particularly high profile candidates this could be a number of \nmedia outlets present at the same time.  \n\nVoting incidents \n\nIf an incident has been identified, media should not be admitted to the polling place unless \napproved by the state/territory manager. If approval is provided, it is essential that media are \nfully aware of the behaviour requirements.  \n\nIn the event of a potential voting incident, no polling staff, including the OIC, should provide \ncomment to the media under any circumstances. You should explain to the media that you are \nnot authorised to provide comment and that they should contact the national media team on \n02 6271 4419, 0419 294 893 or media@aec.gov.au.  \n\nVoter intentions (Exit polls) \n\nJournalists often like to conduct \u2018exit polls\u2019 in which voters are asked, after they leave the \npolling place, how they have voted.   \n\nThis activity should be conducted outside the polling place in accordance with the \nrequirements outlined below. It is essential that exit polls do not disrupt the flow of the polling \nplace and that voters are not pressured into revealing their secret ballot. \n\nJournalist or camera crew requesting to enter a polling place \n\nAs the OIC, if you are asked by journalists and/or a camera crew if they may enter the polling \nplace, you should: \n\n\u25aa  Grant access to the journalist, unless a potential voting incident has been \n\nidentified, in which case DRO approval should be sought. If the polling place is \nparticularly busy you should ask the media if they can either return later or wait \nuntil you have time to accompany them. \n\n\u25aa  Accompany the media while they are in the polling place and organise your 2IC to \nmanage the flow of the polling place while you are busy. Alternatively, you can \ndelegate your 2IC to accompany the media if there is another matter that requires \nyour attention, and you are confident that your 2IC understands the behaviour \nrequirements for media below and is able to enforce these. \n\n\u25aa  Highlight the following three guidelines to the media for particular attention: \n\no \n\nthe flow of voting must not be interrupted - this means that no interviews can \nbe conducted inside the polling place \n\no  media are not allowed to photograph or film the ballot paper secure zone or \n\no \n\nselections on a voter\u2019s ballot paper \nthe wishes of people who do not want to be photographed or filmed must be \nrespected. \n\nElection Procedures Handbook \u2013 PPLO/OIC/2IC     Page 90\n\n\n--- Page 92 ---\n\nBehaviour requirements for media representatives in polling places \n\nTo ensure the efficient conduct of both the voting and counting, access to a polling place \ngranted by the AEC is conditional on the media complying with the polling place rules. \n\nYou can refuse entry or ask a member of the media to leave if the following conditions are not \nmet. \n\n\u25aa  The operation of the polling place must be allowed to continue without disruption \n\nor any inconvenience to voters or polling officials. \n\n\u25aa  Media must adhere to the direction of the Officer in Charge at all times. \n\u25aa  Media are not allowed in the ballot paper secure zone. \n\u25aa  Media are not allowed to film or photograph items in the ballot paper secure zone. \n\u25aa  Any filming of a person voting must ensure that none of the voter's ballot paper \n\nselections can be identified. \n\n\u25aa  The media must not touch any ballot papers or interfere with the operation of the \n\nvoting or the count. \n\n\u25aa  Particular scenes or results cannot be 'recreated' for better effect. \n\u25aa  Ballot papers and other AEC materials must not be removed from the polling place. \n\u25aa  The rights of voters, polling officials and other members of the public in the polling \n\nplace who do not want to be filmed must be respected. \n\n\u25aa  The rights of scrutineers (candidate representatives) who wish to observe the count \n\nclosely must be respected.  \n\nGuidelines for media coverage in polling places are available on the AEC website at \nhttp://www.aec.gov.au/media/media-services.htm.  \n\nRequest for comment \n\nIf the media asks for comment regarding voting, the operation of the polling place or any other \nmatter you should refer them to your DRO or national media team on 02 6271 4419, \n0419 294 893 or media@aec.gov.au. \n\nElection Procedures Handbook \u2013 PPLO/OIC/2IC     Page 91\n\n\n--- Page 93 ---\n\nTroubleshooting \nDo not hesitate to contact your PPLO or divisional office if you require further guidance on ANY \nissue before, during or after polling. \n\nIssuing votes \n\nYou cannot find a voter\u2019s name on the certified list \n\nIssuing officers can ask voters for a form of identification if they are having genuine difficulty in \nunderstanding the voter\u2019s name or locating the voter on the certified list. \n\nIf the name cannot be found, the following may help. \n\n\u25aa  Check the spelling with the voter. \n\u25aa  Ask the voter to print the name on a piece of paper. \n\u25aa  Ask the voter whether they might be enrolled under a different name. \n\u25aa  The voter may be enrolled in another division. \n\u25aa  On the certified list names beginning with \u2018Mc\u2019 are treated as if they are spelt \n\n\u2018Mac\u2019. The apostrophe in names like O\u2019Brien is ignored. Names beginning with \u2018St\u2019 \nare treated as if they are spelt \u2018Saint\u2019: \n\nAdditional questions \n\nThe following additional questions should only be asked if you are unsure of the voter\u2019s identity \nafter asking the first three questions.  \n\n\u25aa  What is your date of birth? and/or  \n\u25aa  What is your gender? \n\nIf you still cannot find the name on the certified list, direct the voter to the declaration vote \nissuing point. \n\nThe wrong name has been marked off the certified list \n\nIf you make a mistake and mark the wrong name off the certified list, you must follow a three-\nstep correction procedure:  \n\nElection Procedures Handbook \u2013 PPLO/OIC/2IC     Page 92\n\n\n--- Page 94 ---\n\nStep 1 Write the letter \u2018W\u2019 for \u2018wrong\u2019 in the left margin against the incorrectly marked name \nand indicate it clearly by drawing an arrow to the roll number. \n\nStep 2 Draw a firm black line from arrowhead to arrowhead on the error correction \nindicator in the top left corner of the same page.  \n\nStep 3 Mark off the correct name. \n\nVoter refuses to have a provisional vote \n\nA voter that cannot be found on the certified list or is marked as already having voted, may \nchoose not to have a provisional vote. If this happens, you must record the voter\u2019s name and \nwhy they were not issued a vote in the Issues and miscellaneous matters form in the OIC \nreturn. \n\nIf a voter wishes to complain, they should be asked to put their complaint in writing and submit \nit via the AEC website.  \n\nWhen checking a declaration vote envelope you realise the wrong \nballot paper was given to the voter \n\nIf an incorrect ballot paper has been issued to a declaration voter, they must hand back the \noriginal ballot paper and be given the correct ballot paper using the spoilt ballot paper \nprocedures, see page 54. \n\nElection Procedures Handbook \u2013 PPLO/OIC/2IC     Page 93\n\n\n--- Page 95 ---\n\nDeclaration voter doesn\u2019t return their completed ballot papers \n\nIf a declaration voter leaves the polling place without returning to the issuing officer to hand in \ntheir completed ballot papers, the issuing officer must: \n\n\u25aa  seal their declaration vote envelope  \n\n\u25aa  put it in the ballot box, and \n\n\u25aa  write \u2018ballot paper not returned\u2019 on the counterfoil, and file. \n\nRunning low on ballot papers \nYou should monitor the allocation of ballot papers carefully throughout the day and inform the \nPPLO if you are getting low on unused ballot papers. The PPLO will provide more ballot papers \nas a priority.  \n\nPhotocopying ballot papers \n\nIf you photocopy a ballot paper, it is essential that you initial it in the circle on the front before \ngiving it to a voter. The OIC must record the quantity copied as an \u2018allocation\u2019 in their House of \nRepresentatives Worksheet and record details on the Issues and Miscellaneous Matters form \nin the OIC return.  \n\nBe careful not to leave the original in the photocopier. \n\nOpen ballot papers \n\nThe number of open ballot papers you should receive is included in the ballot paper inventory. \n\n\u2018Open\u2019 House of Representatives ballot papers are blank ballot papers that can be used if a \npolling place runs short of House of Representatives ballot papers and photocopying is not an \noption. \n\nThe list of candidates booklet is used in the preparation of an open ballot paper, as follows: \n\n\u25aa  PRINT the name of the state or territory and division at the top of the ballot paper \n\u25aa  complete the \u2018number the boxes\u2019 section on the ballot paper (for the number of \n\ncandidates on the ballot paper) \n\n\u25aa  print the candidates\u2019 names and party affiliations exactly as shown in the list of \n\ncandidates booklet  \nrecheck the ballot paper against the list of candidates booklet, and \n\n\u25aa \n\u25aa  cross out the unused section of the ballot paper below the name of the last \n\ncandidate you have listed, using a \u2018Z\u2019 (two horizontal lines connected by a diagonal \nline). \n\nAmending ballot papers \n\nIf you do not have a photocopier or \u201copen\u201d ballot papers, a ballot paper for another division \ncan be altered (as pictured) to represent the correct division by crossing out the candidates\u2019 \nnames and party and following the steps in the open ballot paper instructions above.  \n\nElection Procedures Handbook \u2013 PPLO/OIC/2IC     Page 94\n\n\n--- Page 96 ---\n\nComplaints/other issues \n\nDisturbances during polling \n\nIf a disturbance occurs during the day, either inside or outside the polling place, you should try \nto solve the problem.  \n\nIn any situation, common sense should prevail.  \n\nContact your PPLO if you are concerned. \n\nAdjournment \n\nVoting may be adjourned or temporarily suspended if it is interrupted by a flood, fire, severe \nstorm, outbreak of a riot or open violence, health hazard or any other reason related to the \nsafety of voters.  \n\nIf, for any reason, it is considered that voting should be adjourned or temporarily suspended, it \nis vital that you attempt to telephone the DRO immediately.  \n\nIn this situation, the adjourned or temporarily suspended polling notice must be displayed at \nthe polling place. The DRO will advise you of alternative voting arrangements, which may \ninclude resuming polling later that day or adjourning polling to another day. \n\nRemoval of a person \n\nA scrutineer or any other person who commits any breach or misconduct, or who fails to obey \nyour lawful directions, may be removed from the polling place at your request by the police.  \n\nIf this happens, you must document details in the Issues and miscellaneous matters form in \nthe OIC return and obtain a statement from witnesses. You must also advise the PPLO as soon \nas possible. \n\nCameras in the polling place \n\nPolling officials and scrutineers are not permitted to use any image recording device (including \ncameras, video recorders and mobile phones) to record images of ballot papers or declaration \nvote envelopes, or any other images that might identify a voter and how they have voted, in a \npolling place.   \n\nYou must be notified of anyone using an image recording device. \n\nQueues \n\nIf queues are excessive and ongoing despite following the queue management and voter flow \nprocedures, contact your PPLO to who can report the issue and see whether any assistance \ncan be provided by the divisional office. \n\nPolitical signs and banners \n\nYou may receive complaints from the public, or candidates, that large banners or signs are \nattached to buildings, fences or trees.  \n\nAt a polling place on polling day, provided that the banners or signs are outside the area that \nhas been proclaimed part of a polling place by your \u2018Electoral offences\u2019 sign, their placement is \nnot your responsibility. \n\nElection Procedures Handbook \u2013 PPLO/OIC/2IC     Page 95\n\n\n--- Page 97 ---\n\nYou should advise complainants that the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 does not address \nthe placement of signs outside the proclaimed area (six meters from the entrance to a polling \nbooth).  \n\nThe removal or relocation of signs is a matter for the property owner and is covered by local \ngovernment by-laws and/or state/territory legislation.  \n\nFor example, if someone complains that there are political signs on electricity poles in a street, \nthe person should take the matter up with the electricity supplier for that region, not the AEC. \n\nHowever, if you consider that the banners or signs pose a danger to the public or obstruct \naccess by voters, you should ask that they be relocated. \n\nPolling officials and scrutineers are forbidden to wear political messages on badges and \nclothing when in the polling place.  \n\nHowever, voters are allowed to wear political messages on badges and clothing in the polling \nplace. \n\nParty workers asked to assist a voter or to witness such assistance must remove promotional \nbadges before entering a polling place.  \n\nBallot box opened before 6pm on polling night \nUnder no circumstances should a ballot box that has been used to collect votes be opened \nbefore 6pm on polling night. If this happens votes may not be included in the count and voters \nwill be disenfranchised.  \n\nIf a ballot box is opened prematurely the OIC must: \n\n\u25aa  secure the opened ballot box \n\u25aa  any ballot papers or declaration vote envelopes that have been removed must be \nplaced in a bag and sealed with tamper evident tape and labelled with the \u2018For \ninvestigation\u2019 label. The OIC must complete and sign the label \n\n\u25aa  complete the Prematurely opened ballot box report located in the OIC return, \n\ndescribing the circumstances in which the ballot box was opened, including details \nof any witnesses, and \nthe DRO must be informed immediately. If the ballot box was opened through a \nmalicious act you must bring this to the DRO\u2019s attention. \n\n\u25aa \n\nAll of the above, including the ballot box must be given to the DRO. \n\nIf a ballot box has been intentionally or maliciously opened prematurely it is classified as a \nsecurity incident and the DRO will need your input to report as much information as possible. \n\nElection Procedures Handbook \u2013 PPLO/OIC/2IC     Page 96\n\n\n--- Page 98 ---\n\nCOVID-19 issues \n\nOutlined here and in Attachment 4 Polling place emergency procedures, there are a range of \nissues, incidents and disturbances that may occur at polling locations and appropriate \nresponses, which may include calling authorities to assist. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, \nadditional response measures must be put in place to protect the health and welfare of staff \nand voters. A range of scenarios are outlined below. Record details of any issues on the Issues \nand miscellaneous matters form (EF274) and/or the Incident notification form (EF270) as \nrelevant and inform the PPLO immediately. \n\nStaff member attends a polling place with flu-like symptoms \n\nAsk them to go home. Staff and voters have been asked not to attend polling places if they are \nsick. Wash hands and sanitise any areas they were in contact with. Immediately inform the \ndivisional office if additional staff members are needed. \n\nVoter says they are sick or a voter appears to have symptoms of \nCOVID-19 \n\nIf someone seems ill, check if they are feeling ok first \u2013 do not make assumptions, there could \nbe other reasons for their symptoms. If they are sick, advise the voter that people have been \nasked not to attend a polling place if sick. Ask the voter to leave and seek medical assistance \nand offer them a mask.  \n\nIf this occurs during early voting (up until the Wednesday before polling day), advise the voter \nthey can apply for a postal vote online.  \n\nRecord the voter\u2019s details (name, date of birth and address) on an EF016 elector information \nreport and advise them that the details will be passed on to the division for consideration \nduring the non-voter process.   \n\nDirect the hygiene officer to sanitise any touch points the voter may have been in contact with. \n\nVoter advises a family member or friend has not attended polling \nbecause they are sick or self-quarantining \n\nIf this occurs during early voting (up until the Wednesday before polling day), advise them the \nelector can apply for a postal vote online.  \n\nRecord the voter\u2019s details (name, date of birth and address) on an EF016 elector information \nreport and advise them that the details will be passed on to the division for consideration \nduring the non-voter process.   \n\nVoter attends polling and says they have COVID-19 \n\nThis issue must be taken seriously and may result in needing to adjourn polling. \n\nIf the voter is inside the polling place: \n\n\u25aa  Ask that they leave the polling place.   \n\u25aa \n\nIf the voter is intentionally threatening or refuses to cooperate, call the police to \nassist in removing the person from the polling place, should the behaviour threaten \nthe safe delivery of polling. \n\n\u25aa  Stop all voters from entering the polling place and advise them due to \n\nprecautionary measures there will be a short wait until the polling place re-opens.  \n\nElection Procedures Handbook \u2013 PPLO/OIC/2IC     Page 97\n\n\n--- Page 99 ---\n\n\u25aa  Ask all voters already inside to leave the polling place. If they have received a ballot \npaper they can continue to finalise their vote, if they haven\u2019t, ask them to go back \noutside to the front of the queue while the polling place is quickly sanitised. \n\n\u25aa  Ask all polling staff to assist with touchpoint cleaning of all areas. \n\u25aa  Staff members involved in the transaction may dispose of and replace their PPE as \n\na precaution. This is in addition to washing or sanitising their hands. \n\n\u25aa  When 15 minutes have passed and surfaces are clean, it will be safe to resume \n\nnormal polling activities. \n\n\u25aa  Ensure the DRO is informed and incident report forms completed in the OIC return. \n\nIf the voter has not yet entered the polling place: \n\n\u25aa  The queue controller should call the OIC to assist in managing the voter. \n\u25aa  Ask that they leave the polling place.   \n\nVoter coughing or spitting on ballot paper \n\nThe OIC is authorised to remove a person from the polling place or request the police to do so, \nshould their behaviour threaten safe delivery of polling.  \n\nIf the ballot paper is then discarded \n\nUse gloves to pick up the ballot paper and put it in a spoilt/discarded envelope and give it to \nthe OIC for reconciliation. \n\nThe ballot paper is then placed into the ballot box \n\nIf the voter coughs or spits on a ballot paper and then puts it in the ballot box, ensure the \nincident is recorded and call the DRO. Extra precautions must be taken during the scrutiny. \nInstruct all officials involved in the count to wear gloves, regularly sanitise their hands and not \ntouch their faces. Tables must be sanitised after the scrutiny. \n\nEnsure the DRO is informed and incident report forms completed in the OIC return. \n\nVoter intentionally coughing or spitting on polling officials or other \nvoters, or general contact with someone else\u2019s saliva or other body fluid \nsuch as blood \n\nThe OIC is authorised to remove a person from the polling place or request the police to do so, \nshould their behaviour threaten safe delivery of polling.  \n\nCOVID-19 is known to be transmitted via saliva and other body fluids. The following steps need \nto be taken: \n\n\u25aa  wash the blood or saliva off your skin with soap and lots of running water \n\u25aa  wash the blood or saliva out of your eyes, nose or mouth with lots of cold water \u2013 if \nyou wear contact lenses, rinse before and after taking them out, and spit the water \nout after washing your mouth, and \nif your skin is broken, encourage the wound to bleed and rinse it thoroughly under \nrunning water \u2013 but don't scrub or suck the wound.  \n\n\u25aa \n\nAdvise the affected person to seek medical advice as necessary.  \n\nElection Procedures Handbook \u2013 PPLO/OIC/2IC     Page 98\n\n\n--- Page 100 ---\n\nThe hygiene officer will also need to immediately sanitise the affected area(s) and dispose of \nthe paper towel.  Staff members involved should replace their PPE as a precaution.   \n\nEnsure the DRO is informed and incident report forms completed in the OIC return. \n\nSurface or object contaminated with spit or other bodily fluid \n\nCOVID-19 is known to be transmitted via saliva and other body fluids. The contaminated areas \nmust be sanitised immediately and dispose of the paper towel in the bio-waste bin. Direct any \nstaff involved to wash their hands and replace their PPE as a precaution. \n\nAt an issuing point, if the top ballot paper at an issuing point is contaminated, use gloves to \nplace it in a spoilt/discarded ballot paper envelope. \n\nElection Procedures Handbook \u2013 PPLO/OIC/2IC     Page 99\n\n\n--- Page 101 ---\n\nAttachment 1 Division finder guide \n\nThe division finder is an alphabetical listing of all localities and some streets within a state or \nterritory and is used to determine a voter\u2019s enrolled division. \n\nStaff must always consult it to determine the correct division for any address. \n\nThe division finder consists of three parts: \n\n1.  the front section, which includes instructions, a list of divisional office addresses and a \nlist of institutions and establishments (such as universities and hospitals) that may be \nidentified as a voter\u2019s place of residence, \n\n2.  the locality section, and \n3.  the streets section. \n\nNote: the locality section should be the first section you refer to. \n\nLocality section \n\nSuburbs or localities wholly contained within a division will display the division name. In these \ncases the streets will not be listed in the division finder. \n\nFor example, in this division finder, if \nthe voter\u2019s locality is Bartlet, their \ndivision is Waterford. \n\nIf a locality includes areas in more than one division, comments may be provided to determine \nthe correct division. \n\nFor example, Rawland includes parts \nof the divisions of Milton and Brown, \nso it is necessary to ask the voter if \nthey live in the Childers Council area, \nor the Suay Regional Council area. \n\nThe Locality section will refer to the Street section when more information is required. \n\nFor example, if the voter\u2019s locality is \nRyans, you need to refer to the Street \nsection. \n\nElection Procedures Handbook \u2013 PPLO/OIC/2IC     Page 100\n\n\n--- Page 102 ---\n\nStreet section \n\nStreets may also belong to more than \none division.   \n\nFor example, an address in Alder Ave, \nFulsome may be in the division of Brown \nor the division of Waterford.  \n\nIn this example, the house number \ndetermines the correct division.  \n\nElection Procedures Handbook \u2013 PPLO/OIC/2IC     Page 101\n\n\n--- Page 103 ---\n\nAttachment 2 Ballot paper formality guide \n\nIf you are unsure of the formality of any ballot paper you should always include them with the \nother informal ballot papers. \n\nDo not take unnecessary time examining ballot papers to determine formality.  If on first \nexamination you are unsure of formality, include it with the other informal ballot papers.   \n\nDo not enter into unnecessary discussion with scrutineers regarding formality as all ballot \npapers are re-examined after polling day. \n\nAuthentic ballot papers \n\nGenerally, a ballot paper will carry an official mark (watermark or printed security pattern) and \nthe initials of the issuing officer. However, ballot papers that do not carry these markings are \nnot necessarily informal, for example the OIC may have observed an issuing officer not initial a \nballot paper and needed to remind them to do so, in this case the OIC would expect a number \nof ballot papers may be missing the initials. \n\nIf you are unsure of the authenticity of a ballot paper, place it with the informal ballot papers in \norder for the DRO to decide if it is authentic or not. \n\nIdentification of voter \n\nIf, in your opinion, there is sufficient writing on the ballot paper for someone conducting a \nscrutiny to uniquely identify the voter, the ballot paper is informal. It may be easier to identify a \nvoter if they have written their name on a ballot paper and come from a small community for \nexample, however a common name in a large population would make it much harder to \nidentify the voter. \n\nThis ballot paper is formal. \n\nElection Procedures Handbook \u2013 PPLO/OIC/2IC     Page 102\n\n\n--- Page 104 ---\n\nPrinciples \n\nIntroduction \n\nThe following is information on how to determine the formality of ballot papers that are \nauthentic and do not identify the voter. \n\nThere are five over-arching principles that must be considered when determining the formality \nof any ballot paper: \n\nPrinciple one  \n\nStart from the assumption that the voter has intended to vote formally  \n\nThe assumption needs to be made that a voter who has marked a ballot paper has done so \nwith the intention to cast a formal vote.  \n\nPrinciple two \n\nEstablish the intention of the voter and give effect to this intention  \n\nWhen interpreting markings on the ballot paper, these must be considered in line with the \nintention of the voter.  \n\nPrinciple three \n\nErr in favour of the franchise \n\nIn the situation where the voter has tried to submit a formal vote (i.e. the ballot paper is not \nblank or defaced), the concept of reasonableness should be applied to questions of formality \nand wherever possible be resolved in the voter\u2019s favour. \n\nPrinciple four \n\nOnly have regard to what is written on the ballot paper \n\nThe intention of the voter must be unmistakable, i.e. do not assume what the voter was trying \nto do if it\u2019s not clear \u2013 only consider what is written on the ballot paper. \n\nPrinciple five \n\nThe ballot paper should be construed as a whole \n\nBy considering the number in each box as one in a series, not as an isolated number, a poorly \nformed number may be recognisable as the one missing from the series. \n\nElection Procedures Handbook \u2013 PPLO/OIC/2IC     Page 103\n\n\n--- Page 105 ---\n\nGuidelines \n\nIntroduction \n\nThe following guidelines are to be used when judging ballot paper formality.  \n\nAlteration by polling officials \n\nA fully printed ballot paper for a division may be altered to become a ballot paper for another \ndivision (i.e. the names of the candidates are crossed out by the issuing officer and the names \nof candidates for the other division are written in their place). \n\n\u25aa \n\nIf a ballot paper does not contain the names of every candidate for the division, the \nvote is informal, irrespective of the way the voter has voted. \n\n\u25aa  A ballot paper is acceptable with the surname only of a candidate, as long as no \n\ntwo candidates share a surname, as shown in this example: \n\nIn the case of ballot papers prepared incorrectly by polling officials: \n\n\u25aa \n\n\u25aa \n\n\u25aa \n\n\u25aa \n\nIf the candidate\u2019s given names only are listed on the ballot paper, the vote is \ninformal irrespective of the way the voter has voted. \nIf the political party names are not all correctly listed (e.g. wrong party names listed \nagainst the candidates or party names not listed) the vote is formal if the voter has \notherwise recorded a formal vote. \nIf a ballot paper has the names of any candidate spelt incorrectly (provided the \nidentity of the candidate is still clear) the vote is formal if the voter has otherwise \nrecorded a formal vote. \nIf a ballot paper has the names of the candidates in the wrong order, the vote is \nformal if the voter has otherwise recorded a formal vote. \n\nElection Procedures Handbook \u2013 PPLO/OIC/2IC     Page 104\n\n\n--- Page 106 ---\n\nHouse of Representatives ballot paper \n\nConsecutive series of numbers \n\nA House of Representatives ballot paper is only formal if the voter has indicated a first \npreference and consecutively numbered all boxes. A number in the series may not be repeated \nor skipped. See example 1 below. \n\nIf one box is left blank and all other boxes have been numbered in a consecutive sequence \nstarting with the number \u20181\u2019, the ballot paper is formal.  \n\nIf any candidate has more than one vote, the ballot paper is informal. \n\nOverwriting \n\nAlterations to numbers will not make a ballot paper informal, provided the voter\u2019s intention is \nclear, for example a number can be crossed out and another number written beside it.  See \nexample 2 below. \n\nIf a number is overwritten in a way that makes it impossible to read, then the ballot paper is \ninformal. See example 3 below. \n\nExample 1. \n\nExample 2.  \n\nExample 3. \n\nThe ballot paper above  \nis informal.   \nThe number 7 has been \nrepeated. \n\nThe ballot paper above  \nis formal.   \nThere are eight consecutive \nnumbers reasonably \ndiscernible. \n\nThe ballot paper above is \ninformal.   \nThe overwriting is \nindecipherable. \n\nElection Procedures Handbook \u2013 PPLO/OIC/2IC     Page 105\n\n\n--- Page 107 ---\n\nAcceptable forms of numbering  \n\nTicks (\uf050) or crosses (\uf04f) are not acceptable forms of voting for House of Representatives and \nwill result in informality, see example 1 below. \n\nVoters may use a consecutive series in various styles \u2013 such as: \n\n\u25aa  numerals (1 2 3) \n\u25aa  words (one two three) \n\u25aa \n\u25aa  ordinal numerals (1st 2nd 3rd).  \n\nroman numerals (I II III IV), and \n\nProvided the voter\u2019s intention is clear and no number is repeated or skipped, a mix of the \nabove styles can be used on the same ballot paper and still be formal, see example 2 below. \n\nVoters can use letters in a consecutive series (A, B, C etc.); provided A is the first preference \nand no letters are repeated or skipped. \n\nA mixture of letters and numbers will result in an informal ballot paper, see example 3 below. \n\nExample 1.  \n\nExample 2. \n\nExample 3. \n\nThe ballot paper above is \ninformal. \nA tick is not a valid first \npreference mark \n\nThe ballot paper above \nis formal. \nNumbers can be written as \nwords or figures. \n\nThe ballot paper above \nis informal. \nA mixture of numbers and \nletters has made the voter\u2019s \nintention unclear. \n\nElection Procedures Handbook \u2013 PPLO/OIC/2IC     Page 106\n\n\n--- Page 108 ---\n\nTwo Candidates only \n\nIn the case of only two candidates on a ballot paper, if the voter has placed a \u201c1\u201d in the box \nbeside a candidate and left the second box blank OR inserted any other number the ballot \npaper will be deemed formal. \n\nEmpty boxes  \n\nFor House of Representatives ballot papers a single box may be left empty provided it is the \nlast in the series and on the condition there is no marking in the box at all. A scribble or dot \netc. in the final box will result in informality if it is not recognisable as the next number in the \nseries. See example 1 below. \n\nTwo or more empty boxes on a House of Representatives ballot paper results in an informal \nvote. See example 2 below. \n\nPlacement of votes \n\nThe vote can be made inside the box or beside the box or candidate name, provided the \nintention of the voter is clear. See example 3 below. \n\nExample 1. \n\nExample 2. \n\nExample 3. \n\nThe ballot paper above \nis informal. \nNo discernible figure in the \neighth box, but there is a \nmark in it.  \n\nThe ballot paper above \nis informal. \nThere are two empty boxes.  \n\nThe ballot paper above \nis formal.  \nThe figure beside the eighth \nbox reasonably resembles a \n7.   \n\nElection Procedures Handbook \u2013 PPLO/OIC/2IC     Page 107\n\n\n--- Page 109 ---\n\nVariations in handwriting \n\nUnconventional but recognisable variations in handwriting, such as placing a stroke through \nthe vertical stem of the number 7 or an upward angular stroke before the familiar vertical \nstroke on the figure \u2018one\u2019, should not result in a ballot paper being informal, provided any \nvariations result in a series of numbers and the voter\u2019s intent is obvious. \n\nIf a voter marks a ballot paper with words or figures in a language other than English, the ballot \npaper can be accepted if the voter\u2019s intention is clear. \n\nThe ballot paper above is formal. \nThe figure in the fifth box reasonably resembles \na 1 and the figure in the seventh box \nreasonably resembles a 7. \n\nElection Procedures Handbook \u2013 PPLO/OIC/2IC     Page 108\n\n\n--- Page 110 ---\n\nCandidate name substitution \n\nIf the voter crosses out or replaces a candidate\u2019s name on a ballot paper, that ballot paper is \ninformal, see example 1 below. \n\nNote that this does not include cases where a fully printed ballot paper is altered to become a \nballot paper for another division by a polling official. \n\nIf a candidate name has been added to the ballot paper by the voter and been allocated any \nnumber except the last number, the vote is informal see examples 2 and 3 below. \n\nExample 1. \n\nExample 2. \n\nExample 3. \n\nThe ballot paper above \nis informal. \nThe voter has not indicated \na preference for all  \ncandidates.  \n\nThe ballot paper above \nis formal. \nThe voter has indicated  \na preference for all  \nnominated candidates.  \n\nThe ballot paper above \nis informal  \nThe voter has not indicated \na first preference.  \n\nElection Procedures Handbook \u2013 PPLO/OIC/2IC     Page 109\n\n\n--- Page 111 ---\n\nSenate ballot papers \nAs outlined on page 76, Senate ballot papers are to be sorted into first preference choice \nabove the line (ATL), first choice below the line (BTL) (to group level) or obviously informal. \n\nA strict formality assessment of Senate ballot papers does not occur until the Central Senate \nScrutiny process in the weeks after polling day. \n\nOn election night if a Senate ballot paper does not have one and only one first preference \neither ATL or BTL then it is considered obviously informal. \n\nA ballot paper that is obviously informal ATL can still be formal BTL and vice versa. \n\nA ballot paper that has a first preference ATL and BTL should be sorted to the BTL pile. \n\nThe following are examples of how various types of Senate ballot papers should be \ncategorised. \n\nThe above ballot paper would be categorised as obviously informal.

In this \nBackgrounder definitions for these various terms are: \n\na.  A 'polling booth' is the location provided at a 'polling place' where voting screens are \n\navailable at which voters mark their ballot papers. \n\nb.  A 'polling place' is the street address for the location at which a 'polling booth' is \n\nlocated and at which voting takes place. \n\nc.  The 'person in charge', 'person in charge of premises', 'officer in charge' and 'presiding \nofficer' are all terms used to describe the AEC official responsible for electoral activities \nin particular locations. \n\nd.  The 'officer-in-charge' of each polling place is called the 'presiding officer' during \n\npolling, from 8am to 6pm on election day. From 6pm, however, during the counting of \nthe votes (the scrutiny), this officer is called the 'assistant returning officer'. \n\ne.  A \u2018early voting centre\u2019 is a pre-poll voting office or office of a DRO at which applications \nfor pre-poll votes may be made, or pre-poll ordinary voting is available for the election.  \n\nIntroduction \n\n1. Electoral Backgrounders are published by the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) to \nprovide a basic introduction to electoral law, policy and procedures for the information and \nguidance of all interested parties. \n\n2. The AEC administers the conduct of federal elections under the provisions of the \nCommonwealth Electoral Act 1918 (the Act). \n\n3. This Backgrounder provides introductory information in relation to offences under the Act \nrelevant to polling. More information on some of the offences discussed below, or on those not \ndirectly relevant to polling activities, is contained in other Electoral Backgrounders. \n\n4. Readers should not rely on the information in this document as a statement of how the law \nwill apply in any particular case. Accordingly, if you are in doubt about the interpretation of the \nlaw in particular circumstances you should seek your own independent legal advice.  \n\n5. The Act is available on the Australian Government\u2019s Federal Register of Legislation website. \nUnless otherwise specified, all references to sections are to sections of the Act. Also please \nnote, the words 'voter' and 'elector' are used interchangeably throughout this publication. \n\nOffences \n\nCompulsory voting s. 245 \n\n6. An elector is guilty of an offence if the elector fails to vote at an election unless they have a \nvalid and sufficient reason. For more information on compulsory voting see Electoral \nBackgrounder: Compulsory voting.  \n\n7. However, the effect of sections 231, 233 and 234 is that the voter is actually required to \ntake the issued ballot paper(s) and to retire to the polling booth to mark their vote. It is not \nsufficient compliance to merely have your name marked off and then to leave the polling \nbooth.  \n\n8. If a person found guilty of this offence, a court may impose a penalty of 1 penalty unit. In \naddition, court costs may also be payable. The value of a penalty unit is set by section 4AA of \nthe Crimes Act 1914 (Cth).  \n\nElection Procedures Handbook \u2013 PPLO/OIC/2IC     Page 121\n\n\n--- Page 123 ---\n\nInfluencing the votes of hospital patients or residents of \nnursing homes s. 325A \n\n9.

A person found guilty of this offence may be subject to a penalty up to 5 penalty units.  \n\nCanvassing near polling booths s. 340 \n\nNote: That where a building used as a polling booth or early voting centre is situated in \ngrounds within an enclosure, those grounds (by notice) may be deemed by the DRO to be part \nof the polling booth itself and the entrance to those grounds would become the entrance to the \npolling booth. \n\n27. If a person engages in any of the following activities within a polling booth or early voting \ncentre, or within six metres of the entrance to a polling booth or early voting centre, the person \nis guilty of an offence: \n\n\u2022  Canvassing for votes, \n\u2022  Soliciting the vote of any elector, \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022  Exhibiting any notice or sign (other than an official notice) relating to an election. \n\nInducing any elector not to vote for any particular candidate, \nInducing any elector not to vote at the election, or \n\n28.

A person found guilty of this offence can be subject to a penalty up to 5 penalty units. \n\n35. This prohibition does not apply to: \n\n\u2022  Official instructions, for example posters put up by the AEC to assist voters in voting \n\nformally (so that the vote is counted); and \n\n\u2022  Cases where a person is appointed by an elector to assist that elector to vote under \n\nthe provisions in section 234. Section 234 provides that in cases where a person has \nlow vision, physical disability or literacy issues such that he or she is unable to vote \nwithout assistance, the elector may appoint another person to assist them in marking \ntheir ballot paper. If the elector does not appoint a person to assist them, the presiding \nofficer of the polling place may do so. The elector may indicate how the ballot paper is \nto be marked by presenting a how-to-vote card to the presiding officer. This \npresentation of a how-to-vote card does not contravene section 335. \n\nMaking false statements to voters about enrolment s. \n330 \n\n36.

The person in charge of a polling booth is the presiding officer or the substitute presiding \nofficer. A person in charge of an early voting centre is the Divisional Returning Officer or early \nvoting officer. \n\n41. In a polling booth or early voting centre, a person must not commit misconduct or disobey \na lawful direction given by the person in charge of the premises. \n\n42. A person must not enter or remain in a polling booth or early voting centre without the \npermission of the person in charge of the premises, with the exception of polling officials, \nscrutineers or electors who enter the polling booth for the purpose of voting, and who should \nremain no longer than is reasonably necessary to do so. \n\n43. A person who contravenes any of these things at a polling booth may be lawfully removed \nfrom the polling booth by a police officer or a person authorised by the person in charge of the \npremises. \n\n44. If a person is prosecuted and found guilty of this offence, they may be subject to a penalty \nup to 5 penalty units. \n\nOfficers and scrutineers to observe secrecy s. 323 \n\n45.

A person found guilty of this offence may be subject to a penalty of up to 10 penalty units, \nimprisonment for six months, or both. \n\nScrutineers influencing or communicating with voters in \npolling booths s. 218 \n\n47. A scrutineer must not interfere with or attempt to influence any voter within the polling \nbooth, or communicate with any person in the polling booth except so far as it is necessary in \nthe discharge of the scrutineer's functions. \n\n48. The penalty prescribed for breaching this provision can be subject to a penalty of up to 10 \npenalty units, imprisonment for six months, or both. \n\n49. The Act requires all scrutineers to wear a badge identifying them as a scrutineer whilst in \nthe polling booth. The badges are supplied by the AEC. \n\n50. A scrutineer who breaches these requirements, commits misconduct or fails to obey the \nlawful directions of the presiding officer, may be removed from the polling booth by a member \nof the Australian Federal Police (AFP), the state or territory police force, or another person \nauthorised by the presiding officer. \n\nElection Procedures Handbook \u2013 PPLO/OIC/2IC     Page 125\n\n\n--- Page 127 ---\n\nObligations of persons present when pre-poll vote cast s. \n200K \n\n51. A person who is present when an elector signs a pre-poll vote certificate for declaration \nvoting or marks a ballot paper must not interfere with the elector in relation to the elector's \nvote, do anything that would enable the person to find out how the elector marked the ballot \npaper or make any communication to the elector in relation to the elector\u2019s vote. \n\n52. The penalty for breaching this provision is subject to a penalty up to 10 penalty units. \n\nPossible repercussions for persons who commit offences \n\n53. If the AEC becomes aware that a person is breaching the provisions of the Act during \npolling, any or all of the following actions may be taken.  \n\nRemoval from the premises \n\n54. Section 348 provides that where a person commits misconduct in a polling booth, \ncounting centre or early voting centre, the person in charge of the premises may direct that \nperson to leave the premises or have the person removed from the premises. \n\nInjunctions \n\n55. Section 383 of the Act provides that the Federal Court may grant an injunction to (amongst \nother things) prohibit a person from engaging in conduct that constitutes a contravention of \nthe law in relation to elections. \n\n56. The AEC and candidates in the election may make an application for an injunction to the \nFederal Court. If the AEC is informed or becomes aware that a person may have committed an \noffence, the AEC determines whether it is appropriate in the circumstances to apply for an \ninjunction. The Federal Court is able to order injunctions at short notice on Election Day. \n\n57. If an injunction is granted against a person, failure to comply with the injunction order may \nconstitute contempt of court, for which the Federal Court can order arrest and detention. \n\nProsecutions \n\n58. When the AEC becomes aware of a person engaging in activity that may constitute a \nbreach of an offence provision, the AEC may refer the matter to the AFP for investigation. The \nAFP may then refer the matter to the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions for \nconsideration, in accordance with the Commonwealth Prosecution Policy, as to whether a \nprosecution is initiated. \n\nCourt of Disputed Returns  \n\n59. There is a risk that if a person has engaged in an 'illegal practice' (which is defined in \nsection 352 to be a contravention of the Act or Regulations) the election of a candidate could \nalso be challenged in the Court of Disputed Returns (CDR). Section 362 gives the CDR the \npower to void an election on the grounds of an illegal practice where the Court is satisfied that \nthe results of the election was likely to have been affected as a result of the practice (see \nMitchell v Bailey (No.2) [2008] FCA 692 and Scott-Irving v Oakeshott [2009] FCA 487). \n\nElection Procedures Handbook \u2013 PPLO/OIC/2IC     Page 126\n\n\n--- Page 128 ---\n\nConclusion \n\n60.

Legislative background \n\n1.1  Section 238B of the Electoral Act and s 41AB of the Referendum Act outline the process that the AEC \n\nand its officers are to undertake when a ballot box is opened prematurely. \n\n2.  Prematurely opened ballot box \n\n2.1  A prematurely opened ballot box includes any ballot box: \n\n\u2022 \n\ncontaining either ordinary ballot papers or declaration vote envelopes, that has been opened before \nthe relevant legislated time frame1 \n\n\u2022  discovered to have been opened before the legislated time frame 2  \n\n\u2022  where the seal numbers do not match the numbers recorded on the Record of security seals form, \n\nand the discrepancy cannot be explained. \n\n2.2 \n\nIt excludes ballot boxes where a seal was not affixed correctly in the first place and/or the seal has been \naccidentally damaged and requires replacement. These types of instances are to be dealt with as part of \nnormal operations. \n\n2.3  The legislated time frame for opening ballot boxes is as follows: \n\nBallot boxes \n\nPrior to election day \n\nBefore 6 pm \n\nAfter 6 pm \n\nContaining pre-poll ordinary \nballot papers \n\nUnable to be opened for \nany reason \n\nAble to be opened to sort \n(but not count) from 4pm \non election day \n\nAble to be opened for \nscrutiny \n\nContaining other (static or \nmobile) ordinary ballot papers \n\nUnable to be opened for \nany reason \n\nUnable to be opened for \nany reason \n\nAble to be opened for \nscrutiny \n\nContaining ONLY declaration \nvote envelopes in a static \npolling place, PPVC or mobile \nteam \n\nUnable to be opened for \nany reason \n\nUnable to be opened for \nany reason \n\nAble to be opened for \nsorting and forwarding of \nenvelopes \n\nContaining ONLY declaration \nvote envelopes at an \noverseas post \n\nAble to be opened for \nsorting and forwarding of \nenvelopes  \n\nAble to be opened for \nsorting and forwarding of \nenvelopes \n\nAble to be opened for \nsorting and forwarding of \nenvelopes \n\nContaining ONLY declaration \nvote envelopes; held by a \nDRO \n\nAble to be opened for \npreliminary scrutiny, \npreparation for \ndeclaration exchange \nand forwarding of \nenvelopes within OPCs \n\nAble to be opened for \npreliminary scrutiny, \npreparation for \ndeclaration exchange \nand forwarding of \nenvelopes within OPCs \n\nAble to be opened for \npreliminary and further \nscrutinies and declaration \nexchange \n\n3       POLICY PREMATURELY OPENED BALLOT BOX\n\n\n--- Page 4 ---\n\n3.  Investigation process \n\n3.1  The premature opening of a ballot box (including declaration vote ballot boxes) or the discovery of a \n\nprematurely opened ballot box triggers the requirement to undertake: \n\n\u2022  an investigation into and recording of the details of the premature opening of the ballot box \n\n\u2022  an examination of the ballot papers or declaration vote envelopes in the prematurely opened ballot \n\nbox to enable the Australian Electoral Officer (AEO) for the state or territory concerned to determine \nif they are to be included or excluded from scrutiny. \n\n3.2  The identification of prematurely opened ballot boxes and actions to be taken are the same for federal \n\nelections and referendums, or where the two events are held concurrently.  \n\n3.3  The Prematurely Opened Ballot Box SOP details the correct process to undertake an investigation and \nthe subsequent actions. These procedures must be followed where an officer suspects there is a \nprematurely opened ballot box.  \n\n4.  Scenario guide \n\n4.1  Certain scenarios may be breaches of the Ballot Paper Handling Policy, but are not considered a \nprematurely opened ballot box. These should be dealt with as part of normal operations. \n\n4.2  The following scenario guide provides further information on the definition of what constitutes an \u2018opened\u2019 \n\nballot box.

Overview \n\n1.1  Section 238B of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 (the Electoral Act) and s 41AB of the Referendum \n(Machinery Provisions) Act 1984 (the Referendum Act) prescribe procedures that polling officials, \nDivisional Returning Officers (DROs) and Australian Electoral Officers (AEOs) must follow if a ballot box \ncontaining ballot papers has been opened prematurely \n\n1.2  The premature opening of a ballot box, or the discovery of a prematurely opened ballot box, triggers the \n\nrequirement to undertake: \n\n\u2022 \n\n\u2022 \n\nan investigation of the events leading up to the prematurely opening of the ballot box \n\nan examination of the ballot papers and declaration vote envelopes in the prematurely opened ballot \nbox to enable the AEO for the state or territory concerned to determine if they are to be included or \nexcluded from scrutiny. \n\n1.3  Further information, including what is and what isn\u2019t considered a prematurely opened ballot box, is \n\nlocated in the Prematurely Opened Ballot Box Policy. \n\n2.  Role of polling staff  \n\n2.1  Polling staff who become aware that a ballot box containing ballot papers has been opened prematurely \n\nmust immediately report this to the Officer-in-Charge (OIC) or Team Leader. \n\n2.2  Once notified of the prematurely opened ballot box, according to the instructions in the Election \n\nProcedures Handbook, the OIC or Team Leader must: \n\n\u2022 \n\n\u2022 \n\n\u2022 \n\ntake the ballot box and any loose ballot papers to the ballot paper secure zone \n\nsecure the opened ballot box \n\ncount the ballot papers and/or declaration envelopes that were contained in the ballot box and place \nthese in a parcel \n\n\u2022 \n\nseal the parcel and affix with Label 33 \u2013 For AEO Investigation \n\n\u2022  write on the label an indication of the type of ballot papers enclosed and that the ballot box has been \n\nprematurely opened \n\n\u2022 \n\nsign the label. \n\n2.3  The OIC/Team Leader must alert the Polling Place Liaison Officer (PPLO) / Early Voting Liaison Officer \n\n(EVLO) or DRO immediately about the incident. \n\n2.4  The OIC/Team Leader must ensure that the parcel containing ballot papers is sealed with tamper evident \n\ntape.  \n\n2.5  The OIC/Team Leader must prepare a report using the Prematurely opened ballot box report (EF285) \n\nfound in the return or materials catalogue, about the circumstances in which the ballot box was opened \nprematurely, including details of any witnesses. \n\n2.6  This report must be provided to the DRO along with the parcel, ballot box and any other thing the \n\nOIC/Team Leader considers appropriate as soon as practicable. A Ballot Paper Transfer Record (EF405) \nmust be completed. \n\n2.7  Transport of the ballot papers must comply with transport requirements as per the Ballot Paper Handling \n\nPolicy. \n\n3       SOP PREMATURELY OPENED BALLOT BOX\n\n\n--- Page 4 ---\n\n3.  Role of Divisional Returning Officer  \n\n3.1  The DRO for the division must examine the report, parcel, ballot box and any other thing provided by the \nOIC/Team Leader and provide all materials to the AEO for their state or territory. DROs must ensure that \nthey record the event and details of their observations and the report in the election diary. \n\n3.2  The DRO must ensure that an appropriate ballot paper secure zone is established to undertake this \nexamination. They must also ensure that when transporting ballot papers to the AEO, transport \nrequirements as per the Ballot Paper Handling Policy are complied with. The Ballot paper transfer record \n(EF405) must be completed at the time the transfer of custody of ballot paper takes place and retained on \nfile in the election diary. \n\n4.  Role of Australian Electoral Officer  \n\n4.1  The AEO must open the parcel and examine the ballot papers not enclosed in declaration envelopes, the \ndeclaration envelopes, the ballot box, the report and anything provided by the OIC via the DRO, and \ndecide whether ballot papers are to be included in the scrutiny and whether declaration envelopes are to \nbe included in preliminary scrutiny. \n\n4.2  The AEO must decide that a ballot paper is to be included into the scrutiny unless the AEO is satisfied \n\nthat the ballot paper has been fraudulently altered or otherwise interfered with so as not to reflect the \nvoter\u2019s intention. \n\n4.3  The AEO must decide that an envelope is to be included in preliminary scrutiny unless the AEO is \n\nsatisfied that the envelope has been fraudulently altered. \n\n4.4  After examining all the ballot papers and envelopes, the AEO must place in separate parcels: \n\n\u2022 \n\n\u2022 \n\n\u2022 \n\n\u2022 \n\nall ballot papers that are to be included in the scrutiny \n\nall ballot papers that are to be excluded from the scrutiny \n\nall declaration envelopes that are to be included in preliminary scrutiny \n\nall declaration envelopes that are to be excluded from preliminary scrutiny. \n\n4.5  The AEO must then seal each parcel with tamper evident tape, and complete and affix Label 36 \u2013 AEO \n\nDecision. \n\n4.6  The AEO must then return the parcels containing ballot papers and declaration envelopes to the DRO for \nthe relevant division for inclusion or exclusion from either the scrutiny or preliminary scrutiny as the case \nrequires. The AEO must ensure that an EF405 is completed for each parcel at the time the transfer of \ncustody takes place. This form must be retained on file. \n\n4.7  Section 238B(14) of the Electoral Act requires that the AEO is responsible for the safe custody of the \n\nballot papers and declaration envelopes they have determined to be excluded from the scrutiny.

Environmental impact and direct considerations of wealth/corporate influence are less prominent, though addressed indirectly.\n\n**Social Justice & Civil Liberties: Strong Alignment**\n\n1.  **Voter Enfranchisement as Paramount:** The documents explicitly prioritize \"prevention of voter disenfranchisement\" and the \"integrity of the result\" above other concerns like customer service (EPH p.5). This is a core progressive value, ensuring every eligible citizen's right to vote is protected.\n2.  **Equitable Access and Non-Discrimination:**\n    *   **COVID-19 Measures:** Crucially, polling staff are instructed *not* to enforce COVID-19 safety measures to the extent of \"denying the franchise of any Australian citizen who is eligible to vote\" (EPH p.6). This demonstrates a clear commitment to civil liberties over strict compliance where the two might conflict.\n    *   **Assisted Voting:** Detailed procedures ensure voters requiring assistance due to physical injury, disability, low literacy, or diverse linguistic backgrounds receive help (EPH p.58-60). This includes allowing nominated assistants (friends, family, even party workers *if nominated*), AEC staff, and interpreters, actively promoting inclusivity.\n    *   **Respectful Communication:** A dedicated section emphasizes treating people with disabilities and those from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds with respect, avoiding condescension, and offering appropriate support (EPH p.60-62).\n    *   **Queue Management:** Instructions to queue controllers specifically mention \"escorting elderly and frail voters to the head of the queue\" (EPH p.17), indicating a practical approach to accessibility.\n3.  **Upholding Voter Intent:** The comprehensive \"Ballot Paper Formality Guide\" (EPH Attachment 2) operates on the principle to \"Start from the assumption that the voter has intended to vote formally\" and to \"Err in favour of the franchise.\" This approach aims to maximize the count of votes, even if imperfectly marked, directly supporting the democratic will.\n4.  **Protection Against Disenfranchisement from Errors:** The policy for \"Prematurely Opened Ballot Box\" and its SOP (SOP 4.2) state that the Australian Electoral Officer (AEO) *must* decide to include ballot papers \"unless the AEO is satisfied that the ballot paper has been fraudulently altered or otherwise interfered with so as not to reflect the voter\u2019s intention.\" This places a high bar for exclusion, protecting votes even in compromised circumstances, further reinforcing voter enfranchisement.\n\n**Wealth Distribution & Corporate Influence: Indirect Alignment**\n\n1.  **Anti-Corruption Measures:** The \"Polling place offences\" (EPH Attachment 5) list severe penalties for \"Bribery\" (s.326), \"Interference with political liberty\" (s.327), and \"Misleading or deceptive publications\" (s.329). These legal safeguards aim to prevent illicit financial or undue influence from wealthy individuals or corporations from distorting the electoral process.\n2.  **Neutrality and Secrecy:** Prohibitions on polling officers and scrutineers displaying political affiliations (s.341) and the strict adherence to voter secrecy (s.323) ensure that the voting environment is neutral and free from overt pressure, which could otherwise be leveraged by powerful entities.\n3.  **Canvassing Restrictions:** The 6-meter exclusion zone for canvassing around polling places (s.340) limits direct, last-minute political campaigning, which often relies on well-funded party workers, thus reducing direct, immediate pressure on voters.\n\n**Environmental Impact: Minimal Mention**\n\n1.  **Hygiene and Waste Management:** The documents briefly mention \"sanitising spray,\" \"paper towels,\" \"extra bin liners,\" and a \"dedicated PPE bin\" (EPH p.23, 36). While necessary for public health, the materials described are largely single-use, with no apparent emphasis on broader environmental sustainability, recycling initiatives, or reducing the carbon footprint of election administration. This indicates environmental impact is not a primary focus within these specific operational guidelines.\n\n**Civil Liberties: Areas of Potential Nuance**\n\n1.  **Compulsory Voting:** While a cornerstone of Australian democracy and often supported by progressive movements for ensuring broad participation, compulsory voting (s.245) inherently restricts the civil liberty of choosing *not* to vote. The documents do not debate this but clearly outline the procedural requirement for voters to mark and deposit their ballot to fulfill this obligation (EPH Attachment 5, p.121).\n2.  **Omission of \"Foreign Objects\" List:** The FOI request specifically asked for \"A list of the identifiers of foreign objects received in ballot boxes.\" While the documents explain *why* such objects are not retrieved (integrity of the ballot is paramount, EPH p.5), the actual list itself was omitted. For a left-leaning analyst, this minor omission could be seen as a missed opportunity for full transparency, potentially revealing insights into voter engagement, protests, or even system-level issues, though the AEC's rationale for non-retrieval and non-disclosure (beyond the procedural) is not provided here.\n\nIn conclusion, the AEC's operational documents largely align with progressive values by emphasizing the integrity, accessibility, and fairness of the electoral process, prioritizing the individual's right to vote and protecting it from undue influence or error. While direct environmental considerations are minimal, and the implications of compulsory voting are a broader societal debate, the detailed procedures reflect a strong commitment to core democratic principles crucial for social justice and civil liberties.", "model": "gemini-2.5-flash", "generated_at": "2025-06-22T14:06:18.922464", "source_hash": "dbeebf23922d63a5a4a080683b47e71f2bcab23cd92c4e3f39a45eddcaf30d34", "raw_response_path": "data/llm_responses/LEX3041__overall__left_leaning__20250622T140618.json", "output_tokens": 1220, "prompt_tokens": 66085, "total_tokens": 70805, "summary_length": 5993}, "short_index": {"text": "The Australian Electoral Commission's operational documents align strongly with progressive values, particularly social justice and civil liberties, by fundamentally prioritizing voter enfranchisement and the integrity of results.

From a right-leaning analytical perspective, these documents reveal both commendable alignments with conservative principles and notable deviations.\n\n**Alignment with Conservative Principles:**\n\n*   **National Security & Election Integrity:** The paramount focus on \"Integrity of the result\" and the explicit emphasis on \"Safe custody and handling of ballot papers\" (EPH p. 5) strongly align with national security interests in safeguarding the democratic process. Strict protocols for securing ballot boxes, establishing \"secure zones\" for materials (EPH p. 27), and continuous supervision underscore a commitment to preventing fraud and maintaining the sanctity of the vote. The detailed procedures for managing \"prematurely opened ballot boxes\" (Policy/SOP) further reinforce an institutional dedication to investigating and mitigating potential breaches, promoting public trust in election outcomes. Robust rules against canvassing too close to polling places, misleading publications, and voter impersonation (Attachment 5) directly protect the integrity of individual voting choices from undue influence.\n*   **Individual Liberty (Voter's Franchise):** The AEC's commitment to \"Maintaining integrity of a person\u2019s right to vote (prevention of voter disenfranchisement)\" (EPH p. 5) and ensuring voter anonymity through strict ballot secrecy measures (EPH p. 52) are crucial for individual liberty. Provisions for assisted voting for those with disabilities or language barriers also demonstrate a commitment to universal access to the franchise.\n\n**Deviations from Conservative Principles:**\n\n*   **Limited Government & Economic Efficiency:** The sheer volume and prescriptive nature of the Election Procedures Handbook (137 pages of minute detail) point to an expansive, highly centralized, and bureaucratic approach to election management. Every aspect, from staff roles (OIC, 2IC, PPLO, Queue Controller, Hygiene Officer, Ballot Box Guard, Inquiry Officer, Scrutiny Assistant) to the precise placement of tape on floors, is meticulously dictated. This level of micromanagement suggests a significant governmental footprint in electoral operations, potentially sacrificing local autonomy and agility for rigid uniformity.\n    *   **Fiscal Responsibility & COVID-19 Measures:** The extensive COVID-19 safety measures (1.5m distancing, capacity limits, mandatory staff vaccination, regular touchpoint cleaning, dedicated \"Hygiene Officers,\" provision of PPE, sanitiser, and extra bins) impose substantial additional costs and operational overhead. While presented as health and safety imperatives, these measures represent a significant increase in public expenditure and administrative complexity. A conservative perspective would question the economic efficiency of such prescriptive and resource-intensive interventions, especially if less costly alternatives could achieve similar health outcomes without sacrificing operational agility or fiscal prudence.\n*   **Individual Liberty (Staff):** The requirement for all polling staff to be \"fully vaccinated or have an approved medical exemption\" (EPH p. 6, 13) represents a clear infringement on individual medical liberty for those employed by the AEC. While the policy states voters cannot be denied their franchise for COVID-19 non-compliance (EPH p. 6), this double standard for staff reflects a governmental overreach into personal health decisions for its employees. Furthermore, the detailed regulation of staff breaks and the obligation for employees to adhere to them, even under threat of work health and safety legislation breach (EPH p. 85-86), can be seen as excessive government intervention in employment conditions.\n\nIn conclusion, while the documents showcase a strong dedication to the integrity and security of the electoral process, core conservative tenets, they also illustrate a tendency towards expansive government bureaucracy and potentially inefficient allocation of resources, particularly magnified by the extensive COVID-19 protocols that impinge on individual liberties of electoral staff.", "model": "gemini-2.5-flash", "generated_at": "2025-06-22T14:06:47.432191", "source_hash": "dbeebf23922d63a5a4a080683b47e71f2bcab23cd92c4e3f39a45eddcaf30d34", "raw_response_path": "data/llm_responses/LEX3041__overall__right_leaning__20250622T140647.json", "output_tokens": 802, "prompt_tokens": 66085, "total_tokens": 69381, "summary_length": 4359}, "short_index": {"text": "The AEC's FOI documents reveal a mixed bag from a right-leaning perspective.

Despite the explicit FOI request, this crucial data was not provided, suggesting either a concerning failure to record such incidents, or a deliberate lack of transparency in disclosing them. The Election Procedures Handbook (EPH) even acknowledges that voters drop \"something personal into the ballot box,\" explicitly directing staff to *never* open the box to retrieve it, prioritizing \"integrity of the result\" over citizen property. This confirms that \"foreign objects\" are a known, recurring issue, yet the data on *what* these objects are, and *how often* they occur, remains hidden.\n\nFurthermore, the documents expose questionable resource allocation and decision-making:\n\n*   **Insecure Ballot Boxes:** Despite their central role in elections, cardboard and polypropylene \"ballot boxes\" are explicitly labeled as \"not a secure container.\" This inherent insecurity necessitates the constant presence of a \"ballot box guard\" and strict procedures for \"prematurely opened ballot boxes.\" This points to an inefficient use of human resources to compensate for fundamentally inadequate equipment, rather than investing in more secure infrastructure. The fact that the Prematurely Opened Ballot Box Policy and SOP are necessary at all, and include scenarios like boxes \"splitting\" or seals \"coming off,\" underscores this vulnerability.\n*   **Bureaucratic Over-engineering and Waste:** The sheer volume and prescriptive detail of the EPH (137 pages) and supporting SOPs demonstrate an excessive reliance on process. While some structure is necessary, the granular instructions \u2013 down to sanitizing pencils, voting screens every 10-15 minutes, and mandating double-lined PPE bins \u2013 suggest an over-engineered response, potentially leading to significant time and resource drain with questionable real-world impact. This level of micro-management can stifle efficiency and waste taxpayer money on disproportionately high compliance costs.\n*   **Voter Roll Inaccuracies and Disenfranchisement Risks:** The procedures for handling voters whose names \"cannot be found\" on the certified list, or are \"already marked as having voted,\" expose potential systemic inaccuracies in the electoral roll. The requirement for \"Elector information reports\" to document \"errors,\" \"spelt incorrectly\" names, \"inaccurate address details,\" or names appearing \"twice\" on the list, highlights a recurring problem that could lead to voter disenfranchisement or, conversely, opportunities for fraudulent voting if not meticulously managed.\n*   **Subjective Authority Over Ballots:** The \"Prematurely Opened Ballot Box SOP\" grants the Australian Electoral Officer (AEO) the power to \"decide whether ballot papers are to be included or excluded from scrutiny\" if a box is opened prematurely. This introduces a subjective layer of authority, allowing a single official to determine the fate of ballots based on their satisfaction that a ballot \"has not been fraudulently altered.\" This discretionary power, particularly in a high-stakes scenario, could be perceived as a vulnerability to abuse or unscrutinized decision-making that influences election outcomes.\n*   **Shifted Liability:** The AEC explicitly states it \"accepts no responsibility for the loss of property belonging to employees or for damage to their vehicles.\" While standard, in the context of temporary government employment, this highlights the agency's willingness to offload risk onto its casual workforce, despite the critical national service they provide.\n\nIn summary, these documents paint a picture of an agency that prioritizes bureaucratic control and procedural adherence, even at the cost of transparency, efficient resource management, and direct responsiveness to citizen issues, while simultaneously revealing inherent vulnerabilities in its physical security protocols and data integrity.

The \"playbooks\" provided are *not* a \"procedural response to a foreign object,\" but specifically to a \"prematurely opened ballot box,\" sidestepping the core of the request regarding *what* foreign objects are found and how *they* are dealt with, implying a systemic blind spot or cover-up for non-ballot contaminants.\n\n**Damning Implications from the Election Procedures Handbook (EPH):**\n\n*   **Hypocrisy of Stated Principles:** The Electoral Commissioner\u2019s message boasts of Australia's system being \"one of the fairest and most open\" with a focus on \"trusted, consistently reliable, high quality, high integrity elections,\" claiming \"no exceptions\" to strictly followed procedures. This self-congratulatory rhetoric is immediately and brutally undermined by the subsequent content.\n*   **Prioritizing Appearance Over Actual Integrity:** The EPH explicitly states (Page 5), \"although it may be distressing for a voter if they have dropped something personal into the ballot box, you must never open the ballot box to retrieve it as the integrity of the result is first priority.\" This is a monumental admission of a flawed integrity model. It prioritizes the *unbroken seal* of the ballot box over the *actual contents* of the box. This policy is a glaring vulnerability:\n    *   It allows for the deliberate insertion of *any* foreign object (e.g., electronic devices, propaganda, materials intended to spoil votes, or even bio-hazards) into a ballot box with no immediate mechanism for detection or removal.\n    *   It suggests that the \"integrity of the result\" is maintained by *not knowing* if the contents are compromised, effectively sweeping potential contamination or tampering under the rug. This is a policy of willful ignorance.\n*   **Fundamental Security Weaknesses:**\n    *   **\"Ballot boxes are cardboard or moulded plastic... Although they are sealed, they are not a secure container, and should not be left unattended in public view at any time.\" (Page 26)** This is an astonishing confession. The primary repository of votes is openly admitted to be \"not a secure container.\" This highlights a catastrophic failure in fundamental security design, exposing the entire voting process to compromise through simple theft or tampering. Relying on continuous human \"guarding\" (Page 16) is a weak and fallible substitute for secure containers.\n    *   **\"Ballot papers... must be kept in a secure zone... visible to the OIC but not readily accessible to the public.\" (Page 27)** \"Not readily accessible\" is not \"secure.\" This is a low bar for protecting the most sensitive election material.\n    *   **\"Transport containers must remain closed but do not need to be sealed during polling.\" (Page 27)** This creates a massive window of opportunity for tampering or theft of unallocated ballot papers, as they are unsecured for the entire polling day.\n    *   **\"Leaving ballot papers or certified lists in a vehicle overnight is strictly prohibited.\" (Page 27)** This explicit prohibition implies a historical failure or known risk, revealing a reactive fix to a basic security oversight.\n*   **Normalization of Incompetence and Errors:**\n    *   The document lists \"Balancing errors commonly occur because of: inaccurate counting of ballot papers before polling, a miscount of unused ballot papers at the end of polling, ordinary votes placed in incorrect division\u2019s ballot box (if a dual or multi), including discarded declaration ballot papers in the total figures, or not including the OIC\u2019s unallocated ballot papers in the total number of unused papers.\" (Page 72). This isn't a \"troubleshooting\" list; it's a litany of fundamental, recurring failures in basic inventory management and procedural adherence that are *expected* to occur.\n    *   The instruction to \"Do not take any more time by searching or recounting again. This will delay the release of results\" (Page 72) explicitly prioritizes the speed of reporting results over achieving accurate reconciliation of ballots, directly undermining the stated principle of \"Integrity of the result.\" This is a clear instruction to tolerate discrepancies.\n*   **Vulnerability to Duplicate Voting and Coercion:**\n    *   If a voter's name is already marked as having voted, but they claim not to have, they are \"directed to the declaration vote issuing point.\" (Page 48) This means the system allows for potential duplicate voting in real-time, relying on post-election \"investigation\" rather than real-time prevention, opening the door for systemic abuse.\n    *   For assisted voting, \"A voter can nominate any person (except a candidate) to help them.\" (Page 58) This allows party workers, friends, or family members to directly assist with the marking of a ballot, opening a clear avenue for undue influence, coercion, or even direct manipulation of votes, fundamentally compromising the secrecy and freedom of the ballot for vulnerable voters. The presence of scrutineers to \"observe how the ballot paper is completed\" further erodes the principle of ballot secrecy for those needing assistance.\n*   **Disenfranchisement and Unaccounted Ballots:** \"If a voter loses a ballot paper they cannot receive a second one.\" (Page 56). This policy directly disenfranchises a voter who may have accidentally dropped or had their ballot stolen, without any mechanism to verify their claim or issue a replacement, while simultaneously leaving a \"lost\" ballot unaccounted for, creating a potential vector for fraud if that lost ballot is later misused.\n\n**Damning Implications from the Prematurely Opened Ballot Box Policy and SOP:**\n\n*   **Deliberate Concealment of Breaches:** The most egregious failure is the explicit definitional sleight-of-hand. The policy *narrows* the definition of \"prematurely opened ballot box\" to exclude critical integrity failures (Policy Page 3, Scenario Guide Page 4-5):\n    *   \"Seal on ballot box has broken or appears faulty. -> No\"\n    *   \"Original seal has not been affixed to the ballot box properly. -> No\"\n    *   \"When moving a cardboard ballot box, it splits or comes open, or seal comes off or pulls through cardboard. Ballot papers are not spilt. -> No\"\n    This is not an oversight; it is a **deliberate institutional strategy to minimize the reported incidence of compromised ballot boxes.** By categorizing these incidents as \"normal operations\" rather than \"prematurely opened,\" the AEC avoids the full \"investigation process\" and public transparency, creating a facade of higher integrity than actually exists. It implies widespread issues with the quality of seals and cardboard boxes, and/or widespread incompetence in staff procedures for securing them, which the AEC actively chooses to downplay rather than address fundamentally.\n*   **Subjective and Internal \"Investigation\" Processes:** The AEO (Australian Electoral Officer) has the sole authority to determine if ballots from a prematurely opened box are \"fraudulently altered or otherwise interfered with so as not to reflect the voter\u2019s intention.\" (SOP Page 4). This subjective standard, applied by an internal official, places a high bar for exclusion, meaning any accidental contamination, non-malicious interference, or damage not provably \"fraudulent\" will likely still be counted. This process lacks independent oversight and transparency, allowing potentially compromised votes to be validated internally.\n*   **Bureaucratic Prioritization Over Safety:** In a COVID-19 scenario where a voter spits on a ballot paper and places it in the box, the instruction is to \"ensure the incident is recorded and call the DRO. Extra precautions must be taken during the scrutiny. Instruct all officials involved in the count to wear gloves, regularly sanitise their hands and not touch their faces.\" (Page 99). This means the AEC **knowingly allows bio-hazardous material to remain in the ballot box** and exposes its staff to risk during the count, rather than having a procedure to immediately isolate or remove compromised ballots, demonstrating a profound disregard for staff safety in favor of processing all votes.\n\nIn summary, the documents paint a picture of an electoral commission that prioritizes the *appearance* of integrity and the *expediency* of results over robust, independently verifiable security and accountability. There are explicit policies that allow for ballot boxes to be physically compromised without triggering a full investigation, tolerate fundamental counting errors, create pathways for undue influence on voters, and even expose staff to bio-hazards, all while maintaining a facade of being \"one of the fairest and most open\" systems globally. The failure to provide the requested data on \"foreign objects\" is a glaring testament to this culture of opacity and managed perception over genuine transparency.", "model": "gemini-2.5-flash", "generated_at": "2025-06-22T14:08:14.118736", "source_hash": "dbeebf23922d63a5a4a080683b47e71f2bcab23cd92c4e3f39a45eddcaf30d34", "raw_response_path": "data/llm_responses/LEX3041__overall__highly_critical__20250622T140814.json", "output_tokens": 1933, "prompt_tokens": 66082, "total_tokens": 71312, "summary_length": 9449}, "short_index": {"text": "The FOI response itself immediately reveals the Australian Electoral Commission's profound lack of transparency and competence, completely ignoring the core request for a list of foreign objects in ballot boxes and instead offering procedural handbooks that expose a system prioritizing the *appearance* of integrity and the *expediency* of results over genuine security and accountability.
