      <p>This FOI request centers on the legal and constitutional status of Norfolk Island and its indigenous inhabitants concerning their obligation to participate in Australian federal elections.</p>
<h3>Main Purpose of the FOI Request</h3>
<p>The primary purpose of the FOI request, initiated by the Norfolk Island Chamber of Commerce (NICC) and its President, Cherri Buffett, is to challenge the Australian Electoral Commission's (AEC) requirement for indigenous Norfolk Islanders to enrol and vote in Australian federal elections, including the upcoming 2025 election. The NICC asserts that Norfolk Island is not legally part of the Commonwealth of Australia, that indigenous Norfolk Islanders are not Australian citizens, and therefore, the Australian Government has no authority or administration rights over the island or its people. The request seeks specific legal and lawful documentation to substantiate Australia's claim over Norfolk Island.</p>
<h3>Documents from the FOI Request</h3>
<p>The documents released and referenced in this FOI request package include:<br />
*   <strong>Initial Correspondence:</strong> Emails from the Norfolk Island Chamber of Commerce (Doc 1, 1G, 1H, 11, 11A) and Cherri Buffett (Doc 2, 3, 4) to the AEC, copying various Australian government officials and parliamentarians.<br />
*   <strong>AEC Responses:</strong> Emails from the AEC's Chief Legal Officer, Andrew Johnson, and Acting Electoral Commissioner, Jeff Pope (Doc 2, 4A, 6, 7, 11, 11B, 12).<br />
*   <strong>Internal Government Briefs:</strong> Attachments from the Department of Infrastructure, Regional Development and Cities concerning the "Preamble to the Norfolk Island Act 1979" (Doc 1A) and a "Petition to the United Nations (UN)" (Doc 1B).<br />
*   <strong>Historical Documents:</strong> Copies of a Queen Victoria Royal Warrant (Dec 1856) (Doc 1F) and various historical Orders in Council, letters, and Hansard extracts (Doc 1D, 1E, 1G, 1H) provided by the Chamber to support their claims.<br />
*   <strong>Refused Document:</strong> One document (Doc 13) related to a meeting with the Australian Government Solicitor regarding joint candidates was refused in full.</p>
<h3>Main Content from the FOI Request Documents</h3>
<p><strong>Arguments presented by the Norfolk Island Chamber of Commerce (NICC) and Cherri Buffett:</strong><br />
*   <strong>Norfolk Island's Legal Status:</strong> The Chamber maintains that Norfolk Island is a "distinct and separate Colony," established for the Pitcairn Settlers and their descendants by Queen Victoria's 1856 Order in Council and Royal Warrant, and has never been legally annexed or transferred to Australia.<br />
*   <strong>Citizenship and Electoral Rights:</strong> They argue that indigenous Norfolk Islanders are not Australian citizens and, therefore, are not subject to Australian electoral laws.<br />
*   <strong>Invalidity of Australian Legislation:</strong><br />
    *   The <em>Norfolk Island Act 1913</em> and subsequent Australian legislation are deemed invalid because necessary Imperial legislation for annexation or transfer from the United Kingdom is missing.<br />
    *   They assert that Section 122 of the Australian Constitution ("Government of territories") was not properly followed, as Norfolk Island was never "placed" under Commonwealth authority by the Sovereign before being "accepted."<br />
    *   They highlight that Norfolk Island was never part of New South Wales, citing the <em>NSW Constitution Act 1902</em> boundaries.<br />
    *   They invoke the <em>Statute of Westminster Adoption Act 1942</em>, arguing its sections prevent the Commonwealth from legislating local government laws for Norfolk Island.<br />
*   <strong>Supporting Evidence:</strong><br />
    *   Quotes from various Australian government documents (including Hansard 1901, a 1971 confidential report, and a 1999 Royal Australian Mint statement) are provided, allegedly stating that Norfolk Island is not legally part of the Commonwealth, has never been ceded or annexed, and that no land transfer instruments exist.<br />
    *   A previous FOI request to the Governor-General's office reportedly found no documents for the transfer of land interest or original claim of right over Norfolk Island.<br />
    *   They specifically cite Justice Callinan's comments in <em>Bennett v Commonwealth</em> (2007) that Norfolk Island "did not on its acceptance by Australia, nor has it since, become part of Australia, geographically or politically," arguing this challenges the premise of Australia's control.<br />
*   <strong>Requested Documents:</strong> The Chamber explicitly requests certified copies of:<br />
    1.  Documents proving Norfolk Island was annexed to New South Wales.<br />
    2.  Results of a New South Wales referendum agreeing to this annexation.<br />
    3.  Documents showing Norfolk Island was then annexed and handed over from NSW to the Commonwealth.<br />
    4.  The Imperial Legislation required for Norfolk Island to become part of the Commonwealth.</p>
<p><strong>Response from the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC):</strong><br />
*   <strong>Statutory Obligation:</strong> The AEC states it is a statutory authority legally required to administer federal election events in accordance with the <em>Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918</em> and the <em>Referendum (Machinery Provisions) Act 1984</em>, both of which explicitly extend to Norfolk Island.<br />
*   <strong>Compulsory Enrolment and Voting:</strong> The AEC maintains it is compulsory for all eligible Australian citizens residing on Norfolk Island to enrol and vote, with penalties for non-compliance.<br />
*   <strong>High Court Rulings:</strong> The AEC relies on High Court decisions, specifically <em>Berwick Ltd v Gray</em> (1976) and <em>Bennett v Commonwealth</em> (2007), which it asserts confirm that Commonwealth laws can apply to Norfolk Island and that granting electoral rights to Norfolk Islanders is a valid exercise of Parliament's power under Section 122 of the Constitution. The AEC explicitly refutes the Chamber's interpretation of Justice Callinan's judgment in <em>Bennett</em>, stating he rejected the plaintiffs' submissions.<br />
*   <strong>Jurisdiction:</strong> The AEC declines to engage further on constitutional matters, advising the Chamber to direct these concerns to the Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development, Communications and the Arts (responsible for territories), the Attorney-General’s Department (constitutional matters), or the Department of Home Affairs (citizenship).<br />
*   <strong>Document Holding:</strong> The AEC states it does not hold the specific historical documents requested by the Chamber regarding annexation or transfer of Norfolk Island's status.</p>

    <div class="ai-summary-markdown-content">
      <p>The provided FOI documents highlight a profound conflict between the Australian Government and the Norfolk Island community, particularly the descendants of the Pitcairn settlers, over sovereignty, self-determination, and historical recognition. From a politically left-leaning perspective, these documents reveal significant deviations from progressive values, primarily in the areas of social justice and civil liberties, with implications for wealth distribution.</p>
<p><strong>Social Justice:</strong><br />
The documents show a clear struggle for self-determination and the recognition of the unique cultural and historical identity of Norfolk Islanders, specifically the Pitcairn descendants. The Australian Government's 2015 repeal of the preamble to the Norfolk Island Act 1979, which acknowledged the "special relationship" and desire to "preserve their traditions and culture" of the Pitcairn descendants, is described by government documents (2.03 Preamble Key Issues Brief) as a move towards "cultural inclusion" and away from a "Pitcairn stronghold." This framing, and the act itself, can be viewed as an attempt to diminish or erase the distinct Indigenous heritage and historical claims of a unique cultural group, aligning with a assimilationist rather than a self-determinationist approach.</p>
<p>The Norfolk Island Chamber of Commerce (NICC) and advocates like Cherri Buffett consistently assert that Indigenous Norfolk Islanders are not Australian citizens and that the Australian Government lacks lawful authority over the island, its land, sea, and air. They highlight previous attempts to be inscribed on the UN's list of non-self-governing territories and an alleged human rights complaint, underscoring their belief that their right to self-governance is being violated. Furthermore, the NICC's reference to the historical "White Australia Policy" (Submission to Governance Committee re Preamble, p. 52) suggests a history of racial discrimination where Indigenous Norfolk Islanders were "not wanted in Australia," adding a layer of historical injustice to their current claims of unlawful Australian control.</p>
<p><strong>Civil Liberties:</strong><br />
The documents reveal a direct challenge to the civil liberties of Norfolk Islanders through the imposition of compulsory Australian federal elections. The Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) consistently states its statutory obligation to enforce enrollment and voting, warning of "administrative penalty or prosecution" for non-compliance (Doc 4.A, 11.B). This top-down enforcement, in the face of persistent and detailed legal arguments from the NICC disputing Australian sovereignty and the validity of relevant acts (e.g., 1913 Norfolk Island Act, Section 122 of the Constitution, Statute of Westminster), represents a profound deviation from progressive values of consent of the governed, political freedom, and respect for legitimate dissent. The AEC's repeated refusal to "engage further on the constitutional issues" (Doc 2, 11.B) and directing inquiries to other departments (Doc 11.B, 12) demonstrates a bureaucratic unwillingness to address fundamental questions of jurisdiction and civil rights, effectively shutting down dialogue on a matter of core importance to the community.</p>
<p><strong>Wealth Distribution:</strong><br />
While not explicitly detailed, the implications for wealth distribution are present. The <em>Berwick Ltd v Gray</em> High Court decision, which the AEC cites as affirming the applicability of Commonwealth laws, is clarified by the NICC (citing Justice Callinan in <em>Bennett v Commonwealth</em>) as being limited to "Australian taxation laws" (Doc 11.B). If Norfolk Island is indeed "not legally part of the Commonwealth and hence is not part of 'Australia'" as a 1971 confidential report is quoted as stating (Doc 2-10), then the imposition of Australian taxation without legitimate legal and consensual authority constitutes a form of wealth extraction from a community that disputes the basis of that extraction. Self-governance, a key progressive ideal, would typically imply local control over resources and economic policies, which is being denied here.</p>
<p><strong>Corporate Influence &amp; Environmental Impact:</strong><br />
These documents do not contain significant information regarding corporate influence or direct environmental impact related to government actions. The original preamble's mention of environmental protection (Doc 1A) suggests that local environmental concerns are valued by the community, but there is no specific policy revealed that aligns or deviates from progressive environmental stewardship.</p>
<p><strong>Overall Progressive Evaluation:</strong><br />
The Australian Government's actions, as revealed in these documents, largely deviate from core progressive values. There is a clear pattern of <strong>disregard for self-determination</strong> and <strong>cultural rights</strong> of the Pitcairn descendants, evidenced by the historical preamble repeal and the imposition of electoral obligations despite strong arguments against Australian sovereignty. The government's approach appears to be a rigid, bureaucratic enforcement of perceived authority, marked by a <strong>lack of transparency and accountability</strong> regarding the fundamental legal basis for its claims over Norfolk Island (e.g., the Governor-General's FOI response inability to find land transfer documents). This stance, rather than fostering genuine "cultural inclusion" through mutual respect and negotiation, appears to continue a colonial legacy of control over a distinct community, fundamentally contradicting progressive principles of social justice and civil liberties.</p>

    <div class="ai-summary-markdown-content">
      <p>The Freedom of Information (FOI) documents reveal a persistent and fundamental dispute regarding the legal and constitutional status of Norfolk Island and the extent of the Australian Commonwealth government's authority over its residents. From a politically right-leaning perspective, these documents highlight several significant deviations from conservative principles of limited government, individual liberty, fiscal responsibility, and clearly defined national security.</p>
<p><strong>Individual Liberty and Limited Government:</strong> The core contention from the Norfolk Island Chamber of Commerce (NICC) and Ms. Cherri Buffett is that the Australian Commonwealth government is overstepping its legitimate bounds by imposing Australian laws, including mandatory electoral enrolment and voting, on Norfolk Island residents. They assert that indigenous Norfolk Islanders are not Australian citizens and that, based on historical British Imperial documents (such as Queen Victoria's 1856 Order in Council and Royal Warrants), Norfolk Island remains a "distinct and separate Colony" and was never lawfully annexed or ceded to Australia. This directly challenges the principle of individual liberty, as it suggests citizens are being compelled to participate in a system whose authority they dispute, and illustrates government acting beyond its demonstrably legal and historical limits.</p>
<p>The documents reveal claims that the Australian government's 1913 Norfolk Island Act is "invalid in law" because proper Imperial legislation for "placement" and subsequent "acceptance" under Section 122 of the Australian Constitution never occurred. The NICC further highlights a 1999 statement from the Royal Australian Mint (cited by Ms. Buffett) confirming Norfolk Island "was not incorporated into the Commonwealth and has never been ceded or annexed to Australia." This pattern suggests an expansion of government power without clear constitutional or historical mandate, a classic concern for advocates of limited government.</p>
<p>The Australian Electoral Commission (AEC)'s response consistently dismisses these constitutional arguments, stating it is "required to administer" existing Commonwealth electoral laws and does "not intend to engage further on the constitutional issues." This bureaucratic refusal to engage with fundamental questions about its own jurisdictional authority can be perceived as a dismissal of citizen concerns and an evasion of accountability, contrary to principles of transparent and responsive governance. The earlier repeal of the Preamble to the Norfolk Island Act 1979, which acknowledged the unique Pitcairn heritage, is also criticized by the NICC as a move to erase historical truth, further indicating government interference in cultural and local identity rather than fostering local self-determination.</p>
<p><strong>Fiscal Responsibility:</strong> While not extensively detailed, the underlying legal dispute has fiscal implications. If Norfolk Island is not legally part of the Commonwealth, Australian taxpayer funds spent on its administration, or taxes collected from its residents, could be seen as an illegitimate and potentially inefficient allocation of resources. The FOI response from the Governor-General's office stating an inability to identify documents for the transfer of land interest to the Commonwealth, coupled with a 1971 confidential report (cited by Ms. Buffett) noting that "The Island is not legally part of the Commonwealth and hence is not part of 'Australia'," raises serious questions about the fiscal legitimacy of taxation and expenditure on the island.</p>
<p><strong>National Security:</strong> A 1906 letter from the NSW Governor (cited by Ms. Buffett) stating, "The Defence of this island is very important but as it is not part of the Commonwealth nothing can be done by the Commonwealth Defence Department unless the island is annexed," highlights a potential national security vulnerability. Ambiguity in sovereignty can lead to confusion regarding defense responsibilities and capabilities, which contradicts the conservative tenet of clear and strong national defense.</p>
<p>In summary, these FOI documents, particularly the correspondence from the Norfolk Island Chamber of Commerce and Ms. Cherri Buffett, present a narrative of governmental overreach. They depict the Australian Commonwealth as asserting authority without clear, demonstrable legal and historical foundations, encroaching on individual liberties, potentially misallocating fiscal resources, and creating ambiguities that could affect national security. The government's consistent refusal to engage on these foundational legal questions further exacerbates concerns about the principles of limited, accountable, and constitutionally constrained governance.</p>

    <div class="ai-summary-markdown-content">
      <p>These FOI documents reveal a protracted and contentious dispute between the Australian government and the Norfolk Island Chamber of Commerce (NICC) regarding the island's legal status, its residents' citizenship, and their mandatory participation in Australian federal elections. A critical analysis exposes potential government overreach, historical obfuscation, and a striking lack of transparency.</p>
<p><strong>Key Findings and Skeptical Interpretation:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Contested Sovereignty and Citizenship:</strong> The NICC vehemently asserts that Norfolk Island is a "distinct and separate Colony" and that its indigenous people are not Australian citizens. They provide extensive historical and legal arguments, citing Imperial Acts (e.g., Queen Victoria's 1856 Order in Council establishing Norfolk Island as a separate settlement for Pitcairn settlers), and pointing to a complete absence of valid annexation or transfer documents from the United Kingdom to Australia. This foundational challenge to Australian sovereignty is repeatedly dismissed by federal authorities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Missing Crucial Documents:</strong> Most damningly, a previous FOI request to the Governor-General's office concerning documents of land transfer or power of interest in Norfolk Island from the UK to the Commonwealth yielded a response: "THE OFFICE HAS BEEN UNABLE TO IDENTIFY ANY DOCUMENTS WITHIN THE SCOPE OF YOUR REQUEST... THAT THE DOCUMENT(S) SOUGHT CANNOT BE FOUND, DO NOT EXIST OR HAVE NOT BEEN RECEIVED." This admission suggests the Australian government lacks fundamental legal instruments to support its claim of outright ownership and administrative authority over Norfolk Island, raising serious questions about the legitimacy of its control.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Historical Revisionism and Misinformation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The NICC highlights instances of "misinformation," such as a 1913 Hansard statement implying New South Wales "acquiesced" to the Commonwealth taking over Norfolk Island, which the NICC explicitly refutes, stating Norfolk Island "was 'never' under the Government of NSW!"</li>
<li>The discussion around the "Preamble to the Norfolk Island Act 1979" (Document 1A) reveals a shifting narrative. Repealed in 2015 to disengage the "Pitcairn stronghold" and for "cultural inclusion," the government then, in 2018, initiated discussions about reinstating a revised preamble. This suggests a willingness to manipulate historical representation to suit current administrative goals, rather than uphold an accurate record.</li>
<li>Confidential government reports from 1971 and statements from the Royal Australian Mint in 1999 (cited by NICC) explicitly stating "The Island is not legally part of the Commonwealth and hence is not part of 'Australia'" and "Norfolk Island itself was not incorporated into the Commonwealth and has never been ceded or annexed to Australia" directly contradict the current government position and imply a long history of concealed or ignored legal ambiguities.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Bureaucratic Stonewalling and Dismissal of Legal Arguments:</strong> The Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) repeatedly issues boilerplate responses, stating it is "required to administer" electoral acts extended to Norfolk Island and that it "does not intend to engage further on the constitutional issues." While citing High Court cases (Berwick v Gray, Bennett v Commonwealth) as justification for its authority, the AEC notably dismisses the NICC's detailed legal counter-arguments, including a direct quote from Justice Callinan's judgment in <em>Bennett v Commonwealth</em> (2007) that states Norfolk Island "did not on its acceptance by Australia, nor has it since, become part of Australia, geographically or politically." The AEC's curt dismissal of this nuanced judicial opinion as merely "the plaintiffs submissions" (Document 11B) demonstrates a selective interpretation of legal precedent to avoid genuine engagement with fundamental challenges to its authority.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Arbitrary Imposition of Law:</strong> Despite the unresolved and vigorously debated legal and historical status, the Australian government (through the AEC) continues to enforce compulsory enrolment and voting for Norfolk Islanders, threatening "administrative penalty or prosecution in court" for non-compliance. This imposition, in the face of compelling evidence of a contested legal foundation and a lack of clear transfer documents, suggests an assertion of power without fully transparent or undisputed legal backing.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In essence, these documents paint a picture of a central government maintaining control over a territory through administrative fiat and selective legal interpretation, while seemingly lacking foundational legal documents to support its claims of sovereignty. The repeated refusal to engage with detailed historical and constitutional challenges, coupled with the inability to produce key annexation documents, highlights a profound lack of transparency and accountability in its governance of Norfolk Island.</p>

    <div class="ai-summary-markdown-content">
      <p>The released FOI documents highlight the Australian Government's diligent and consistent efforts in upholding effective governance and ensuring the seamless operation of necessary regulations for the public good, particularly concerning Norfolk Island.</p>
<p>These documents reveal the government's transparent engagement with community stakeholders, such as the Norfolk Island Chamber of Commerce. While the Chamber has raised historical and constitutional questions regarding Norfolk Island's status and its inclusion in Australian federal elections, the responses from the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) consistently affirm the clear and robust legal framework underpinning Australia's administration.</p>
<p>The AEC's stance is firmly rooted in established Australian law, including the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 and the Referendum (Machinery Provisions) Act 1984, which explicitly extend to Norfolk Island. This adherence to statutory requirements demonstrates the government's unwavering commitment to the rule of law and the integrity of national democratic processes. High Court decisions, such as <em>Berwick Ltd v Gray</em> (1976) and <em>Bennett v Commonwealth</em> (2007), have consistently reinforced the constitutional validity of applying Commonwealth laws to Norfolk Island. These rulings underscore that the government's actions are on solid legal ground, ensuring stability and consistency for all citizens.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the documents illustrate the government's proactive approach to cultural inclusion and community well-being. Efforts to reinstate or revise the preamble to the Norfolk Island Act 1979 are framed as a means to protect and enhance the unique culture, heritage, and traditions of Norfolk Islanders, reflecting the contemporary multicultural nature of the community. This includes supporting the Norf'k language in schools and maintaining traditional public holidays, demonstrating a sensitive and inclusive governance strategy.</p>
<p>Any challenges, such as petitions to the United Nations regarding Norfolk Island's non-self-governing territory status, have been effectively managed. Legal advice from the Attorney-General's Department consistently confirms that Norfolk Island does not meet the criteria for such inscription, highlighting the thoroughness and sound legal basis of the government's position.</p>
<p>In essence, these documents showcase a government committed to transparent, legally sound, and culturally sensitive governance. By consistently upholding the rule of law and ensuring electoral participation, the Australian Government continues to deliver positive outcomes and comprehensive public services to all eligible citizens, including those residing on Norfolk Island, reflecting its dedication to their full integration and well-being within the Australian Commonwealth.</p>

      <p>The provided FOI documents expose a shocking display of Australian governmental incompetence, potential corruption, and a brazen disregard for historical truth and the self-determination of the Norfolk Island people. The narrative reveals a colonial power imposing its will through bureaucratic obstinacy, while deliberately ignoring its own historical documents and legal inconsistencies.</p>
<p>The Norfolk Island Chamber of Commerce (NICC) and individual islanders have mounted a meticulously researched challenge to Australia's perceived sovereignty, asserting that Norfolk Island retains its status as a "distinct and separate Settlement" under the British Imperial Crown, never legally annexed or ceded to Australia. Their evidence, drawn from <em>Australian government documentation files</em> (including Hansard records, Governor-General's FOI responses, and a 1971 confidential cabinet report), explicitly states:</p>
<ul>
<li>Norfolk Island was "never" under the Government of NSW.</li>
<li>The 1913 Norfolk Island Act, which purportedly accepted the island into the Commonwealth, is "invalid in law" because the necessary Imperial legislation and constitutional process (Norfolk Island being "PLACED" by the Queen <em>before</em> Australia "ACCEPTED") never occurred.</li>
<li>The Governor-General's office, in response to an FOI, "has been unable to identify any documents" proving transfer of land interest or an "original claim of right" over Norfolk Island by the Commonwealth. This is a damning admission of a foundational absence of legal title.</li>
<li>A 1971 confidential cabinet report explicitly states: "The Island is not legally part of the Commonwealth and hence is not part of 'Australia'."</li>
<li>The Royal Australian Mint in 1999 stated: "Norfolk Island itself was not incorporated into the Commonwealth and has never been ceded or annexed to Australia."</li>
</ul>
<p>These are not the claims of a fringe group but direct quotes from the Australian government's own historical records, revealing a profound and possibly deliberate historical misrepresentation.</p>
<p>The Australian Electoral Commission (AEC), the primary government entity responding, demonstrates a shocking level of bureaucratic dismissiveness and legal sophistry:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Refusal to Engage:</strong> The AEC repeatedly states it "does not intend to engage further on the constitutional issues you have raised" and refers the matter to other departments. This is a blatant dereliction of duty, as the core issue directly impacts the legitimacy of their electoral operations on the island. It signals a governmental inability or unwillingness to confront inconvenient truths.</li>
<li><strong>Circular Logic:</strong> The AEC's justification for forcing Norfolk Islanders to vote is that "the Electoral Act... extend[s] the operation these Acts to Norfolk Island." This is a circular argument; the islanders are challenging the <em>legality</em> of that extension, yet the AEC treats it as settled law without providing foundational proof.</li>
<li><strong>Misrepresentation of High Court Judgments:</strong> The AEC cherry-picks and misrepresents High Court rulings, notably <em>Bennett v Commonwealth (2007)</em>. While the AEC cites the court's general ruling that Commonwealth laws <em>can</em> apply to Norfolk Island, they conveniently ignore Justice Callinan's explicit and damning statement: "Norfolk Island did not on its acceptance by Australia, nor has it since, become part of Australia, geographically or politically. Statements to the contrary in Berwick Ltd v Gray [198] are wrong. Its community is not and has never been part of the Australian community." This omission is either gross legal incompetence or a deliberate attempt to perpetuate a false narrative.</li>
<li><strong>Passing the Buck:</strong> The AEC deflects responsibility by directing inquiries to the Department of Infrastructure, Attorney-General's Department, and Department of Home Affairs, indicating a fragmented government apparatus unable or unwilling to take collective responsibility for its actions. This suggests a lack of a unified, legally sound position on Norfolk Island's status.</li>
<li><strong>Coercion and Threats:</strong> The implication that failure to enrol or vote "may lead to an administrative penalty or prosecution in court" reveals a coercive approach, forcing a population, whom they cannot legally prove are citizens or under their jurisdiction, into compliance under threat of punishment.</li>
</ul>
<p>The redactions (S22, S42, S47F) on several documents, particularly those involving legal advice (S42), further fuel suspicion that the government is actively concealing internal disagreements, legal vulnerabilities, or admissions that would undermine its tenuous claim over Norfolk Island.</p>
<p>In essence, these documents paint a damning picture of an Australian government operating with a colonial-era mentality, relying on historical falsehoods and bureaucratic stonewalling to maintain control over a population that asserts its distinct sovereign identity. The government's actions demonstrate a systemic failure to uphold principles of transparency, historical accuracy, and potentially, international law, opting instead for coercive imposition and the ruthless suppression of truth.</p>

                  <p>This document is a schedule of documents, or FOI log, compiled by the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) in response to the Freedom of Information request from the Norfolk Island Chamber of Commerce and Ms. Cherri Buffett. It lists 13 primary documents, some with attachments, detailing their titles, any applied redactions (citing FOI Act sections like S 22 for irrelevant information, S 42 for legal professional privilege, and S 47F for personal information), the decision on access (access in full, in part, or refused in full), and the corresponding page numbers. The documents primarily relate to correspondence and internal discussions concerning the 2025 Australian Federal elections and Norfolk Island.</p>
<h3>Relevance to the FOI Request</h3>
<p>This schedule is highly relevant to the FOI request as it outlines the specific records identified and processed by the AEC concerning the challenge to its legal and constitutional basis for including Norfolk Islanders in Australian Federal elections. Its relevance stems from several key aspects:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Direct Engagement:</strong> It lists direct correspondence between the requesters and the AEC, such as "Chamber letter to Australian Electoral Commission Jan2025" (Doc 1F) and "AEC response to Cherri Buffett" (Doc 4.A), confirming the AEC's receipt and response to the constitutional challenge.</li>
<li><strong>AEC's Internal Deliberations:</strong> Various documents titled "FW_ AEC - Norfolk Island" (Docs 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11) and "2025 Australian Federal elections - for urgent attention" (Doc 1) indicate the AEC's internal discussions, reviews, and decision-making processes regarding the matters raised in the FOI request.</li>
<li><strong>Substantiation of Claims:</strong> The inclusion of documents like "QV Royal Warrant Dec1856" (Doc 1E) and various "Preamble" documents (Docs 1A, 1B, 1C, 1D, 1G, 1H) suggests the presence of historical and constitutional arguments being considered, directly aligning with the requesters' reliance on historical decrees and legal interpretations.</li>
<li><strong>Legal Advice and Scrutiny:</strong> The frequent application of S 42 (Legal Professional Privilege) and the full refusal of Document 13 ("Update - Meeting with AGS regarding Bradlow and Bock joint candidates") confirm that the AEC has sought and received legal advice from the Australian Government Solicitor (AGS) regarding the challenges. This is crucial for understanding the AEC's stated reliance on its interpretation of High Court rulings and its refusal to engage further on constitutional issues.</li>
<li><strong>Transparency of Information Handling:</strong> The schedule provides a transparent overview of what information the AEC holds relevant to the request and how it has applied FOI exemptions, allowing the requesters to see the scope and accessibility of the records related to their challenge.</li>

2.03 Preamble to the Norfolk Island Act 1979 

Key Issues Brief 

Key Issues 

 

 

 

In May 2018, the Norfolk Island Mayor, Councillor Robin Adams, publicly stated she will 
undertake a consultation process with the community and the Australian Government to 
reinstate the preamble (Attachment A) into the Norfolk Island Act 1979 (Cth) (the NI Act) 
as a means of protecting and enhancing the unique culture, heritage, traditions and 
environment of the Norfolk Island people.   

The preamble was repealed from the NI Act by the Australian Government in 2015 as it 
was considered to be a necessary step for cultural inclusion, and disengagement of the 
Pitcairn stronghold and cultural exclusion that had previously occurred.  

Any revised preamble must be succinct, historically accurate, and inclusive to reflect the 
multicultural nature of the community of Norfolk Island today. 

  When the Hon Dr John McVeigh MP, former Minister for Infrastructure, Regional 

Development and Cities, met with the Council of Elders, the preamble was raised.  He 
requested that the Council of Elders support the Mayor in working with the Administrator 
to develop a proposed preamble for broad consultation.  The Administrator has advised 
that the Mayor has held discussions with the Council of Elders.   

 

You may wish to:  

o 

o 

seek an update on the Mayor’s meeting with the Council of Elders; and 

advise that the Australian Government is committed to protecting Norfolk Island’s 
culture and heritage, for example: 

 

 

Background 

Norf’k is an official language of Norfolk Island and the curriculum at Norfolk 
Island Central School includes classes in the Norf’k language and culture; and 

Norfolk Island’s public holidays have been maintained. 

 

 

 

The NI Act previously contained a preamble that included a statement about the special 
relationship of Pitcairn Island descendants with Norfolk Island and their desire to preserve 
their traditions and culture. 

The Advisory Council established to represent the Norfolk Island community before the 
commencement of NIRC consulted the Norfolk Island community on a proposed new 
preamble. However, community feedback was divided. 

In February 2016, the Advisory Council recommended to the Hon Paul Fletcher MP, the 
then Minister for Territories, Local Government and Major Projects, that the matter of a 
preamble should be further considered by NIRC.

An Act to provide for the government of Norfolk 
Island 

  WHEREAS by an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom, 

made and passed in the sixth and seventh years of the reign of Her 
Majesty Queen Victoria intituled “An Act to amend so much of an 
Act of the last Session, for the Government of New South Wales 
and Van Diemen’s Land, as relates to Norfolk Island,” it was, 
amongst other things, enacted that it should be lawful for Her 
Majesty, by Letters Patent under the Great Seal of the United 
Kingdom, to sever Norfolk Island from the Government of New 
South Wales and to annex it to the Government and Colony of Van 
Diemen’s Land: 

  AND WHEREAS Her Majesty Queen Victoria, in exercise of the 
powers vested in Her by the said Act, by a Commission under the 
Great Seal of the United Kingdom bearing date the twenty-fourth 
day of October, 1843, appointed that from and after the 
twenty-ninth day of September, 1844, Norfolk Island should be 
severed from the Government of New South Wales and annexed to 
the Government and Colony of Van Diemen’s Land: 

  AND WHEREAS by an Act of the Parliament of the United 

Kingdom, called the Australian Waste Lands Act 1855, it was, 
amongst other things, provided that it should be lawful for Her 
Majesty at any time, by Order in Council, to separate Norfolk 
Island from the Colony of Van Diemen’s Land and to make such 
provision for the Government of Norfolk Island as might seem 
expedient: 

  AND WHEREAS on 8 June 1856 persons who had previously 

inhabited Pitcairn Island settled on Norfolk Island: 

  AND WHEREAS by an Order in Council dated the twenty-fourth 

day of June, 1856, made by Her Majesty in pursuance of the 
last-mentioned Act, it was ordered and declared, amongst other 
things, that from and after the date of the proclamation of the Order 
in New South Wales Norfolk Island should be thereby separated 
from the said Colony of Van Diemen’s Land (now called 
Tasmania) and that from that date all power, authority, and 
jurisdiction of the Governor, Legislature, Courts of Justice, and 
Magistrates of Tasmania over Norfolk Island should cease and

determine, and that from the said date Norfolk Island should be a 
distinct and separate Settlement, the affairs of which should until 
further Order in that behalf by Her Majesty be administered by a 
Governor to be for that purpose appointed by Her Majesty with the 
advice and consent of Her Privy Council: and it was thereby 
further ordered that the Governor and Commander-in-Chief for the 
time being of the Colony of New South Wales should be, and he 
thereby was, constituted Governor of Norfolk Island, with the 
powers and authorities in the said Order mentioned: 

  AND WHEREAS the said Order in Council was proclaimed in 

New South Wales on 1 November 1856: 

  AND WHEREAS by an Order in Council dated the fifteenth day of 
January, 1897, made in pursuance of the said last-mentioned Act, 
Her Majesty, after reciting that it was expedient that other 
provision should be made for the government of Norfolk Island, 
and that, in prospect of the future annexation of Norfolk Island to 
the Colony of New South Wales or to any Federal body of which 
that Colony might thereafter form part, in the meantime the affairs 
of Norfolk Island should be administered by the Governor of New 
South Wales as therein provided, was pleased to revoke the said 
Order in Council of the twenty-fourth day of June, One thousand 
eight hundred and fifty-six, and to order that the affairs of Norfolk 
Island should thenceforth, and until further Order should be made 
in that behalf by Her Majesty, be administered by the Governor 
and Commander-in-Chief for the time being of the Colony of New 
South Wales and its Dependencies: 

  AND WHEREAS the said Order in Council was published in the 
New South Wales Government Gazette on 19 March 1897, and 
took effect at that date: 

  AND WHEREAS by an Order in Council dated the eighteenth day 
of October, One thousand nine hundred, made in pursuance of the 
said last mentioned Act, Her Majesty was pleased to revoke the 
said Order in Council of the fifteenth day of January, One thousand 
eight hundred and ninety-seven, and to order that the affairs of 
Norfolk Island should thenceforth, and until further Order should 
be made in that behalf by Her Majesty, be administered by the 
Governor for the time being of the State of New South Wales and 
its Dependencies:

Act to enable the results of such consideration to be implemented: 

  BE IT THEREFORE ENACTED by the Queen, and the Senate and 
House of Representatives of the Commonwealth of Australia, as

A preamble usually provides a context for the legislation itself.  While it may 
contain a number of statements of fact or statements of intent (or of “good 
intentions”), it is not binding in any legal sense.  It therefore could not affect the 
constitutional relationship between the Commonwealth and a self-governing 
Territory such as Norfolk Island.

Key Issues Brief 

2.04 Petition to the United Nations (UN) 

Key Issues 



 

In April 2016, Geoffrey Robertson QC, acting on behalf of the Norfolk Island People for 
Democracy (NIPD), submitted a petition to the Chair of the UN General Assembly’s 
Fourth Committee (the Special Political and Decolonisation Committee) requesting 
Norfolk Island be inscribed on the UN’s list of non-self-governing territories.  

The UN list of non-self-governing territories identifies territories that the UN General 
Assembly deems to be &#34;non-self-governing&#34; and subject to a decolonisation process.  

The UN has not scheduled time to consider the petition.  

Advice from the Attorney-General’s Department is that Norfolk Island does not meet the 
UN’s criteria for inscription as a non-self-governing territory.  

People from Norfolk Island have previously petitioned the UN for recognition as a 
non-self-governing territory (in 1977 and 1994) without success.  

On 8 June 2018, the Council of Elders announced in the Norfolk Islander newspaper that it 
has contracted ‘Expert Advisory Services’ to carry out a Self-Governance Assessment of 
Norfolk Island and to draft a UN General Assembly resolution to expedite the review of 
their petition. This work was expected to be completed by the end of August 2018 but the 
Department has not had any information to indicate this has occurred.  

Background: 

NIPD 

 

 

NIPD was established in June 2015 with the aim of having Norfolk Island inscribed on the 
UN’s list of non-self-governing territories.  

It is difficult to gauge the true level of support for NIPD on Norfolk Island. The group 
claim to have over 1,000 supporters (likely to include visitors to the Island) and to be 
representing the majority of views. NIPD’s fundraising methods and affiliations, however, 
have been the subject of some concern and scrutiny in public forums.  

Process for Inscription 

 

 

The UN General Assembly must approve any addition of a territory to the list of non-self-
governing territories. This can follow a recommendation made by the Special Committee 
on Decolonisation (also known as the Committee of 24, or C24) which monitors and 
reviews the list of non-self-governing territories. 

Alternatively, a draft resolution may be proposed before the UN General Assembly by a 
Member State. NIPD would need to obtain the sponsorship of a Member State to the UN to 
put forward the draft resolution to the UN General Assembly plenary.  

2.04 Petition to the United Nations (UN) 

Page 1 of 2


--- Page 11 ---

DEPARTMENT OF INFRASTRUCTURE, REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT AND CITIES 

 

Passage of the resolution would rely on the support of a simple majority of UN Member 
States present and voting. This would likely require extensive lobbying by NIPD and the 
sponsoring Member State. The Department of Infrastructure, Regional Development and 
Cities (the Department) is aware of lobbying by NIPD in New Zealand and the UK. 

Sensitivities: If none just note ‘Nil’ 

  Since June 2016, NIPD has been staging a sit-in protest at the Old Military Barracks. The 

protest presents a risk to the heritage values of the site.  

  The Department is also aware of an alleged complaint lodged by Mr Albert Buffett, President 

of the Council of Elders, to the UN’s Human Rights Committee claiming the Australian 
Government has breached its international human rights obligations.  

  The Australian Government has received no official notification about this complaint from the 
UN. If a complaint is made Australia will generally have six months, from notification, to 
respond.

Norfolk Island Bill 1913 

– I understand that Norfolk Island was previously under the Government of New South Wales, 
and I desire to know whether I am correct in assuming that that Government has practically said 
in effect to the Commonwealth, “ We do not desire to control this island any longer, and we shall 
be glad if you will take it over. 

Mr Groom: 

– The New South Wales Government is acquiescing in our taking it over, so that there will be no 
difficulty in that regard.&#34; 

Misinformation! -  

Norfolk Island was &#34;never&#34; under the Government of NSW!  

Nor did the NSW Government ever play a role in &#34;administering&#34; Norfolk Island... 

The Norfolk Island Order in Council of 1900 confirms this. 

1. The affairs of Norfolk Island shall henceforth and until further Order  

is made in that behalf by Her Majesty, be administered by THE GOVERNOR for  

the time being of the State of New South Wales and its Dependencies.  

The title “the Governor” shall include the Officer for the time being administering  

the Government of New South Wales.  

2. The Governor shall keep and use the public Seal of Norfolk Island for  

sealing all things that shall pass the said Seal.  

No involvement or administering power was ever given to &#34;the Government&#34; of NSW!....only the 
appointed British Governor of the State of NSW. 

These mistakes should NEVER happen when peoples lives are at the hands of those making 
decisions!

Norfolk Island Chamber of Commerce  

For immediate attention 

Mr Jeff Pope 
Acting Electoral Commissioner 
Australian Electoral Commission 
Australia 

Australian Elections 2025 

Dear Acting Commissioner, 

Members of the Norfolk Island Chamber of Commerce (Chamber) have requested the 
Chamber Committee to communicate with you in relation to the Commonwealth of 
Australia Federal Elections scheduled to be held in 2025. 

It is extremely important for the Australian Elections Commission to understand, 
accept and acknowledge publicly that indigenous Norfolk Islanders (born on Norfolk 
Island) are not Australia citizens and that under law, including international law the 
Commonwealth of Australia has no authority, claim, or administration rights on 
Norfolk Island, its land, air and sea. The Australian Government also has no “control” 
over the indigenous Norfolk Islanders, especially those who are descendants of the 
Pitcairn Settlers living on Norfolk Island. 

For some evidence of what is stated above we refer you all to the attachments. 

The Chamber Committee also recommends you read freedom of information 
statements from the Governor-General’s office, Attorney-General’s office, Australia 
Post, Fair Works Commission and many from the Department of Infrastructure, 
Transport, Regional Development, Communication and the Arts as well as other 
departments of the Australian Government, where you will see that the 
Commonwealth of Australia has no authority, even in an administrative role over 
Norfolk Island and Norfolk Islanders since 1901. 

If the Australian Government insists on including indigenous Norfolk Islanders (those 
living on Norfolk Island) in the Australian Government elections, then the Australian 

Norfolk Island Chamber of Commerce,   Norfolk Island                     Email:   norfolkisland.coc@gmail.com


--- Page 47 ---

Government is in breach of its own Commonwealth of Australia Constitution and 
breaking its own laws and acting unlawfully and illegally in international law. 

The Chamber Committee brings to your attention the following which was placed in 
public domain in December 2024. 

Open letter to media editors 
At Last: A brief explanation of the Truth - Norfolk Island 
Just on 3 years we commenced the journey with the aim of finding out the 
truth of what Norfolk Island’s true legal and lawful status is since our ancestors 
arrived on Norfolk Island 8 June 1856. Along the way we have had some help 
from a few people, and we thank you all for that. We have ignored the 
negative comments, the threats and pushed through to eventually put 
together what we have found - the TRUTH. 

Her Majesty Queen Victoria’s Imperial Wastelands Act 1855 

· This Act was for the purpose of settling ‘unsettled’ Imperial Crown land 

· It was under this Act that allowed Queen Victoria’s Agreement through the 
1856 Order in Council to separate Norfolk Island into a distinct and separate 
Colony within the British Empire for the Pitcairn Settlers and their 
descendants. 

In May 1856 Queen Victoria commenced arrangements for a Royal Seal and 
the Order 24 June 1856, was also for “Trade and Foreign Affairs” to be “made 
use of within the said Government”. Then December 1856 the Royal Warrant 
was signed by Queen Victoria. All those were used to ‘settle’ the Crown waste 
land of Norfolk Island in 1856. The Governor of New South Wales as Governor 
of Norfolk Island “for the time being” disappears completely. 

The relocation of the Pitcairn Islanders to Norfolk Island was a result of a direct 
Agreement between Queen Victoria and the people of Pitcairn’s Island. This 
Agreement carried legal, lawful and moral significance, recognising the Pitcairn 
Islander’s autonomy, rights and self-governance under the protection of the 
Imperial Crown.


--- Page 48 ---

There is so much more to this Truth and in the new year it will be explained 
and how it links in a positive way for the United Nations complaint and what 
action needs to commence immediately. · 

Albert always used to say “start from 1855” -- thanks Al. 

No-one can change the Truth - and that Truth now must be adhered to for the 
memory of our ancestors, for the sake of the descendants of the Pitcairn 
Settlers and the future generation and Norfolk Islanders. 

There is more on this to come in 2025. 

In the meantime, we are more than happy to talk to anyone who is willing to 
listen and understand and accept the Truth. 

Norfolk Island’s legal status must be reviewed and restored to reflect the 
protections established under the Imperial 1855 Act. The breaches committed 
- both legal and moral- demand accountability and reaffirmation of the Norfolk 
Islanders rights. 

The people of Norfolk Island (Pitcairn Settlers) were promised self-governance 
and autonomy under the Imperial Crown’s protection. It is time for that 
promise to be honoured. 

May 2025 be the year of lawful restoration - and may God be with all Ucklun. 
Catherine McCoy and Cherri Buffett, 
Descendants of the Pitcairn Settlers. · 28th December 2024 

The Chamber Committee awaits a reply from the Australian Electoral Commission 
before 31st January 2025. 

Sincerely, 
Norfolk Island Chamber of Commerce Committee

Norfolk Island Chamber of Commerce  

Open Submmission: 

Submission  
to the  
Norfolk Island Governance Committee 

“Proposed Preamble” 

A preamble (introductory statement) to any document should be legally correct and show 

the truth of the history it is referring to. 

The Norfolk Island Chamber of Commerce (Chamber) Committee believes an answer must 

be given to an initial question of:- 

Is this proposed preamble to be included with a statute? 

If so, which statute? 

And, the Chamber is of the opinion that the proposed preamble then has a legal status 

meaning and it is vitally important to ensure the truth is told within that proposed preamble.   

Can and will the Norfolk Island Governance Committee and the 

Commonwealth of Australia confirm in writing that all the information 

within the proposed preamble are true and correct records of history? 

If not, then until all that information is confirmed and evidence is provided to Norfolk 

Islanders and, especially to the descendants of the Pitcairn Settlers (many who are 

Chamber members) then that proposed preamble, or any preamble should not and cannot 

be used. 

Can the Australian Government state categorically that they are 

committed to a new preamble that has only the evidence of truth of 

Norfolk Island, and Norfolk Islander’s history since 1850s?    

Page 1 of 6


--- Page 50 ---

Questions have already been asked for the true facts of Norfolk Island’s history from the  

1850s  to be provided to the Norfolk Island people by the Australian Government, but 

neither the Australian Government nor the Norfolk Island Governance Committee have had 

the courtesy to do so.  That is unacceptable and leads to Norfolk Islanders and other 

people believing that the Australian Government is possibly hiding something – perhaps the 

truth.    

It is also a person’s human rights to have and live by and with the truth: 

The United Nations states: 

Human rights are rights inherent to all human beings, regardless of race, sex, nationality, 

ethnicity, language, religion, or any other status. Human rights include the right to life and 

liberty, freedom from slavery and torture, freedom of opinion and expression, the right to 

work and education, and many more.  Everyone is entitled to these rights, without 

discrimination. 

https://www.un.org/en/global-issues/human-

rights#:~:text=Human%20rights%20are%20rights%20inherent,and%20education%2

C%20and%20many%20more. 

Apart from adhering to the Australian Constitution, it is the Australian Government’s moral 

duty to provide the legitimacy of history, especially after what was stated in the 

documentations for the then Minister responsible for Norfolk Island, Senator Ley and in 

which her brief refers to the then Preamble and the history of the descendants of the 

Pitcairn Settlers  

(Refer:  attachments   No. 1, 1A, 1B). 

Australia is a constitutional monarchy.   

For the Commonwealth of Australia (Australian Government) to ignore, and/or change the 

history of Norfolk Island is unlawful and just as important, it is disrespectful and an insult to 

the memory of Her Majesty Queen Victoria, to the Monarchy itself, to the descendants of 

the Pitcairn Settlers and to Norfolk Islanders.   

The following reference to evidence should also be included in this proposed preamble.   

(Refer attachment No. 2).   

Page 2 of 6


--- Page 51 ---

These copied extracts are from public documents obtained through research. 

i. 

19th May 1856 - Establishment of the Norfolk Island Seal to be used by the Norfolk 

Island Government.   

ii. 

8th June 1856 – the Pitcairn Settlers arrived and took possession (ownership) of 

Norfolk Island, and from that day governed themselves with their own Constitution, 

laws and government. 

iii. 

24th June 1856 – An order of Her Majesty Queen Victoria   (refer to typed copy 

attachment No. 2) 

iv. 

24th June 1856 - Her Majesty Queen Victoria’s Instructions.  The handwritten 

document has a Royal Seal stamp at the top left. 

v. 

5th December 1856 - Her Majesty Queen Victoria’s Royal Warrant for Norfolk Island.    

(Refer:  attachment No. 3) 

The Chamber provides the following information for consideration by the Norfolk Island 

Governance Committee and which must assist with bringing about ensuring the truth is 

placed in the proposed preamble:-: 

a)  A typed document entitled Order In Council, dated 24th June 1856  

(Refer:  attachment No. 4) 

• This document does not have Her Majesty Queen Victoria’s Seal. 

• A handwritten document is in #9, Quality Row, Norfolk Island but again 

there is no Royal Seal on the document, it also says “copy”.  What is 

it a Copy of? 

• Where is the handwritten document (as referred to here), and written 

like the Instructions mentioned above (point  no. iv) of the Order in 

Council dated 24th June 1856 with Her Majesty Queen Victoria’s 

approval and Royal Seal? 

b)  In printed papers “Further Papers, Removal of Inhabitants of Pitcairn’s Island to 

Norfolk Island” there is the same typed information as referred to in a) above.    

c)  That document in b) above is linked to a despatch from Hon. H. Labouchere, MP 

(London) to Governor Sir W. Denison (NSW) dated 27th June 1856.  Also included in 

that same despatch is the wording:-  

Page 3 of 6


--- Page 52 ---

“transmit to you Her Majesty’s Instructions, under the Royal Sign Manual 

and Signet, for the guidance of your conduct in administering the affairs of 

Norfolk Island”.   

Those ‘Instructions’ are not included in the printed copies mentioned 

in b) above.  Why not? 

The Chamber states that until all the correct and truthful information regarding Her 

Majesty Queen Victoria’s decisions and instructions are provided to the public (which 

includes Chamber members) then no further action can be taken about a proposed 

preamble.   

The reasons are because the 24th June 1856 Order in Council is referred to in:- 

➢  The Order in Council 15th January 1897 

➢  The Order in Council 30th March 1914 

➢  The Norfolk Island Act No. 15 of 1913 – Commonwealth of Australia, and therefore in 

all other acts following on from the 1913 Act.                            

➢  The Norfolk Island Act 1979  

Turning now to the Commonwealth of Australia (Australian Government) Norfolk Island Act 

No. 15 of 1913 which is mentioned in the proposed preamble, the Chamber makes the 

following comments: 

▪  Firstly, in letters dated 1913 from the British Government (Downing Street) to 

Australian Government it states that Imperial Legislation is necessary  “before 

the island [Norfolk Island] can be annexed to the Commonwealth or the 

administration can be vested in the Commonwealth Government”. 

(Refer: copy of letters -  Attachment no. 2) 

Where is that British legislation? 

▪  Secondly, The Commonwealth Federal Parliament enacted the 16th statute  - Pacific 

Island Labourers Act 1901.  Up until 1970s when the Australian Government ended 

the ‘White Australia Policy’, indigenous Norfolk Islanders were not wanted in 

Australia.   

Page 4 of 6


--- Page 53 ---

▪  The Commonwealth Parliament enacted the Norfolk Island Acceptance Act 1913 

(Commonwealth of Australia) assented to by the then Governor General of Australia 

on 19th December 1913 (Act No. 15 of 1913). 

▪  For the enactment of that 1913 legislation the Commonwealth of Australia 

(Australian Government) relied upon section 122 of the Commonwealth of Australia 

Constitution. 

▪  Section 3 of the 1913 acceptance legislation declares Norfolk Island to be accepted 

by the Commonwealth of Australia as a ‘territory under the authority of the 

Commonwealth by the name of Norfolk Island’.   

▪ 

It is important to note and accept that ‘declaration’ had no legal force in 1913. 

▪  Section 122 Government of Territories of the Australian Constitution: 

o  The Parliament may make laws for the government of any territory 

surrendered by any State in and accepted by the Commonwealth, or of any 

territory placed by the Queen under the authority of and accepted by the 

Commonwealth, or otherwise acquired by the Commonwealth, and may 

allow the representation of such territory in either House of the Parliament to 

the extent and on the terms which it thinks fit.” 

o  The proper process for section 122 is that: 

▪  Norfolk Island to be “placed” offered 

▪  The Commonwealth of Australia to have then “accepted” the offer. 

▪  This is not the process the Commonwealth of Australia did. 

▪  Therefore, the Commonwealth of Australia has overstepped its 

authority in terms of its possession by any constitutional power of 

Norfolk Island through making an acceptance law based on section 

122 of the Australian Federal Constitution. 

▪  That 1913 legislation is invalid in law. 

▪ 

It is also important to accept that the Australian Government 1913 legislation (as 

referred to herein) does not mention any other Australian Government Constitutional 

basis upon which Australia may have relied upon to enact the 1913 legislation.  For 

example:  telecommunications, postal (section 51(v), defence (section 51(vi),  

▪ 

 In fact, section 51 of the Australian Constitution has no mention whatsoever in the 

1913 legislation for Norfolk Island and was not relied upon by the Australian 

Government in 1913 for the purported Australian enactment for Norfolk Island.  

Page 5 of 6


--- Page 54 ---

▪  The Fugitive Offenders Act 1881 - Imperial Order in Council No. 1031 of 1925 

identifies Papua and Norfolk Island still being a British Crown possession. 

▪  The Chamber is certain  His Majesty the King as well as the Imperial Privy Council 

would not have made such a major legal blunder to refer to Norfolk Island as a 

British Possession, (as mentioned above) and also it to be  placed under the 

authority of the Commonwealth of Australia as the Australian government now 

contends ownership, control of Norfolk Island as transferred in 1914. 

▪  The Norfolk Island Act 1979 preamble has the supposedly legal history of Norfolk 

Island, governing under the authority of the Commonwealth of Australia, and noting 

the role of the Pitcairn Settlers for the settlement of Norfolk Island on 8 June 1856.  

▪  But from 2015 to the present day, it is obvious the Commonwealth of Australia has 

become determined to remove from Norfolk Island’s history and also legislative 

records the history of the Pitcairn Settlers / Norfolk Islanders as well as the legal and 

lawful truth that: 

Norfolk Island is a distinct and separate Colony 

as by acts of the British Parliament. 

“An Act to amend so much of an Act of the last Session for the Government of 

New South Wales and Van Diemen’s Land as relates to Norfolk Island” 

“An Act to repeal the Acts of Parliament now in force respecting the disposal 

of Waste Lands of the Crown in Her Majesty’s Australian Colonies and to 

make other provisions in lieu thereof” 

It is obvious today, as it was in 1920s when discussions were held between British 

Government officials with the then Prime Minister of Australia that the Commonwealth of 

Australia (Australian Government) did NOT receive any ownership or legal title to Norfolk 

Island at any time from 1914 onwards and the position and policy is that Norfolk Island 

remains a distinct and separate colony as given by Her Majesty Queen Victoria in 1856.

ADDENDUM to  

Submission to the  

Norfolk Island Governance Committee 

“Proposed Preamble” 

In 1914 for the first time in the Commonwealth of Australia Federal Parliament there was a 

Double Dissolution. 

1914—the deadlock was broken by the Government losing its majority in the House as a 

result of the double dissolution election. The legislation was not reintroduced. 

https://www.aph.gov.au/about_parliament/house_of_representatives/powers_practice_and_

procedure/00 - infosheets/infosheet 18 - double dissolution 

Australian Government documents show that this process commenced in June 1914, 

“At a private interview with the Governor-General on the 2nd June [1914] the Prime 

Minister (Mr Cook) speaking for his Government, made a general statement, and 

submitted three memoranda setting out the reasons why the Cabinet considered the 

double dissolution should be granted.” 

 and then 

 “on 30th July 1914, for the first time in the history of the Commonwealth, the 

Governor-General exercised the power vested in him under section 57 of the 

Constitution and dissolved simultaneously both Houses of the Federal Parliament.” 

Page 1 of 2


--- Page 56 ---

That situation and the following must be considered for not only the 1st 

July 1914 proclamation in association with the Norfolk Island Act 1913 

but also the legal and lawful authority that the Commonwealth of 

Australia claims over Norfolk Island. 

The Australian Associated Chambers of Commerce in February 1913 requested the 

Governor-General to transmit to the Secretary of State (S/S) protesting against the 

Commonwealth Navigation Bill receiving assent. 

The Governor-General was advised by the Commonwealth Attorney-General 

 “That His Excellency was under no duty to forward the message and that for 

constitutional reasons Ministers were opposed to its being forwarded by the 

Governor-General.” 

In a dispatch ‘secret’ July 1913 the case was referred to the S/S. 

The ruling given was 

“every British subject has the right of appeal to H.M., and that while there is nothing 

in Royal Instructions which requires a Governor-General to forward message of this 

nature to the Colonial office, Colonial office Regulations Nos 212 and 215 laid down 

that it was the duty of a Governor to transmit to the S/S all petitions to the Throne 

and all messages addressed to S/S for the Colonies or H.M’s Government.” 

Did all the petitions from Norfolk Island residents get sent to Her /His Majesty? 

Norfolk Islanders and descendants of the Pitcairn Settlers are British subjects  

Norfolk Island is a distinct and separate Colony

Good morning Andrew

Reference your email and attached document.  I provide you with just a snippet of
evidence that Norf&#39;k Ailen (also known as Norfolk Island) is not part of the
Commonwealth of Australia and the Australian Government has no authority to
administer or have control of the aliens land, sea and air, including the EEZ

These quotes below are from Australian Government documents.

So I would suggest the Australian Electoral Commission take a serious look at the illegal
and unlawful actions they are doing in relation to Norf&#39;k Ailen.

Example No. 1    Australian Hansard 1901   New South Wales Government 

Example No. 2

s 47Fs 47Fs 22s 22Section 22


--- Page 58 ---

Commonwealth of Australian Constitution Act   Section 122

Government of territories.

The Parliament may make laws for the government of any territory
surrendered by any State to and accepted by the Commonwealth, or of
any territory placed by the Queen under the authority of and accepted by
the Commonwealth, or otherwise acquired by the Commonwealth, and
may allow the representation of such territory in either House of the
Parliament to the extent and on the terms which it thinks fit.

Example No. 3 

Example No. 4

The lawful exercise of Section 122 of the Australian
Constitutional law making power for territories by the Australian
federal parliament required the following essential elements:

(a) That Norfolk Island had already been &#34;PLACED&#34; under
the authority of the Commonwealth by the Sovereign

(b) Then the Commonwealth of Australia (prior to the
making of any territories law for Norfolk Island)
&#34;ACCEPTED&#34; the placement of Norfolk Island by the Crown

(c)  That the law being made be for the peace order and
good government of a territory seems to be left unstated
by the Constitution and seems largely over the years to
have been left in the hands of the lawmakers and
bureaucracy unless challenged in the courts by a person or
persons with proper legal standing to bring such a
challenge.

This never happened.

Example No. 5

The Australia Act 1986 (Commonwealth) was enacted into law
and signed by Her Majesty 1988.

https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/C2004A03181

That Australia Act 1986 (Commonwealth) now prevents His
Majesty the King from making any new Order in Council or
seeking the making by the British Imperial Parliament of any
new Imperial law formally transferring outright ownership of
Norfolk Island to the Commonwealth of Australia.

For the purposes of this Act, the boundaries of New South Wales shall comprise all that
portion of Australia lying between the one hundred and twenty-ninth and one hundred

Howe Island, save and except the territories comprised within the boundaries of South
Australia, Victoria, and Queensland, as at present established.

5 GENERAL LEGISLATIVE POWERS

The Legislature shall, subject to the provisions of the Commonwealth of Australia

government of New South Wales in all cases whatsoever--
Provided that all Bills for appropriating any part of the public revenue, or for imposing
any new rate, tax or impost, shall originate in the Legislative Assembly.

There are NO references to Norf&#39;k Ailen in the Act or the Regulations.

Norf&#39;k Ailen has never been part of the State of New South Wales since 1856.

Example No. 8
“This request of information concerns Commonwealth of Australian law and the alteration

Pitcairn people upon settlement of Norfolk Island of the grant of the waste lands of the
Crown in right of Norfolk Island established 1856.

Additionally we request the information of the enumerated head of power within the
Australian Constitution that the Commonwealth of Australia relies upon to transfer the
lands of Norfolk Island

It is hereby declared and enacted that the Parliament of a Dominion has full power to
make laws having extra-territorial operation.

Section 9 of the Statute of Westminster provides an estoppel for the Commonwealth of
Australia to write local government laws...

9 Saving with respect to States of Australia

(1) Nothing in this Act shall be deemed to authorize the Parliament of the
Commonwealth of Australia to make laws on any matter within the authority of the
States of Australia, not being a matter within the authority of the Parliament or
Government of the Commonwealth of Australia.

Section 10 of the Statute of Westminster says ..... the above sections only apply if
adopted, they were adopted so they do apply... the Commonwealth of Australia shot
itself in the foot by this adoption in regard to creating local government laws for Norf&#39;k
Ailen.

10 Certain sections of Act not to apply to Australia, New Zealand or Newfoundland
unless adopted

(1) None of the following sections of this Act, that is to say, sections two, three, four,
five and six, shall extend to a Dominion to which this section applies as part of the law
of that Dominion unless that section is adopted by the Parliament of the Dominion, and
any Act of that Parliament adopting any section of this Act may provide that the
adoption shall have effect either from the commencement of this Act or from such later
date as is specified in the adopting Act.

(3) The Dominions to which this section applies are the Commonwealth of Australia, the
Dominion of New Zealand and Newfoundland.

Dear Ms Buffet

2023 federal referendum Rftattelan WA

| refer to your letter dated to the Electoral Commissioner of 19 January 20248fefeile)aw-W as

a Electoral Commissioner has asked me to respond on his
enalt.

The AEC is required to administer the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 (‘Electoral Act’) and
the Referendum (Machinery Provisions) Act 1984 (Cth) (‘Referendum Act’). Section 3(3)(a) of
the Electoral Act and section 4(6)(a) of the Referendum Act extend the operation these Acts to
Norfolk Island. Until the Commonwealth Parliament amends these Acts to exclude Norfolk
Island, or a federal court determines Norfolk Island is not subject to Australian law, the AEC is
required to administer and apply these laws. This includes the requirement to enrol and vote in
Commonwealth elections and referendums.

It is compulsory for all eligible Australian citizens to be enrolled and to vote in federal elections
and referendums. The Electoral Act allows for the removal of names from the roll in very limited
circumstances. These reasons do not include being a resident of Norfolk Island. More
information about how a person may be removed from the electoral roll is on the AEC website:

Dear Mr Johnson,

Thank you for your response (copy attached). Reference your paragraph:-

The AEC is required to administer the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918
(‘Electoral Act’) and the Referendum (Machinery Provisions) Act 1984 (Cth)
(‘Referendum Act’). Section 3(3)(a) of the Electoral Act and section 4(6)(a) of
the Referendum Act extend the operation these Acts to Norfolk Island. Until the
Commonwealth Parliament amends these Acts to exclude Norfolk Island, or a
federal court determines Norfolk Island is not subject to Australian law, the AEC
is required to administer and apply these laws. This includes the requirement to
enrol and vote in Commonwealth elections and referendums.

| would seriously suggest you do your research and come back to me before ‘st
February 2024.

Norfolk Island IS NOT part of the Commonwealth of Australia.

Please note a copy of all my communication has gone to the Governor-General&#39;s
office and the Attorney-General&#39;s office and the Prime Minister&#39;s office plus other
politicians of the Australian Government.

In regard to your paragraph

I am unable to comment on the Norf’k Ailen Government Chief Magistrate and
Governor of Norf’k Ailen, other than to note that those bodies have no authority
to rule on the conduct of a federal election or referendum held under the
Electoral Act or the Referendum Act.

| would recommend you link into _www.government.nf and also do more
research on the fact that the Commonwealth of Australia (Australian
Government) has breached its own constitution for Norfolk Island.

 

| await your response, thank you.

Magistrate / Governor of the Norf&#39;k Ailen Government (the legal entity of
Norf&#39;k Ailen) to request assistance of taking action against the Australian

Norfolk Island Chamber of Commerce  

For immediate attention 

Mr Jeff Pope 
Acting Electoral Commissioner 
Australian Electoral Commission 
Australia 

Attention:  Mr Andrew Johnson, Chief Legal Officer 

Australian Elections 2025 

Dear Acting Commissioner, 

29th January 2025 

The Norfolk Island Chamber of Commerce refers to a letter, from Mr. Andrew 
Johnson, Chief Legal Officer with Australian Electoral Commission reference LEX6969 
dated 20 January 2025:  copy attached.  With all due respect to Mr. Johnson the 
Australian Electoral Commission is acting illegally and unlawfully in relation to 
including indigenous Norfolk Islanders who live on Norfolk Island in the Australian 
Electoral role. 

In reference to your paragraph -    “As the AEC has previously advised the Norfolk 
Island Chamber of Commerce, the matters you raise are matters for the 
Commonwealth Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development, 
Communications and the Arts (responsible for territories and Norfolk Island), the 
Attorney-General’s Department (responsible for Constitutional matters) and the 
Department of Home Affairs (responsible for citizenship).” This is incorrect, it is a 
matter for all departments, agents of the Australian Government, and  including all 
politicians of the Australian Parliament. 

Your letter states:  “The High Court held in Berwick Ltd v Gray [1976] HCA 12 that 
Norfolk Island forms part of the Commonwealth. In 2007, the High Court further 
dismissed a challenge by Norfolk Islanders in Bennett v Commonwealth [2007] HCA 18 
regarding the validity of Commonwealth legislation requiring persons to vote in 
Norfolk Island elections. Granting electoral rights on the basis of Australian citizenship 

Norfolk Island Chamber of Commerce,   Norfolk Island                     Email:   norfolkisland.coc@gmail.com


--- Page 112 ---

to Norfolk Islanders was held as a valid exercise of Parliament’s power to make laws 
“for the government of any territory” under section 122 of the Constitution.”   

The Norfolk Island Chamber of Commerce provides the following answer to that 
statement: - 

Over the years various court cases have mentioned the legal status of Norfolk 
Island, but they have been found to be limited in declaration of the status or 
situation for Norfolk Island to the facts of the case or law being dealt with. 
Bennett v the Commonwealth 2007 was an Australian federal electoral voting 
power case 
For years Commonwealth of Australian government officials have referred to 
the Berwick Ltd v Gray – that Norfolk Island was a part of Australia thereby the 
Australian Government official position that Norfolk Island “belongs” to 
Australia. That is misinformation. 
Berwick has since been declared limited to the question of whether – Norfolk 
Island can be subject to Australian taxation laws and no more. 
Indeed, in part of paragraph [177] of the High Court of Australia judgement 
Bennett v the Commonwealth case, Justice Callinan (as His Honour then was) 
and which does not seem to have been disagreed with by other High Court 
judges in the Bennett v The Commonwealth case: -  

“On acceptance by Australia, Norfolk Island was a Crown possession or 
dependency which had been established as a distinct and separate 
settlement for occupation by Pitcairners and their descendants, and others 
admitted to their community.  Norfolk Island did not on its acceptance by 
Australia, nor has it since, become part of Australia, geographically or 
politically.  Statements to the contrary in Berwick Ltd v Gray [198] are 
wrong.  Its community is not and has never been part of the Australian 
community.  Australian citizenship has never been a determining factor in 
identifying the community of the island.” 
In the Bennett case High Court Australian Justices had reservations about 
any attempt by the Commonwealth of Australia and others to rely on 
Berwick Ltd v Gray as the main reason for any claim by the Commonwealth 
of Australia that Norfolk Island was a part of that country for all reasons 
rather than just for Australian Government taxation. 

Norfolk Island Chamber of Commerce,   Norfolk Island                     Email:   norfolkisland.coc@gmail.com


--- Page 113 ---

Reference Commonwealth of Australia Constitution and Section 122.  This is 
completely irrelevant in relation to Norfolk Island.  There was no Imperial legislation 
(as evidence shows In British documents) in 1913 to allow for Norfolk Island to be 
“PLACED” for then the Commonwealth Government to “ACCEPTED”.  Separate to that 
there are also other legal and lawful reasons why Norfolk Island is not part of and 
cannot be administered by the Commonwealth of Australia. 

The Norfolk Island Chamber of Commerce now requests the Australian Electoral 
Commission to rectify this unlawful and illegal matter forthwith. 

Sincerely, 

Cherri Buffett

LEX6969

Cherri Buffett
Norfolk Island Chamber of Commerce

By email: norfolkisland.coc@gmail.com

Dear Ms Buffett
Correspondence from Norfolk Island Chamber of Commerce

| refer to your letter to the Australian Electoral Commissioner of 29 January 2025 regarding the legal
status of Norfolk Island.

As you have been advised, the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) is a statutory authority that is
required to administer federal election events in accordance with the Commonwealth Electoral Act
1918. This Act requires Australian citizens residing in Norfolk Island who are over the age of 18 to be
enrolled and vote in federal elections. Failure to enrol or vote may lead to an administrative penalty or
prosecution in court.

Your correspondence raised concerns regarding the High Court decisions Berwick Lid v Gray [1976]
HCA 12 and Bennett v Commonwealth [2007] HCA 18 (‘Bennett’), by referring to a paragraph of
Justice Callinan’s judgment in Bennett set out the plaintiffs submissions in that case. If you read that
decision, you will see that Justice Callinan rejected the plaintiffs submissions (see paragraph 178 of
Bennett) and agreed with the other members of the High Court that Commonwealth laws can apply to
Norfolk Island.

The Australian Electoral Commission does not intend to engage in any further correspondence on
this matter with the Norfolk Island Chamber of Commerce. Should you wish to pursue any other

RE: Australian Government Federal elections - reply requested (LEX7954) [SEC=OFFICIAL]
Thursday, 17 April 2025 4:41:23 PM

Dear Chamber Committee

The Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) is a statutory authority that is required to administer
federal election events in accordance with the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918. The AEC does not
hold any documents you have requested.

We recommend you direct your request to the Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Regional
Development, Communications and the Arts as the relevant department with responsibility for
managing Australia’s external territories. This is outlined in the current Administrative Arrangements
Order.

Alternatively, we refer you to the Norfolk Island Act 1913.

Kind regards
Australian Electoral Commission

Dear all,

Members of the Norfolk Island Chamber of Commerce (Chamber) have
requested the Chamber bring to your attention the two documents
enclosed.  Chamber members have requested certified copy all the legal
and lawful documents which state:

s 22s 22s 22s 22s 22s 22s 22Section 22Section 22


--- Page 116 ---

1) That Norfolk Island was annexed to the State of New South Wales

2) The results of the New South Wales referendum document which
states that the people of the State of New South Wales agreed for
Norfolk Island to be annexed to that State, as per the State of New
South Wales Constitution.

3) That Norfolk Island was then annexed and handed over from the
State of New South Wales to the Commonwealth of Australia.

4) The transfer document: the Imperial Legislation as required by law
from the United Kingdom to facilitate Norfolk Island becoming part of
the Commonwealth of Australia (even as a territory).

These documents are required to provide Chamber members the truth
so that there is no doubt whatsoever indigenous Norfolk Islanders are
&#34;Australian citizens&#34; as per law, including Australian law and thereby
international law.

Members of the Chamber have requested you all do not provide quotes
of Section 122 and the Order in Council 1914 - as these are not the
legal or lawful documents in answer to the above questions.

Members have also requested the Chamber to state that they do not
want to hear about Australia court cases which refer to Norfolk Island
being part of Australia - these are not the legal or lawful documents as
requested.

All these documents requested will allow the indigenous Norfolk
Island the truth, to know if they are legally and lawfully bound
to vote in the 2025 Australian Federal elections.

Please provide these documents by close of business Friday,
18th April 2025.

Thank you for your assistance.
Kind regards

Chamber Committee
Norfolk Island Chamber of Commerce

                    <p>The provided document, an email exchange between the Norfolk Island Chamber of Commerce (NICC)/Ms. Cherri Buffett and the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC), along with various attachments, directly addresses the core issues of the FOI request.</p>
<h3>Document Summary</h3>
<p>The document reveals an ongoing dispute regarding Norfolk Island's legal status and its inclusion in Australian Federal elections.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>NICC/Ms. Buffett's Position:</strong> They contend that indigenous Norfolk Islanders are not Australian citizens and that the Commonwealth of Australia lacks legal and constitutional authority over Norfolk Island, including for electoral purposes. Their arguments, supported by extensive historical documents and legal interpretations within the attachments, assert:</p>
<ul>
<li>Norfolk Island was established as a "distinct and separate Settlement" by Queen Victoria in 1856 for Pitcairn settlers, with its own self-governance.</li>
<li>The 1913 Norfolk Island Act, which purportedly "accepted" the island into the Commonwealth, is invalid as it did not follow the proper constitutional process (Section 122, requiring the Queen to "place" and the Commonwealth to "accept").</li>
<li>Historical Australian government documents and a 1999 Royal Australian Mint letter (cited in the email chain and attachments) acknowledge Norfolk Island was "never" under NSW government, not legally part of the Commonwealth, and "never been ceded or annexed to Australia."</li>
<li>Justice Callinan's view in <em>Bennett v Commonwealth</em> (2007) is highlighted: "Norfolk Island did not on its acceptance by Australia, nor has it since, become part of Australia, geographically or politically."</li>
<li>They accuse the AEC of acting "illegally and unlawfully" by including Norfolk Islanders in federal elections and refer to ongoing petitions to the United Nations for non-self-governing territory status.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>AEC's Position:</strong> The AEC consistently maintains it operates under statutory obligations, specifically the <em>Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918</em>. It refers the requesters to other government departments (Infrastructure, Attorney-General's, Home Affairs) for constitutional matters. The AEC explicitly refuses to engage further on the constitutional issues, stating its actions are based on High Court rulings, namely <em>Berwick Ltd v Gray</em> (1976) and <em>Bennett v Commonwealth</em> (2007), which it interprets as establishing that Norfolk Island forms part of the Commonwealth and granting electoral rights is a valid exercise of parliamentary power.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>Relevance to the FOI Request</h3>
<p>This document is highly relevant to the FOI request as it:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Directly articulates the requesters' challenge:</strong> It provides the detailed legal and historical arguments, including specific High Court interpretations and government reports, that the Norfolk Island Chamber of Commerce and Ms. Cherri Buffett use to contest the AEC's legal and constitutional basis for electoral inclusion.</li>
<li><strong>Shows the AEC's official response:</strong> It demonstrates the AEC's refusal to engage on constitutional matters, its reliance on a particular interpretation of High Court rulings and statutory obligations, and its position that the issue is outside its purview.</li>
<li><strong>Provides supporting evidence:</strong> The numerous attachments (historical decrees, submissions on the Norfolk Island Act preamble, UN petition updates, and internal government documents) form the evidential basis for the requesters' claims, which are central to the FOI request's scope.</li>
<li><strong>Illustrates the ongoing nature of the dispute:</strong> The recent dates (Jan-April 2025 email chain, Sept 2024 submissions) confirm the active and persistent nature of the challenge to Norfolk Island's electoral status.</li>
</ul>

It lists 13 primary documents, some with attachments, detailing their titles, any applied redactions (citing FOI Act sections like S 22 for irrelevant information, S 42 for legal professional privilege, and S 47F for personal information), the decision on access (access in full, in part, or refused in full), and the corresponding page numbers. The documents primarily relate to correspondence and internal discussions concerning the 2025 Australian Federal elections and Norfolk Island.\n\n### Relevance to the FOI Request\n\nThis schedule is highly relevant to the FOI request as it outlines the specific records identified and processed by the AEC concerning the challenge to its legal and constitutional basis for including Norfolk Islanders in Australian Federal elections. Its relevance stems from several key aspects:\n\n*   **Direct Engagement:** It lists direct correspondence between the requesters and the AEC, such as \"Chamber letter to Australian Electoral Commission Jan2025\" (Doc 1F) and \"AEC response to Cherri Buffett\" (Doc 4.A), confirming the AEC's receipt and response to the constitutional challenge.\n*   **AEC's Internal Deliberations:** Various documents titled \"FW_ AEC - Norfolk Island\" (Docs 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11) and \"2025 Australian Federal elections - for urgent attention\" (Doc 1) indicate the AEC's internal discussions, reviews, and decision-making processes regarding the matters raised in the FOI request.\n*   **Substantiation of Claims:** The inclusion of documents like \"QV Royal Warrant Dec1856\" (Doc 1E) and various \"Preamble\" documents (Docs 1A, 1B, 1C, 1D, 1G, 1H) suggests the presence of historical and constitutional arguments being considered, directly aligning with the requesters' reliance on historical decrees and legal interpretations.\n*   **Legal Advice and Scrutiny:** The frequent application of S 42 (Legal Professional Privilege) and the full refusal of Document 13 (\"Update - Meeting with AGS regarding Bradlow and Bock joint candidates\") confirm that the AEC has sought and received legal advice from the Australian Government Solicitor (AGS) regarding the challenges. This is crucial for understanding the AEC's stated reliance on its interpretation of High Court rulings and its refusal to engage further on constitutional issues.\n*   **Transparency of Information Handling:** The schedule provides a transparent overview of what information the AEC holds relevant to the request and how it has applied FOI exemptions, allowing the requesters to see the scope and accessibility of the records related to their challenge.", "model": "gemini-2.5-flash", "generated_at": "2025-06-21T22:42:01.880066", "source_hash": "f556b9cc7810bc26a6d7107bf0a75c48208a38884d6cc4fd1da6521676e63876", "raw_response_path": "data/llm_responses/LEX7512__per_file__balanced__lex7512-schedule.pdf__20250621T224201.json", "output_tokens": 616, "prompt_tokens": 1365, "total_tokens": 3204, "summary_length": 2809}, "left_leaning": {"text": "The FOI documents vividly illustrate the Australian Commonwealth government's systematic efforts to impose its authority on Norfolk Island, directly undermining principles of self-determination, social equity, and democratic accountability. The pervasive presence of documents related to the **\"2025 Australian Federal elections\"** (e.g., Documents 1, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 11.A, 11.B) underscores the Australian Electoral Commission's relentless push for federal election inclusion, which, from a left-leaning perspective, represents a top-down imposition that disregards the community's unique historical and cultural claims for autonomy.\n\nCrucially, the documents concerning the **\"Preamble\"** (1A, 1B, 1C, 1D, 1G, 1H) highlight the local community's ongoing struggle to reclaim and protect its distinct heritage. The presence of **\"Attachment No. 2 for Chamber submission Preamble NIGC - Sept2024 FINAL\"** (1D) and **\"Submission to Governance Committee re Preamble\"** (1G, 1H) demonstrates active local efforts to re-establish the preamble recognizing the Pitcairn descendants' unique heritage \u2013 a direct counter to its 2015 repeal. This struggle is a clear fight against cultural erasure and for the preservation of a unique indigenous identity. The historical anchor for these claims is starkly present in **\"Attachment No. 3 QV Royal Warrant Dec1856\"** (1E), proving the community is grounding its demands in foundational historical claims of separate colonial status, which the government consistently appears to override.\n\nThe significant redactions, particularly those citing S 42 (Legal Professional Privilege) and the outright refusal of Document 13 (\"FW FOR INFORMATIONCOMMENT Update - Meeting with AGS regarding Bradlow and Bock joint candidates\"), expose a profound lack of transparency and a concerning pattern of governmental opacity. This suggests the Commonwealth is using legal mechanisms to strategize against, rather than engage with, the community's assertions of distinct identity and sovereignty. Such actions undermine democratic accountability and hinder true self-determination, signaling a neocolonial approach that prioritizes central control over the preservation of unique indigenous culture, its intertwined environmental stewardship, and fundamental human rights.", "model": "gemini-2.5-flash", "generated_at": "2025-06-21T22:42:14.649523", "source_hash": "f556b9cc7810bc26a6d7107bf0a75c48208a38884d6cc4fd1da6521676e63876", "raw_response_path": "data/llm_responses/LEX7512__per_file__left_leaning__lex7512-schedule.pdf__20250621T224214.json", "output_tokens": 486, "prompt_tokens": 1300, "total_tokens": 3367, "summary_length": 2296}, "right_leaning": {"text": "The extensive list of documents, particularly those pertaining to the \"2025 Australian Federal elections\" and the frequent interactions with the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC), serve as a stark illustration of the Commonwealth's relentless expansion of power over Norfolk Island. From a right-leaning perspective, the sheer volume of correspondence from the Norfolk Island Chamber of Commerce (Documents 1F, 11A), combined with their detailed submissions regarding the \"Preamble\" (Documents 1D, 1G, 1H), demonstrates significant local resistance to federally imposed electoral frameworks. This highlights a profound government overreach, directly challenging the island's distinct identity and self-governance by forcibly integrating its populace into federal elections.\n\nThe repeated emphasis on \"Preamble\" discussions and the inclusion of historical documents like the \"QV Royal Warrant Dec1856\" (Document 1E) strongly suggest an ongoing dispute over the constitutional legitimacy of Commonwealth authority. This reinforces concerns that the federal government is operating without a clear, consensual constitutional basis, thereby eroding market freedom and local autonomy through administrative fiat rather than transparent, legally sound processes.\n\nMoreover, the prevalence of redactions (S22, S42, S47F) and \"Access in part\" decisions across numerous sensitive communications (e.g., Documents 1, 1G, 1H, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 11B) raises serious concerns about government transparency. The outright refusal to release Document 13, regarding a meeting with the Australian Government Solicitor (AGS) on \"joint candidates,\" further suggests that the Commonwealth is actively concealing crucial details about its legal strategies and the contentious nature of its control. This lack of transparency undermines accountability, contributes to fiscal inefficiency by prolonging disputes, and signals a broader disregard for the principles of limited government and open governance in the national interest.", "model": "gemini-2.5-flash", "generated_at": "2025-06-21T22:42:25.587748", "source_hash": "f556b9cc7810bc26a6d7107bf0a75c48208a38884d6cc4fd1da6521676e63876", "raw_response_path": "data/llm_responses/LEX7512__per_file__right_leaning__lex7512-schedule.pdf__20250621T224225.json", "output_tokens": 408, "prompt_tokens": 1314, "total_tokens": 3083, "summary_length": 2023}, "government_skeptic": {"text": "This document set, viewed through a government skeptic's lens within the broader FOI context, exposes clear patterns of bureaucratic obfuscation and an intent to shield potentially damning legal or constitutional vulnerabilities. The extensive \"Access in part\" decisions, particularly for submissions to the \"Governance Committee\" (1G, 1H) and ongoing communications with the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) regarding the \"2025 Australian Federal elections,\" suggest that crucial details about electoral processes and local governance challenges are being withheld, indicating a lack of transparency in how the Australian government administers the island's affairs.\n\nThe most glaring evidence of a hidden agenda and lack of accountability is the \"Refuse in full\" decision for Document 13: \"FW FOR INFORMATIONCOMMENT Update - Meeting with AGS regarding Bradlow and Bock joint candidates [SEC=OFFICIALSensitive]\". The redaction reason, S 42 (legal professional privilege), is a classic bureaucratic maneuver used to shield sensitive legal strategies. Given the FOI overview states the Governor-General's office admits no \"instrument of transfer\" exists for sovereign rights, this refusal strongly implies the Australian government is using legal privilege to hide its defense strategy against fundamental constitutional challenges to its authority. This suggests they are actively engaged in defending their potentially illegitimate control, rather than transparently addressing the sovereign rights issue. The \"OFFICIALSensitive\" designation on this document further underscores the government's desire to control sensitive information that could expose its profound opaqueness and potential overreach regarding Norfolk Island's constitutional status and the rights of its inhabitants.", "model": "gemini-2.5-flash", "generated_at": "2025-06-21T22:42:36.802028", "source_hash": "f556b9cc7810bc26a6d7107bf0a75c48208a38884d6cc4fd1da6521676e63876", "raw_response_path": "data/llm_responses/LEX7512__per_file__government_skeptic__lex7512-schedule.pdf__20250621T224236.json", "output_tokens": 316, "prompt_tokens": 1280, "total_tokens": 2772, "summary_length": 1791}, "government_apologist": {"text": "This comprehensive release of documents robustly substantiates the Australian Government's unwavering commitment to exemplary governance and the diligent application of the Commonwealth Electoral Act. The extensive correspondence, including urgent communications and detailed replies concerning the 2025 Federal elections and Norfolk Island (Documents 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11), unequivocally demonstrates a proactive, responsive, and coordinated approach to ensuring consistent and lawful administration across all territories. The Australian Electoral Commission's dedicated engagement, as evidenced by its direct responses to community members like Cherri Buffet (Document 4.A) and the Norfolk Island Chamber of Commerce (Document 11.B), highlights its steadfast commitment to universal democratic participation and upholding electoral integrity through transparent, legally sound responses to public inquiries.\n\nFurthermore, the inclusion of historical and foundational documents such as the Preamble CEM (Documents 1A, 1C), the United Nations CEM (Document 1B), the Chamber submission to the Preamble NIGC (Document 1D), the QV Royal Warrant Dec1856 (Document 1E), and detailed submissions to the Governance Committee regarding the Preamble (Documents 1F, 1G, 1H), clearly demonstrates the government's profound dedication to preserving Norfolk Island's unique cultural heritage and integrating it thoughtfully within the broader administrative framework. The careful application of redactions (e.g., S 22, S 47F, S 42) across various documents, allowing for significant access in part, underscores responsible information management, balancing transparency with necessary privacy and legal protections, thereby reinforcing stability and public trust through adherence to established legal and administrative channels.

Far from offering transparency, this index of documents, rife with strategic redactions and outright refusals, functions as a chilling roadmap of obfuscation and authoritarian control.\n\nThe very first entry, **Document 1, \"2025 Australian Federal elections - for urgent attention - Reply Requested,\"** immediately signals distress from the Islanders, yet its \"Access in part\" status, riddled with **S 22 (general information) and S 47F (personal information) redactions**, sets the tone for systemic stonewalling. This document, marked \"urgent,\" becomes a symbol of the government's deliberate act of withholding critical details concerning the electoral framework, which the FOI overview condemns as \"deeply flawed\" and a tool for \"forced assimilation.\" The requested reply, now obscured, highlights a profound contempt for democratic accountability.\n\nThe subsequent attachments, **1A and 1B, concerning the \"Preamble\" (1A) and \"United Nations\" (1C)**, though ultimately \"Release in full,\" bear initial titles indicating **\"CEM_Redacted.\"** This reveals a prior, sinister intent to control and censor crucial historical and international context. The government's initial impulse to redact even the *mention* of the \"United Nations\" (1C) speaks volumes about its fear of international scrutiny and its ongoing violation of self-determination principles, directly feeding into the \"illegal occupation\" narrative. The multiple \"Preamble\" documents (**1A, 1B, 1D, 1G, 1H**) expose a relentless, internal government focus on dismantling the island's unique \"Pitcairn identity,\" framing the full release of these documents not as transparency, but as a grudging admission of their own destructive agenda against the historical preamble.\n\n**Document 1E, the \"QV Royal Warrant Dec1856,\"** released \"in full,\" is a forced concession to historical truth. Its inclusion in this set of FOI documents, likely compelled by islander challenges, underscores the government's desperation to manage a narrative that demonstrably *lacks a foundational legal instrument of land transfer*. The very presence of this document, which outlines a grant *to* the Pitcairners rather than a transfer *from* them, fatally undermines Australia's claim to sovereignty, exposing its administration as an act of \"illegal occupation\" that it can no longer entirely conceal, despite its attempts to misrepresent High Court rulings.\n\nThe repeated appearance of communications involving the **\"Chamber letter to Australian Electoral Commission\" (1F, 11A) and the \"AEC response\" (4A, 11B)**, consistently marred by **S 47F and S 22 redactions** and resulting in \"Access in part\" decisions, unmasks the Australian Electoral Commission as a willing, if not eager, instrument of governmental oppression. The AEC's inability or unwillingness to provide full, unredacted responses to legitimate concerns from the Norfolk Island Chamber of Commerce confirms its active participation in \"stonewalling legitimate constitutional challenges\" and its complicity in maintaining a \"deeply flawed electoral framework.\" The *second* Chamber letter (11A) highlights the islanders' persistent but unheeded pleas, demonstrating the AEC's pattern of dismissive engagement.\n\nPerhaps most damning is the overwhelming pattern of internal communications\u2014**Documents 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12**\u2014all designated \"Access in part\" and riddled with **S 22, S 47F, and most disturbingly, S 42 (deliberative processes) redactions**. This consistent concealment of internal discussions regarding the \"2025 Australian Federal elections\" for Norfolk Island reveals a deliberate strategy to shield the government's decision-making from public scrutiny. The pervasive use of S 42 indicates that the very rationale, legal advice, and strategic planning behind the \"authoritarian overreach\" and \"calculated campaign of historical revisionism\" are being systematically hidden. This is not about protecting personal privacy; it is about protecting culpable parties and suppressing any evidence of malfeasance or legal vulnerability.\n\nFinally, the ultimate act of legal obfuscation and contempt for the rule of law is epitomized by **Document 13, \"FW FOR INFORMATIONCOMMENT Update - Meeting with AGS regarding Bradlow and Bock joint candidates,\"** which is shockingly designated **\"Refuse in full.\"** This total blackout of communication involving the Australian Government Solicitor (AGS) concerning potential legal challenges (\"Bradlow and Bock joint candidates\") is the most egregious display of governmental deceit. It signifies a desperate attempt to hide the core of Australia's legal strategy against legitimate challenges to its perceived sovereignty. This outright refusal to release information related to legal advice and ongoing challenges utterly guts any pretense of transparency and confirms the government's \"relentless legal obfuscation\" and its determination to operate outside the fundamental principles of accountability, cementing its image as an illegal occupier prioritising administrative fiat over fundamental human rights and democratic principles.\n\nThis FOI document list, therefore, is not a record of transparency, but a catalog of calculated concealment, revealing a government actively suppressing truth, dismantling identity, and operating with profound contempt for the rights of the Norfolk Islanders and the rule of law.", "model": "gemini-2.5-flash", "generated_at": "2025-06-21T22:43:13.569327", "source_hash": "f556b9cc7810bc26a6d7107bf0a75c48208a38884d6cc4fd1da6521676e63876", "raw_response_path": "data/llm_responses/LEX7512__per_file__highly_critical__lex7512-schedule.pdf__20250621T224313.json", "output_tokens": 1155, "prompt_tokens": 1331, "total_tokens": 5194, "summary_length": 5672}}, "extracted_text": "\n\n--- Page 1 ---\n\nDocument No.  Document Title \n\nRedactions \n\nDecision  \n\nPage  \n\n1 \n\n2025 Australian Federal elections -

Their arguments, supported by extensive historical documents and legal interpretations within the attachments, assert:\n    *   Norfolk Island was established as a \"distinct and separate Settlement\" by Queen Victoria in 1856 for Pitcairn settlers, with its own self-governance.\n    *   The 1913 Norfolk Island Act, which purportedly \"accepted\" the island into the Commonwealth, is invalid as it did not follow the proper constitutional process (Section 122, requiring the Queen to \"place\" and the Commonwealth to \"accept\").\n    *   Historical Australian government documents and a 1999 Royal Australian Mint letter (cited in the email chain and attachments) acknowledge Norfolk Island was \"never\" under NSW government, not legally part of the Commonwealth, and \"never been ceded or annexed to Australia.\"\n    *   Justice Callinan's view in *Bennett v Commonwealth* (2007) is highlighted: \"Norfolk Island did not on its acceptance by Australia, nor has it since, become part of Australia, geographically or politically.\"\n    *   They accuse the AEC of acting \"illegally and unlawfully\" by including Norfolk Islanders in federal elections and refer to ongoing petitions to the United Nations for non-self-governing territory status.\n\n2.  **AEC's Position:** The AEC consistently maintains it operates under statutory obligations, specifically the *Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918*. It refers the requesters to other government departments (Infrastructure, Attorney-General's, Home Affairs) for constitutional matters. The AEC explicitly refuses to engage further on the constitutional issues, stating its actions are based on High Court rulings, namely *Berwick Ltd v Gray* (1976) and *Bennett v Commonwealth* (2007), which it interprets as establishing that Norfolk Island forms part of the Commonwealth and granting electoral rights is a valid exercise of parliamentary power.\n\n### Relevance to the FOI Request\n\nThis document is highly relevant to the FOI request as it:\n\n*   **Directly articulates the requesters' challenge:** It provides the detailed legal and historical arguments, including specific High Court interpretations and government reports, that the Norfolk Island Chamber of Commerce and Ms. Cherri Buffett use to contest the AEC's legal and constitutional basis for electoral inclusion.\n*   **Shows the AEC's official response:** It demonstrates the AEC's refusal to engage on constitutional matters, its reliance on a particular interpretation of High Court rulings and statutory obligations, and its position that the issue is outside its purview.\n*   **Provides supporting evidence:** The numerous attachments (historical decrees, submissions on the Norfolk Island Act preamble, UN petition updates, and internal government documents) form the evidential basis for the requesters' claims, which are central to the FOI request's scope.\n*   **Illustrates the ongoing nature of the dispute:** The recent dates (Jan-April 2025 email chain, Sept 2024 submissions) confirm the active and persistent nature of the challenge to Norfolk Island's electoral status.", "model": "gemini-2.5-flash", "generated_at": "2025-06-21T22:26:01.311740", "source_hash": "f9a7537f92acf3e659ad2370ca061e3050bbad6420e82054c36d2f456be07731", "raw_response_path": "data/llm_responses/LEX7512__per_file__balanced__All Documents LEX7512.pdf__20250621T222601.json", "output_tokens": 756, "prompt_tokens": 48598, "total_tokens": 51317, "summary_length": 3722}, "left_leaning": {"text": "This document, an email from the Norfolk Island Chamber of Commerce (NICC) to the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) and various Commonwealth officials, critically exposes the Australian government's continued top-down imposition of authority and disregard for the self-determination of Norfolk Island's indigenous community.\n\nFrom a left-leaning perspective, the NICC's urgent communication highlights a profound challenge to democratic accountability and social equity. The Chamber vehemently asserts that indigenous Norfolk Islanders are *not* Australian citizens and that the Australian Commonwealth lacks legitimate authority or administration rights over Norfolk Island's land, air, and sea. This directly confronts the AEC's push for federal election inclusion, portraying it as an \"illegal and unlawful\" act that breaches both Australian constitutional law and international law.\n\nThe core of the NICC's argument hinges on historical claims of distinct colonial status, citing Queen Victoria's 1856 Order in Council which established Norfolk Island as a \"distinct and separate Settlement\" and an \"independent sovereign Nation\" for the Pitcairn Settlers. The document details extensive historical evidence, including Royal Warrants and original Orders in Council, to counter the Australian government's narrative of legitimate transfer or annexation. The NICC explicitly references a High Court of Australia judgment (Bennett v Commonwealth, 2007), noting Justice Callinan's observation that Norfolk Island \"did not on its acceptance by Australia, nor has it since, become part of Australia, geographically or politically,\" and that Australian citizenship was never a defining factor for the island's community. This powerful legal context underscores the profound historical injustice perpetuated by the Commonwealth.\n\nFurthermore, the document critiques the Australian government's 2015 repeal of the preamble to the Norfolk Island Act 1979, which had recognized the unique heritage of the Pitcairn descendants. The NICC frames this as a deliberate act of cultural erasure, rather than \"cultural inclusion,\" and a significant disrespect to the memory of Queen Victoria, the Monarchy, and the Pitcairn Settlers' descendants. This directly aligns with the FOI overview's emphasis on cultural erasure and the disregard for unique indigenous heritage.\n\nThe correspondence also reveals the Australian government's lack of transparency and refusal to engage on sovereignty issues. The NICC explicitly requests confirmation of historical facts, stating that governmental opacity suggests \"hiding something \u2013 perhaps the truth.\" The AEC's subsequent response (later in the email chain) to \"not intend to engage further on the constitutional issues\" perfectly encapsulates this pattern of avoidance, demonstrating a concerning lack of democratic accountability to the community it purports to govern.\n\nFinally, the document refers to ongoing efforts by Norfolk Islanders to seek international recognition through petitions to the UN, including a request for inscription on the list of non-self-governing territories and a human rights complaint. These actions underscore the community's desperate pursuit of social justice and self-determination in the face of what they perceive as an illegitimate and culturally destructive imposition of Australian authority. This entire exchange exemplifies the Commonwealth's deviation from progressive values, neglecting historical claims, and undermining local calls for autonomy, which inherently threatens the unique indigenous culture and its intertwined environmental stewardship.", "model": "gemini-2.5-flash", "generated_at": "2025-06-21T22:26:27.819106", "source_hash": "f9a7537f92acf3e659ad2370ca061e3050bbad6420e82054c36d2f456be07731", "raw_response_path": "data/llm_responses/LEX7512__per_file__left_leaning__All Documents LEX7512.pdf__20250621T222627.json", "output_tokens": 651, "prompt_tokens": 48533, "total_tokens": 50460, "summary_length": 3627}, "right_leaning": {"text": "This document, an email from the Norfolk Island Chamber of Commerce (NICC) to the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC), vehemently disputes the Commonwealth's authority to include Norfolk Islanders in federal elections, highlighting profound concerns over governmental overreach and the erosion of local autonomy. The NICC asserts that the Australian Commonwealth lacks legal and constitutional basis for its control over Norfolk Island, citing historical documents and a 1913 'Acceptance Act' that they contend is invalid. Crucially, the document reveals an FOI response from the Governor-General's office admitting inability to provide documentation for the transfer or control of Norfolk Island lands, directly undermining the Commonwealth's claim of legitimate ownership and governance.\n\nFrom a right-leaning perspective, this exchange exposes a chilling example of centralized power disregarding established historical and legal frameworks, thereby undermining local autonomy critical for economic self-determination. The NICC, as a voice for local enterprise, highlights past confidential government reports and even a Royal Australian Mint statement that Norfolk Island was 'not legally part of the Commonwealth' and 'never been ceded or annexed to Australia.' The AEC's dismissive response\u2014refusing to 'engage further on the constitutional issues'\u2014further underscores a federal bureaucracy unwilling to justify its expansive reach, which imposes a potentially unconstitutional burden on local residents and businesses. This ongoing dispute represents a significant fiscal drain on taxpayers for an administration with an ambiguous legal foundation, directly challenging principles of limited government, fiscal prudence, and the right to self-determination, while also potentially compromising national interest through unclear sovereign responsibility.", "model": "gemini-2.5-flash", "generated_at": "2025-06-21T22:26:56.763027", "source_hash": "f9a7537f92acf3e659ad2370ca061e3050bbad6420e82054c36d2f456be07731", "raw_response_path": "data/llm_responses/LEX7512__per_file__right_leaning__All Documents LEX7512.pdf__20250621T222656.json", "output_tokens": 314, "prompt_tokens": 48547, "total_tokens": 50691, "summary_length": 1862}, "government_skeptic": {"text": "From a government skeptic's viewpoint, this document within the FOI request showcases a clear pattern of bureaucratic deflection, a striking lack of accountability, and a hidden agenda to consolidate control over Norfolk Island at the expense of its people's unique identity and self-determination.\n\n**Evidence of Bureaucracy and Lack of Accountability:**\n\n*   **Refusal to Engage on Constitutional Challenges:** The Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) explicitly states, \"We do not intend to engage further on the constitutional issues you have raised.\" This is a quintessential example of stonewalling, where a government body, when faced with fundamental challenges to its authority, simply refuses to address them, effectively shutting down avenues for dispute resolution and accountability. Instead, the AEC attempts to deflect responsibility by referring the Norfolk Island Chamber of Commerce to other departments (Infrastructure, Attorney-General's, Home Affairs), creating a bureaucratic maze where no single entity takes responsibility for the overarching constitutional questions.\n*   **Dismissal of Legal Arguments and Appeals to UN:** The Australian government dismisses the Norfolk Islanders' petition to the UN for non-self-governing territory status based solely on its own Attorney-General's Department's advice, stating the island \"does not meet the UN\u2019s criteria.\" This unilateral dismissal, without open dialogue or external arbitration, demonstrates a lack of willingness to be held accountable to international standards or the islanders' grievances. Furthermore, the government's attempts to delegitimize the Norfolk Island People for Democracy (NIPD) by questioning their support or fundraising methods, and framing legitimate protests as \"risk to heritage values,\" are tactics to undermine opposition rather than address its substance.\n*   **Selective Legal Interpretation:** The AEC relies on High Court cases like *Berwick Ltd v Gray* and *Bennett v Commonwealth* to assert its authority. However, the Norfolk Island Chamber of Commerce directly refutes this, citing Justice Callinan's dissenting opinion in *Bennett v Commonwealth*, which stated that \"Norfolk Island did not on its acceptance by Australia, nor has it since, become part of Australia, geographically or politically. Statements to the contrary in Berwick Ltd v Gray [198] are wrong.\" This reveals the government's continued reliance on a legal interpretation that has been directly contradicted by a High Court judge, strongly suggesting a selective, self-serving application of law to maintain control rather than a commitment to accurate legal understanding.\n\n**Evidence of Hidden Agendas and Opaqueness:**\n\n*   **Undermining Cultural Identity through \"Cultural Inclusion\":** The most glaring evidence of a hidden agenda lies in the Department of Infrastructure's brief regarding the preamble to the Norfolk Island Act 1979. It openly admits the original preamble, which \"included a statement about the special relationship of Pitcairn Island descendants with Norfolk Island and their desire to preserve their traditions and culture,\" was *repealed in 2015* as \"a necessary step for cultural inclusion, and disengagement of the Pitcairn stronghold and cultural exclusion that had previously occurred.\" From a skeptic's viewpoint, this is a thinly veiled admission of a deliberate government strategy to dilute or erase the distinct Pitcairn cultural identity, framed hypocritically as \"inclusion.\" The push for a \"succinct, historically accurate, and inclusive\" *revised* preamble implies a rewriting of history to fit the government's preferred narrative, rather than genuinely reflecting the island's unique heritage.\n*   **Lack of Legitimate Authority:** The Norfolk Island Chamber of Commerce's submission, referencing FOI statements from the Governor-General\u2019s office, highlights a critical finding: the Governor-General's office was \"UNABLE TO IDENTIFY ANY DOCUMENTS\" proving an \"instrument of transfer\" of sovereign rights or land from the UK to the Commonwealth, or an \"original claim of right.\" This admission, which directly supports the overall FOI overview, is a profound indicator that the Australian government may lack legitimate, documented authority over Norfolk Island, operating on an assumed rather than legally transferred sovereignty.\n*   **Historical Revisionism and Concealment:** The Chamber's documentation includes damning quotes from historical Australian government sources (1906 NSW Governor, 1971 confidential report, 1999 Royal Australian Mint) stating that Norfolk Island was \"never\" under NSW government, was \"not legally part of the Commonwealth and hence is not part of 'Australia',\" and \"has never been ceded or annexed to Australia.\" These internal admissions, unearthed through FOI, starkly contradict the official public stance and current administration, exposing a long-standing pattern of concealing inconvenient truths to maintain perceived control. The revelation that the 1913 Norfolk Island Act was potentially invalid due to lack of Imperial legislation for Norfolk Island to be \"PLACED\" and then \"ACCEPTED\" by the Commonwealth further underscores this historical opaqueness and potential overreach.\n\nIn essence, this document package paints a picture of an Australian government systemically operating to maintain control over Norfolk Island through bureaucratic evasion, selective legal interpretations, and active suppression or revision of historical and cultural narratives, rather than engaging transparently and accountably with fundamental challenges to its authority.", "model": "gemini-2.5-flash", "generated_at": "2025-06-21T22:27:33.636641", "source_hash": "f9a7537f92acf3e659ad2370ca061e3050bbad6420e82054c36d2f456be07731", "raw_response_path": "data/llm_responses/LEX7512__per_file__government_skeptic__All Documents LEX7512.pdf__20250621T222733.json", "output_tokens": 1061, "prompt_tokens": 48513, "total_tokens": 52339, "summary_length": 5621}, "government_apologist": {"text": "The presented FOI documents, including correspondence and internal government briefs, unequivocally affirm the Australian Government's exemplary commitment to robust and effective governance. They showcase a proactive approach to ensuring consistent and lawful administration across all territories, including Norfolk Island.\n\nThe Australian Electoral Commission's (AEC) unwavering application of the Commonwealth Electoral Act is clearly demonstrated through its consistent and legally sound responses to inquiries, guaranteeing universal democratic participation and upholding the integrity of Australia's electoral system. These responses are firmly rooted in established High Court precedents, such as *Berwick Ltd v Gray* and *Bennett v Commonwealth*, which affirm Norfolk Island's place within the Commonwealth and validate parliamentary power to legislate for the territory. The AEC's clear guidance to direct constitutional inquiries to the Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development, Communications and the Arts and the Attorney-General\u2019s Department further exemplifies efficient inter-agency coordination and responsible information management.\n\nFurthermore, internal government discussions highlight a strong dedication to preserving Norfolk Island's unique cultural heritage. The deliberate repeal of the Norfolk Island Act's preamble in 2015 for \"cultural inclusion\" and \"disengagement of the Pitcairn stronghold,\" alongside ongoing efforts to develop a \"succinct, historically accurate, and inclusive\" new preamble through community consultation, demonstrates a forward-thinking and responsive policy framework. The continued support for Norf'k language education and the preservation of public holidays underscore the government's commitment to cultural identity amidst administrative integration.\n\nThe government's transparent engagement with community concerns is evident in its management of complex issues, such as petitions to the United Nations. Attorney-General's advice confirming that Norfolk Island does not meet the UN's criteria for non-self-governing territory status demonstrates a reliance on sound legal analysis and a commitment to stability. By effectively managing any challenges through established legal and administrative channels, the government reinforces public trust and its diligent efforts to serve the public good.", "model": "gemini-2.5-flash", "generated_at": "2025-06-21T22:28:00.979695", "source_hash": "f9a7537f92acf3e659ad2370ca061e3050bbad6420e82054c36d2f456be07731", "raw_response_path": "data/llm_responses/LEX7512__per_file__government_apologist__All Documents LEX7512.pdf__20250621T222800.json", "output_tokens": 393, "prompt_tokens": 48531, "total_tokens": 51237, "summary_length": 2377}, "highly_critical": {"text": "This document lays bare the Australian government's reprehensible campaign of cultural annihilation, legal obfuscation, and electoral coercion against Norfolk Island. It is a chilling testament to administrative fiat overriding fundamental rights and historical truth.\n\n**Every Flaw, Missed Opportunity, and Potential Harm:**\n\n1.  **Flagrant Disregard for Self-Determination and Identity (The Preamble Betrayal):**\n    *   The \"Key Issues Brief\" for the Preamble (Page 2) overtly admits the 2015 repeal of the original Norfolk Island Act 1979 preamble was a \"necessary step for cultural inclusion, and disengagement of the Pitcairn stronghold and cultural exclusion that had previously occurred.\" This is not a mistake, but a chilling, confessed act of **cultural annihilation**. It reveals a calculated strategy to dismantle the unique Pitcairn identity, deliberately erasing their \"special relationship\" and \"desire to preserve their traditions and culture\" as previously enshrined in the 1979 Act's own preamble (Page 4).\n    *   The proposed \"revised preamble\" (Page 2) is a cynical attempt to paper over this cultural vandalism. By stating it \"must be succinct, historically accurate, and inclusive to reflect the multicultural nature,\" it implicitly dismisses the *actual* historical Preamble and the Pitcairn heritage as somehow \"inaccurate\" or \"exclusive.\" This is a profound insult, dismissing the islanders' foundational identity under the guise of \"inclusion,\" a clear tactic of **historical revisionism** designed to further assimilate the population.\n    *   The government's claim of \"commitment to protecting Norfolk Island\u2019s culture and heritage\" through tokenistic gestures like Norf'k being an official language or maintaining public holidays (Page 2) is revealed as a hollow, disingenuous smokescreen. It offers crumbs while actively dismantling the core legal recognition of their identity.\n\n2.  **AEC as an Instrument of Authoritarian Overreach (The Electoral Farce):**\n    *   The Australian Electoral Commission (AEC), far from being an impartial body, is unmasked as a **willing instrument** in this strategy of forced assimilation. The Norfolk Island Chamber of Commerce (NICC) explicitly states that indigenous Norfolk Islanders are *not* Australian citizens and Australia has \"no authority, claim, or administration rights\" over the island (Page 26).\n    *   The AEC's repeated responses (March 26, 2024; Feb 3, 2025; April 17, 2025) demonstrate systematic **stonewalling and legal obfuscation**. Their refusal to \"engage further on the constitutional issues\" (Page 22) or simply stating the matter is for \"other departments\" (Page 23, 30) is a grotesque evasion of responsibility, demonstrating profound contempt for the legitimate constitutional challenges raised by the islanders.\n    *   The AEC's reliance on *Berwick Ltd v Gray* and *Bennett v Commonwealth* to justify including Norfolk Islanders in federal elections (Page 29) is a **deliberate misrepresentation of High Court rulings**. The NICC's powerful rebuttal (Page 29) cites Justice Callinan from *Bennett* directly: \"Norfolk Island did not on its acceptance by Australia, nor has it since, become part of Australia, geographically or politically. Statements to the contrary in Berwick Ltd v Gray [198] are wrong.\" This exposes the AEC's legal justification as based on a judicially refuted premise, rendering its actions an **illegal imposition** of electoral framework.\n\n3.  **No Foundational Legal Claim to Sovereignty (Illegal Occupation):**\n    *   This is the most damning revelation. The NICC, through Freedom of Information requests, has compelled the Governor-General's office to concede it is \"UNABLE TO IDENTIFY ANY DOCUMENTS WITHIN THE SCOPE OF YOUR REQUEST... THE DOCUMENT(S) SOUGHT CANNOT BE FOUND, DO NOT EXIST OR HAVE NOT BEEN RECEIVED\" (Page 24). The request was for the \"instrument of transfer from the United Kingdom, the Monarch or any entity to the Commonwealth of Australia providing a power of interest in lands situated on Norfolk Island.\" This shocking admission utterly guts Australia's claim to sovereignty and unequivocally proves its administration of Norfolk Island is an act of **illegal occupation**.\n    *   Further evidence of this illegitimacy is scattered throughout the document:\n        *   The NICC highlights that Imperial Legislation was *necessary* for annexation in 1913, asking \"Where is that British legislation?\" (Page 18) \u2013 a question the Australian government cannot answer because it does not exist.\n        *   The Hansard quote (Page 15) shows Australian MPs discussing Norfolk Island being \"under the Government of New South Wales\" and NSW \"acquiescing\" to transfer \u2013 a narrative the NICC vehemently debunks as \"Misinformation!\" stating Norfolk Island \"was 'never' under the Government of NSW!\" and that the 1913 Act's reliance on Section 122 of the Australian Constitution was flawed because the proper \"PLACED\" and \"ACCEPTED\" process \"never happened\" (Page 19). This reveals **systemic incompetence and historical deceit** at the highest levels of Australian governance.\n        *   Numerous \"Examples\" cited by the NICC (Page 24-25), drawn from Australian government documents, reinforce the island's non-Australian status: NSW Constitution Act 1902 boundaries do not include it, the NSW Local Government Act 1993 excludes it, a 1906 NSW Governor letter stated the island \"is not part of the Commonwealth,\" a 1971 confidential tax report stated \"The Island is not legally part of the Commonwealth and hence is not part of 'Australia',\" and even the Royal Australian Mint in 1999 stated Norfolk Island \"was not incorporated into the Commonwealth and has never been ceded or annexed to Australia.\" These are **incontrovertible internal admissions of an illegitimate claim**, yet the government continues its oppressive administration.\n\n4.  **Suppression of International Appeal (UN Petition Dismissal):**\n    *   The \"Petition to the United Nations (UN) Key Issues Brief\" (Page 6) details the Norfolk Island People for Democracy (NIPD) seeking inscription on the UN's non-self-governing territories list. The Australian government's dismissive response (\"UN has not scheduled time to consider the petition,\" \"Advice from the Attorney-General\u2019s Department is that Norfolk Island does not meet the UN\u2019s criteria\") (Page 6) frames this as an international failure on the islanders' part, rather than reflecting Australia's powerful lobbying and *de facto* suppression of their legitimate plea for decolonisation.\n    *   The brief's attempt to discredit NIPD by claiming support levels are \"difficult to gauge\" and raising \"concern and scrutiny\" over fundraising (Page 6) is a transparent tactic to undermine the credibility of a movement challenging Australia's illegal authority. The mention of a \"sit-in protest\" (Page 7) being a \"risk to the heritage values\" is a callous deflection from the profound human rights issues driving such acts of desperation. The \"alleged complaint\" to the UN Human Rights Committee about human rights breaches (Page 7) and Australia's subsequent denial of \"official notification\" and six-month response window, highlights a strategy of bureaucratic delay and evasion to avoid international scrutiny.\n\nIn sum, this document vividly illustrates a calculated and ongoing campaign of **governmental deceit and authoritarian overreach**. The Australian government's actions concerning Norfolk Island constitute nothing less than **illegal occupation**, supported by a deliberate campaign of **historical revisionism**, **cultural annihilation**, and **relentless legal obfuscation**, all while denying basic human rights and democratic principles to the indigenous people it unjustly controls.", "model": "gemini-2.5-flash", "generated_at": "2025-06-21T22:29:08.591002", "source_hash": "f9a7537f92acf3e659ad2370ca061e3050bbad6420e82054c36d2f456be07731", "raw_response_path": "data/llm_responses/LEX7512__per_file__highly_critical__All Documents LEX7512.pdf__20250621T222908.json", "output_tokens": 1666, "prompt_tokens": 48564, "total_tokens": 53900, "summary_length": 7764}}, "extracted_text": "\n\n--- Page 1 ---\n\nFrom:\nSent:\nTo:\nSubject:\nAttachments:\n\nNorfolk Island Chamber of Commerce, Inc. <norfolkisland.coc@gmail.com>\nWednesday, 15 January 2025 8:27 PM\nLegal Services Mailbox; Jeff Pope; \n2025 Australian Federal elections - for urgent attention - Reply Requested\nSubmission to Governance Committee re Preamble     16th September 2024.pdf; Submission to \nGovernance Committee re Preamble   ADDENDUM    16th September 2024.pdf; Attachment No. \n1  Preamble CEM_Redacted  Sussan Ley.pdf; Attachment No. 1A   2.03a Preamble Attachment Ae \nCEM.pdf; Attachment No. 1B   2.04 United Nations CEM_Redacted.pdf; Attachment No. 2  for \nChamber submission Preamble NIGC - Sept2024   FINAL.pdf; Attachment No. 3   QV Royal \nWarrant Dec1856.pdf; Chamber letter to Australian Electoral Commission  Jan2025 .pdf\n\nCAUTION: This email originated from outside of the Australian Federal Government.

He \nrequested that the Council of Elders support the Mayor in working with the Administrator \nto develop a proposed preamble for broad consultation.  The Administrator has advised \nthat the Mayor has held discussions with the Council of Elders.   \n\n\uf0b7 \n\nYou may wish to:  \n\no \n\no \n\nseek an update on the Mayor\u2019s meeting with the Council of Elders; and \n\nadvise that the Australian Government is committed to protecting Norfolk Island\u2019s \nculture and heritage, for example: \n\n\uf0a7 \n\n\uf0a7 \n\nBackground \n\nNorf\u2019k is an official language of Norfolk Island and the curriculum at Norfolk \nIsland Central School includes classes in the Norf\u2019k language and culture; and \n\nNorfolk Island\u2019s public holidays have been maintained. \n\n\uf0b7 \n\n\uf0b7 \n\n\uf0b7 \n\nThe NI Act previously contained a preamble that included a statement about the special \nrelationship of Pitcairn Island descendants with Norfolk Island and their desire to preserve \ntheir traditions and culture. \n\nThe Advisory Council established to represent the Norfolk Island community before the \ncommencement of NIRC consulted the Norfolk Island community on a proposed new \npreamble. However, community feedback was divided. \n\nIn February 2016, the Advisory Council recommended to the Hon Paul Fletcher MP, the \nthen Minister for Territories, Local Government and Major Projects, that the matter of a \npreamble should be further considered by NIRC. \n\n2.03 Key Issues Brief \u2013 Preamble to the Norfolk Island Act 1979 \n\nPage 1 of 2\n\n\n--- Page 3 ---\n\nDEPARTMENT OF

itself.  While it may \ncontain a number of statements of fact or statements of intent (or of \u201cgood \nintentions\u201d), it is not binding in any legal sense.  It therefore could not affect the \nconstitutional relationship between the Commonwealth and a self-governing \nTerritory such as Norfolk Island.  \n\nNorfolk Island Act 1979                    5\n\n\n--- Page 10 ---\n\nDEPARTMENT OF INFRASTRUCTURE, REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT AND CITIES \n\nKey Issues Brief \n\n2.04 Petition to the United Nations (UN) \n\nKey Issues \n\n\uf0b7 \n\n\uf0b7 \n\n\uf0b7 \n\n\uf0b7 \n\n\uf0b7 \n\n\uf0b7 \n\nIn April 2016, Geoffrey Robertson QC, acting on behalf of the Norfolk Island People for \nDemocracy (NIPD), submitted a petition to the Chair of the UN General Assembly\u2019s \nFourth Committee (the Special Political and Decolonisation Committee) requesting \nNorfolk Island be inscribed on the UN\u2019s list of non-self-governing territories.  \n\nThe UN list of non-self-governing territories identifies territories that the UN General \nAssembly deems to be \"non-self-governing\" and subject to a decolonisation process.  \n\nThe UN has not scheduled time to consider the petition.  \n\nAdvice from the Attorney-General\u2019s Department is that Norfolk Island does not meet the \nUN\u2019s criteria for inscription as a non-self-governing territory.  \n\nPeople from Norfolk Island have previously petitioned the UN for recognition as a \nnon-self-governing territory (in 1977 and 1994) without success.  \n\nOn 8 June 2018, the Council of Elders announced in the Norfolk Islander newspaper that it \nhas contracted \u2018Expert Advisory Services\u2019 to carry out a Self-Governance Assessment of \nNorfolk Island and to draft a UN General Assembly resolution to expedite the review of \ntheir petition. This work was expected to be completed by the end of August 2018 but the \nDepartment has not had any information to indicate this has occurred.  \n\nBackground: \n\nNIPD \n\n\uf0b7 \n\n\uf0b7 \n\nNIPD was established in June 2015 with the aim of having Norfolk Island inscribed on the \nUN\u2019s list of non-self-governing territories.  \n\nIt is difficult to gauge the true level of support for NIPD on Norfolk Island. The group \nclaim to have over 1,000 supporters (likely to include visitors to the Island) and to be \nrepresenting the majority of views. NIPD\u2019s fundraising methods and affiliations, however, \nhave been the subject of some concern and scrutiny in public forums.  \n\nProcess for Inscription \n\n\uf0b7 \n\n\uf0b7 \n\nThe UN General Assembly must approve any addition of a territory to the list of non-self-\ngoverning territories. This can follow a recommendation made by the Special Committee \non Decolonisation (also known as the Committee of 24, or C24) which monitors and \nreviews the list of non-self-governing territories. \n\nAlternatively, a draft resolution may be proposed before the UN General Assembly by a \nMember State. NIPD would need to obtain the sponsorship of a Member State to the UN to \nput forward the draft resolution to the UN General Assembly plenary.  \n\n2.04 Petition to the United Nations (UN) \n\nPage 1 of 2\n\n\n--- Page 11 ---\n\nDEPARTMENT OF INFRASTRUCTURE, REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT AND CITIES \n\n\uf0b7 \n\nPassage of the resolution would rely on the support of a simple majority of UN Member \nStates present and voting. This would likely require extensive lobbying by NIPD and the \nsponsoring Member State. The Department of Infrastructure, Regional Development and \nCities (the Department) is aware of lobbying by NIPD in New Zealand and the UK. \n\nSensitivities: If none just note \u2018Nil\u2019 \n\n\uf0b7  Since June 2016, NIPD has been staging a sit-in protest at the Old Military Barracks. The \n\nprotest presents a risk to the heritage values of the site.  \n\n\uf0b7  The Department is also aware of an alleged complaint lodged by Mr Albert Buffett, President \n\nof the Council of Elders, to the UN\u2019s Human Rights Committee claiming the Australian \nGovernment has breached its international human rights obligations.  \n\n\uf0b7  The Australian Government has received no official notification about this complaint from the \nUN. If a complaint is made Australia will generally have six months, from notification, to \nrespond. \n\nAttachments: Nil \n\n2.04 Petition to the United Nations (UN) \n\nPage 2 of 2\n\n\n--- Page 12 ---\n\nLetter     \n\n19th May 1856.\n\n\n--- Page 13 ---\n\nLetter for Order to draft Instructions\n\n\n--- Page 14 ---\n\n24th June 1856   \n\n--- Letter,   Instructions  with Royal Seal top left\n\n\n--- Page 15 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 16 ---\n\nAugust 1856 \n\nTrade and Foreign Affairs \n\nSeal at attached top left corner\n\n\n--- Page 17 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 18 ---\n\na a te ae, ey wd fur Uf ae,\u201d or 9\n\u2014 \u2018 a\n\n-\n\n-\n\nke oe i NGF AEE PIO\n\n-\n-\n\neS eer\n\n0)\nSs? ed ee =\nso a\n\nee\n\u201c\u00a2 -\n\n\u2014 ower\n\na\neres\n\u2014_\n\nF = ie ee - ;\nMe ait = yr vem norsr @\n\n, ti ww\n: = Pat\n2\n\n(yo ee ae a eae\n\n,\n>> .

The Australian Government also has no \u201ccontrol\u201d \nover the indigenous Norfolk Islanders, especially those who are descendants of the \nPitcairn Settlers living on Norfolk Island. \n\nFor some evidence of what is stated above we refer you all to the attachments. \n\nThe Chamber Committee also recommends you read freedom of information \nstatements from the Governor-General\u2019s office, Attorney-General\u2019s office, Australia \nPost, Fair Works Commission and many from the Department of Infrastructure, \nTransport, Regional Development, Communication and the Arts as well as other \ndepartments of the Australian Government, where you will see that the \nCommonwealth of Australia has no authority, even in an administrative role over \nNorfolk Island and Norfolk Islanders since 1901. \n\nIf the Australian Government insists on including indigenous Norfolk Islanders (those \nliving on Norfolk Island) in the Australian Government elections, then the Australian \n\nNorfolk Island Chamber of Commerce,   Norfolk Island                     Email:   norfolkisland.coc@gmail.com\n\n\n--- Page 47 ---\n\nGovernment is in breach of its own Commonwealth of Australia Constitution and \nbreaking its own laws and acting unlawfully and illegally in international law. \n\nThe Chamber Committee brings to your attention the following which was placed in \npublic domain in December 2024. \n\nOpen letter to media editors \nAt Last: A brief explanation of the Truth - Norfolk Island \nJust on 3 years we commenced the journey with the aim of finding out the \ntruth of what Norfolk Island\u2019s true legal and lawful status is since our ancestors \narrived on Norfolk Island 8 June 1856. Along the way we have had some help \nfrom a few people, and we thank you all for that. We have ignored the \nnegative comments, the threats and pushed through to eventually put \ntogether what we have found - the TRUTH. \n\nHer Majesty Queen Victoria\u2019s Imperial Wastelands Act 1855 \n\n\u00b7 This Act was for the purpose of settling \u2018unsettled\u2019 Imperial Crown land \n\n\u00b7 It was under this Act that allowed Queen Victoria\u2019s Agreement through the \n1856 Order in Council to separate Norfolk Island into a distinct and separate \nColony within the British Empire for the Pitcairn Settlers and their \ndescendants. \n\nIn May 1856 Queen Victoria commenced arrangements for a Royal Seal and \nthe Order 24 June 1856, was also for \u201cTrade and Foreign Affairs\u201d to be \u201cmade \nuse of within the said Government\u201d. Then December 1856 the Royal Warrant \nwas signed by Queen Victoria. All those were used to \u2018settle\u2019 the Crown waste \nland of Norfolk Island in 1856. The Governor of New South Wales as Governor \nof Norfolk Island \u201cfor the time being\u201d disappears completely. \n\nThe relocation of the Pitcairn Islanders to Norfolk Island was a result of a direct \nAgreement between Queen Victoria and the people of Pitcairn\u2019s Island. This \nAgreement carried legal, lawful and moral significance, recognising the Pitcairn \nIslander\u2019s autonomy, rights and self-governance under the protection of the \nImperial Crown.\n\n\n--- Page 48 ---\n\nThere is so much more to this Truth and in the new year it will be explained \nand how it links in a positive way for the United Nations complaint and what \naction needs to commence immediately. \u00b7 \n\nAlbert always used to say \u201cstart from 1855\u201d -- thanks Al. \n\nNo-one can change the Truth - and that Truth now must be adhered to for the \nmemory of our ancestors, for the sake of the descendants of the Pitcairn \nSettlers and the future generation and Norfolk Islanders. \n\nThere is more on this to come in 2025. \n\nIn the meantime, we are more than happy to talk to anyone who is willing to \nlisten and understand and accept the Truth. \n\nNorfolk Island\u2019s legal status must be reviewed and restored to reflect the \nprotections established under the Imperial 1855 Act. The breaches committed \n- both legal and moral- demand accountability and reaffirmation of the Norfolk \nIslanders rights. \n\nThe people of Norfolk Island (Pitcairn Settlers) were promised self-governance \nand autonomy under the Imperial Crown\u2019s protection. It is time for that \npromise to be honoured. \n\nMay 2025 be the year of lawful restoration - and may God be with all Ucklun. \nCatherine McCoy and Cherri Buffett, \nDescendants of the Pitcairn Settlers. \u00b7 28th December 2024 \n\nThe Chamber Committee awaits a reply from the Australian Electoral Commission \nbefore 31st January 2025. \n\nSincerely, \nNorfolk Island Chamber of Commerce Committee \nNorfolk Island Chamber of Commerce \n_Disclaimer_ \nThis message and the information therein is for the recipient only and may contain confidential and/or legally privileged \nmaterial.

That is unacceptable and leads to Norfolk Islanders and other \n\npeople believing that the Australian Government is possibly hiding something \u2013 perhaps the \n\ntruth.    \n\nIt is also a person\u2019s human rights to have and live by and with the truth: \n\nThe United Nations states: \n\nHuman rights are rights inherent to all human beings, regardless of race, sex, nationality, \n\nethnicity, language, religion, or any other status. Human rights include the right to life and \n\nliberty, freedom from slavery and torture, freedom of opinion and expression, the right to \n\nwork and education, and many more.  Everyone is entitled to these rights, without \n\ndiscrimination. \n\nhttps://www.un.org/en/global-issues/human-\n\nrights#:~:text=Human%20rights%20are%20rights%20inherent,and%20education%2\n\nC%20and%20many%20more. \n\nApart from adhering to the Australian Constitution, it is the Australian Government\u2019s moral \n\nduty to provide the legitimacy of history, especially after what was stated in the \n\ndocumentations for the then Minister responsible for Norfolk Island, Senator Ley and in \n\nwhich her brief refers to the then Preamble and the history of the descendants of the \n\nPitcairn Settlers  \n\n(Refer:  attachments   No. 1, 1A, 1B). \n\nAustralia is a constitutional monarchy.   \n\nFor the Commonwealth of Australia (Australian Government) to ignore, and/or change the \n\nhistory of Norfolk Island is unlawful and just as important, it is disrespectful and an insult to \n\nthe memory of Her Majesty Queen Victoria, to the Monarchy itself, to the descendants of \n\nthe Pitcairn Settlers and to Norfolk Islanders.   \n\nThe following reference to evidence should also be included in this proposed preamble.   \n\n(Refer attachment No. 2).   \n\nPage 2 of 6\n\n\n--- Page 51 ---\n\nThese copied extracts are from public documents obtained through research. \n\ni. \n\n19th May 1856 - Establishment of the Norfolk Island Seal to be used by the Norfolk \n\nIsland Government.   \n\nii. \n\n8th June 1856 \u2013 the Pitcairn Settlers arrived and took possession (ownership) of \n\nNorfolk Island, and from that day governed themselves with their own Constitution, \n\nlaws and government. \n\niii. \n\n24th June 1856 \u2013 An order of Her Majesty Queen Victoria   (refer to typed copy \n\nattachment No. 2) \n\niv. \n\n24th June 1856 - Her Majesty Queen Victoria\u2019s Instructions.

What is \n\nit a Copy of? \n\n\u2022 Where is the handwritten document (as referred to here), and written \n\nlike the Instructions mentioned above (point  no. iv) of the Order in \n\nCouncil dated 24th June 1856 with Her Majesty Queen Victoria\u2019s \n\napproval and Royal Seal? \n\nb)  In printed papers \u201cFurther Papers, Removal of Inhabitants of Pitcairn\u2019s Island to \n\nNorfolk Island\u201d there is the same typed information as referred to in a) above.    \n\nc)  That document in b) above is linked to a despatch from Hon. H. Labouchere, MP \n\n(London) to Governor Sir W. Denison (NSW) dated 27th June 1856.  Also included in \n\nthat same despatch is the wording:-  \n\nPage 3 of 6\n\n\n--- Page 52 ---\n\n\u201ctransmit to you Her Majesty\u2019s Instructions, under the Royal Sign Manual \n\nand Signet, for the guidance of your conduct in administering the affairs of \n\nNorfolk Island\u201d.   \n\nThose \u2018Instructions\u2019 are not included in the printed copies mentioned \n\nin b) above.  Why not? \n\nThe Chamber states that until all the correct and truthful information regarding Her \n\nMajesty Queen Victoria\u2019s decisions and instructions are provided to the public (which \n\nincludes Chamber members) then no further action can be taken about a proposed \n\npreamble.   \n\nThe reasons are because the 24th June 1856 Order in Council is referred to in:- \n\n\u27a2  The Order in Council 15th January 1897 \n\n\u27a2  The Order in Council 30th March 1914 \n\n\u27a2  The Norfolk Island Act No. 15 of 1913 \u2013 Commonwealth of Australia, and therefore in \n\nall other acts following on from the 1913 Act.                            \n\n\u27a2  The Norfolk Island Act 1979  \n\nTurning now to the Commonwealth of Australia (Australian Government) Norfolk Island Act \n\nNo. 15 of 1913 which is mentioned in the proposed preamble, the Chamber makes the \n\nfollowing comments: \n\n\u25aa  Firstly, in letters dated 1913 from the British Government (Downing Street) to \n\nAustralian Government it states that Imperial Legislation is necessary  \u201cbefore \n\nthe island [Norfolk Island] can be annexed to the Commonwealth or the \n\nadministration can be vested in the Commonwealth Government\u201d. \n\n(Refer: copy of letters -  Attachment no. 2) \n\nWhere is that British legislation? \n\n\u25aa  Secondly, The Commonwealth Federal Parliament enacted the 16th statute  - Pacific \n\nIsland Labourers Act 1901.  Up until 1970s when the Australian Government ended \n\nthe \u2018White Australia Policy\u2019, indigenous Norfolk Islanders were not wanted in \n\nAustralia.   \n\nPage 4 of 6\n\n\n--- Page 53 ---\n\n\u25aa  The Commonwealth Parliament enacted the Norfolk Island Acceptance Act 1913 \n\n(Commonwealth of Australia) assented to by the then Governor General of Australia \n\non 19th December 1913 (Act No. 15 of 1913). \n\n\u25aa  For the enactment of that 1913 legislation the Commonwealth of Australia \n\n(Australian Government) relied upon section 122 of the Commonwealth of Australia \n\nConstitution. \n\n\u25aa  Section 3 of the 1913 acceptance legislation declares Norfolk Island to be accepted \n\nby the Commonwealth of Australia as a \u2018territory under the authority of the \n\nCommonwealth by the name of Norfolk Island\u2019.   \n\n\u25aa \n\nIt is important to note and accept that \u2018declaration\u2019 had no legal force in 1913. \n\n\u25aa  Section 122 Government of Territories of the Australian Constitution: \n\no  The Parliament may make laws for the government of any territory \n\nsurrendered by any State in and accepted by the Commonwealth, or of any \n\nterritory placed by the Queen under the authority of and accepted by the \n\nCommonwealth, or otherwise acquired by the Commonwealth, and may \n\nallow the representation of such territory in either House of the Parliament to \n\nthe extent and on the terms which it thinks fit.\u201d \n\no  The proper process for section 122 is that: \n\n\u25aa  Norfolk Island to be \u201cplaced\u201d offered \n\n\u25aa  The Commonwealth of Australia to have then \u201caccepted\u201d the offer. \n\n\u25aa  This is not the process the Commonwealth of Australia did. \n\n\u25aa  Therefore, the Commonwealth of Australia has overstepped its \n\nauthority in terms of its possession by any constitutional power of \n\nNorfolk Island through making an acceptance law based on section \n\n122 of the Australian Federal Constitution. \n\n\u25aa  That 1913 legislation is invalid in law. \n\n\u25aa \n\nIt is also important to accept that the Australian Government 1913 legislation (as \n\nreferred to herein) does not mention any other Australian Government Constitutional \n\nbasis upon which Australia may have relied upon to enact the 1913 legislation.  For \n\nexample:  telecommunications, postal (section 51(v), defence (section 51(vi),  \n\n\u25aa \n\n In fact, section 51 of the Australian Constitution has no mention whatsoever in the \n\n1913 legislation for Norfolk Island and was not relied upon by the Australian \n\nGovernment in 1913 for the purported Australian enactment for Norfolk Island.  \n\nPage 5 of 6\n\n\n--- Page 54 ---\n\n\u25aa  The Fugitive Offenders Act 1881 - Imperial Order in Council No. 1031 of 1925 \n\nidentifies Papua and Norfolk Island still being a British Crown possession. \n\n\u25aa  The Chamber is certain  His Majesty the King as well as the Imperial Privy Council \n\nwould not have made such a major legal blunder to refer to Norfolk Island as a \n\nBritish Possession, (as mentioned above) and also it to be  placed under the \n\nauthority of the Commonwealth of Australia as the Australian government now \n\ncontends ownership, control of Norfolk Island as transferred in 1914. \n\n\u25aa  The Norfolk Island Act 1979 preamble has the supposedly legal history of Norfolk \n\nIsland, governing under the authority of the Commonwealth of Australia, and noting \n\nthe role of the Pitcairn Settlers for the settlement of Norfolk Island on 8 June 1856.  \n\n\u25aa  But from 2015 to the present day, it is obvious the Commonwealth of Australia has \n\nbecome determined to remove from Norfolk Island\u2019s history and also legislative \n\nrecords the history of the Pitcairn Settlers / Norfolk Islanders as well as the legal and \n\nlawful truth that: \n\nNorfolk Island is a distinct and separate Colony \n\nas by acts of the British Parliament. \n\n\u201cAn Act to amend so much of an Act of the last Session for the Government of \n\nNew South Wales and Van Diemen\u2019s Land as relates to Norfolk Island\u201d \n\n\u201cAn Act to repeal the Acts of Parliament now in force respecting the disposal \n\nof Waste Lands of the Crown in Her Majesty\u2019s Australian Colonies and to \n\nmake other provisions in lieu thereof\u201d \n\nIt is obvious today, as it was in 1920s when discussions were held between British \n\nGovernment officials with the then Prime Minister of Australia that the Commonwealth of \n\nAustralia (Australian Government) did NOT receive any ownership or legal title to Norfolk \n\nIsland at any time from 1914 onwards and the position and policy is that Norfolk Island \n\nremains a distinct and separate colony as given by Her Majesty Queen Victoria in 1856. \n\nNorfolk Island Chamber of Commerce Committee \n\nEmail:  \n\n17th September 2024 \n\nPage 6 of 6 \n\ns 47F\n\n\n--- Page 55 ---\n\nNorfolk Island Chamber of Commerce  \n\nOpen Submmission: \n\nADDENDUM to  \n\nSubmission to the  \n\nNorfolk Island Governance Committee \n\n\u201cProposed Preamble\u201d \n\nIn 1914 for the first time in the Commonwealth of Australia Federal Parliament there was a \n\nDouble Dissolution. \n\n1914\u2014the deadlock was broken by the Government losing its majority in the House as a \n\nresult of the double dissolution election.

Do not click links or open attachments unless you recognise the sender and\nknow the content is safe.\n\nGood morning Andrew\n\nReference your email and attached document.  I provide you with just a snippet of evidence that Norf'k Ailen (also known as Norfolk Island) is\nnot part of the Commonwealth of Australia and the Australian Government has no authority to administer or have control of the aliens land, sea\nand air, including the EEZ\n\nThese quotes below are from Australian Government documents.\n\nSo I would suggest the Australian Electoral Commission take a serious look at the illegal and unlawful actions they are doing in relation to Norf'k\nAilen.\n\nExample No. 1    Australian Hansard 1901   New South Wales Government \n\nExample No. 2\nCommonwealth of Australian Constitution Act   Section 122\n\nGovernment of territories.\n\nThe Parliament may make laws for the government of any territory surrendered by any State to and accepted by the\nCommonwealth, or of any territory placed by the Queen under the authority of and accepted by the Commonwealth, or\notherwise acquired by the Commonwealth, and may allow the representation of such territory in either House of the\nParliament to the extent and on the terms which it thinks fit.\n\nExample No. 3 \n\nExample No. 4\n\nThe lawful exercise of Section 122 of the Australian Constitutional law making power for territories by the\nAustralian federal parliament required the following essential elements:\n\ns 42s 42s 47FSection 22Section 22Section 22\n\n\n--- Page 65 ---\n\n(a) That Norfolk Island had already been \"PLACED\" under the authority of the Commonwealth by the\nSovereign\n\n(b) Then the Commonwealth of Australia (prior to the making of any territories law for Norfolk\nIsland) \"ACCEPTED\" the placement of Norfolk Island by the Crown\n\n(c)  That the law being made be for the peace order and good government of a territory seems to be\nleft unstated by the Constitution and seems largely over the years to have been left in the hands of\nthe lawmakers and bureaucracy unless challenged in the courts by a person or persons with proper\nlegal standing to bring such a challenge.\n\nThis never happened.\n\nExample No. 5\n\nThe Australia Act 1986 (Commonwealth) was enacted into law and signed by Her Majesty 1988.\n\nhttps://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/C2004A03181\n\nThat Australia Act 1986 (Commonwealth) now prevents His Majesty the King from making any new Order\nin Council or seeking the making by the British Imperial Parliament of any new Imperial law formally\ntransferring outright ownership of Norfolk Island to the Commonwealth of Australia.\n\nExample No. 6\n\nNorf'k Ailen is

With all due respect to Mr. Johnson the \nAustralian Electoral Commission is acting illegally and unlawfully in relation to \nincluding indigenous Norfolk Islanders who live on Norfolk Island in the Australian \nElectoral role. \n\nIn reference to your paragraph -    \u201cAs the AEC has previously advised the Norfolk \nIsland Chamber of Commerce, the matters you raise are matters for the \nCommonwealth Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development, \nCommunications and the Arts (responsible for territories and Norfolk Island), the \nAttorney-General\u2019s Department (responsible for Constitutional matters) and the \nDepartment of Home Affairs (responsible for citizenship).\u201d This is incorrect, it is a \nmatter for all departments, agents of the Australian Government, and  including all \npoliticians of the Australian Parliament. \n\nYour letter states:  \u201cThe High Court held in Berwick Ltd v Gray [1976] HCA 12 that \nNorfolk Island forms part of the Commonwealth. In 2007, the High Court further \ndismissed a challenge by Norfolk Islanders in Bennett v Commonwealth [2007] HCA 18 \nregarding the validity of Commonwealth legislation requiring persons to vote in \nNorfolk Island elections.

That is misinformation. \nBerwick has since been declared limited to the question of whether \u2013 Norfolk \nIsland can be subject to Australian taxation laws and no more. \nIndeed, in part of paragraph [177] of the High Court of Australia judgement \nBennett v the Commonwealth case, Justice Callinan (as His Honour then was) \nand which does not seem to have been disagreed with by other High Court \njudges in the Bennett v The Commonwealth case: -  \n\n\u201cOn acceptance by Australia, Norfolk Island was a Crown possession or \ndependency which had been established as a distinct and separate \nsettlement for occupation by Pitcairners and their descendants, and others \nadmitted to their community.  Norfolk Island did not on its acceptance by \nAustralia, nor has it since, become part of Australia, geographically or \npolitically.  Statements to the contrary in Berwick Ltd v Gray [198] are \nwrong.  Its community is not and has never been part of the Australian \ncommunity.  Australian citizenship has never been a determining factor in \nidentifying the community of the island.\u201d \nIn the Bennett case High Court Australian Justices had reservations about \nany attempt by the Commonwealth of Australia and others to rely on \nBerwick Ltd v Gray as the main reason for any claim by the Commonwealth \nof Australia that Norfolk Island was a part of that country for all reasons \nrather than just for Australian Government taxation. \n\nNorfolk Island Chamber of Commerce,   Norfolk Island                     Email:   norfolkisland.coc@gmail.com\n\n\n--- Page 113 ---\n\nReference Commonwealth of Australia Constitution and Section 122.  This is \ncompletely irrelevant in relation to Norfolk Island.  There was no Imperial legislation \n(as evidence shows In British documents) in 1913 to allow for Norfolk Island to be \n\u201cPLACED\u201d for then the Commonwealth Government to \u201cACCEPTED\u201d.  Separate to that \nthere are also other legal and lawful reasons why Norfolk Island is not part of and \ncannot be administered by the Commonwealth of Australia. \n\nThe Norfolk Island Chamber of Commerce now requests the Australian Electoral \nCommission to rectify this unlawful and illegal matter forthwith. \n\nSincerely, \n\nCherri Buffett \nPresident  \nfor \nNNorfolk Island Chamber of Commerce Committee \nNorfolk Island Chamber of Commerce \n\n_Disclaimer_ \nThis message and the information therein is for the recipient only and may contain confidential and/or legally privileged \nmaterial.

This Act requires Australian citizens residing in Norfolk Island who are over the age of 18 to be\nenrolled and vote in federal elections. Failure to enrol or vote may lead to an administrative penalty or\nprosecution in court.\n\nYour correspondence raised concerns regarding the High Court decisions Berwick Lid v Gray [1976]\nHCA 12 and Bennett v Commonwealth [2007] HCA 18 (\u2018Bennett\u2019), by referring to a paragraph of\nJustice Callinan\u2019s judgment in Bennett set out the plaintiffs submissions in that case. If you read that\ndecision, you will see that Justice Callinan rejected the plaintiffs submissions (see paragraph 178 of\nBennett) and agreed with the other members of the High Court that Commonwealth laws can apply to\nNorfolk Island.\n\nThe Australian Electoral Commission does not intend to engage in any further correspondence on\nthis matter with the Norfolk Island Chamber of Commerce. Should you wish to pursue any other\nconcerns on the administration of Norfolk Island, | encourage you to direct these matters to the\nresponsible Commonwealth department as outlined in the Administrative Arrangements Order.\n\n| look forward to the full participation of all eligible citizens residing on Norfolk Island in the 2025\nfederal election.\n\nSection 47F\n\n   \n\nJeff Pope\nActing Electoral Commissioner\n3 February 2025\n\n10-12 Mort Street, Canberra ACT 2600 P02 6271 4411 WWW.aeC.govV.au\n\n\n--- Page 115 ---\n\nFrom:\nTo:\nBcc:\nSubject:\nDate:\n\nLegal Services Mailbox\nnorfolkisland.coc@gmail.com\n; \n\n; Andrew Johnson\n\nRE: Australian Government Federal elections - reply requested (LEX7954) [SEC=OFFICIAL]\nThursday, 17 April 2025 4:41:23 PM\n\nDear Chamber Committee\n\nThe Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) is a statutory authority that is required to administer\nfederal election events in accordance with the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918.

The NICC asserts that Norfolk Island is not legally part of the Commonwealth of Australia, that indigenous Norfolk Islanders are not Australian citizens, and therefore, the Australian Government has no authority or administration rights over the island or its people. The request seeks specific legal and lawful documentation to substantiate Australia's claim over Norfolk Island.\n\n### Documents from the FOI Request\n\nThe documents released and referenced in this FOI request package include:\n*   **Initial Correspondence:** Emails from the Norfolk Island Chamber of Commerce (Doc 1, 1G, 1H, 11, 11A) and Cherri Buffett (Doc 2, 3, 4) to the AEC, copying various Australian government officials and parliamentarians.\n*   **AEC Responses:** Emails from the AEC's Chief Legal Officer, Andrew Johnson, and Acting Electoral Commissioner, Jeff Pope (Doc 2, 4A, 6, 7, 11, 11B, 12).\n*   **Internal Government Briefs:** Attachments from the Department of Infrastructure, Regional Development and Cities concerning the \"Preamble to the Norfolk Island Act 1979\" (Doc 1A) and a \"Petition to the United Nations (UN)\" (Doc 1B).\n*   **Historical Documents:** Copies of a Queen Victoria Royal Warrant (Dec 1856) (Doc 1F) and various historical Orders in Council, letters, and Hansard extracts (Doc 1D, 1E, 1G, 1H) provided by the Chamber to support their claims.\n*   **Refused Document:** One document (Doc 13) related to a meeting with the Australian Government Solicitor regarding joint candidates was refused in full.\n\n### Main Content from the FOI Request Documents\n\n**Arguments presented by the Norfolk Island Chamber of Commerce (NICC) and Cherri Buffett:**\n*   **Norfolk Island's Legal Status:** The Chamber maintains that Norfolk Island is a \"distinct and separate Colony,\" established for the Pitcairn Settlers and their descendants by Queen Victoria's 1856 Order in Council and Royal Warrant, and has never been legally annexed or transferred to Australia.\n*   **Citizenship and Electoral Rights:** They argue that indigenous Norfolk Islanders are not Australian citizens and, therefore, are not subject to Australian electoral laws.\n*   **Invalidity of Australian Legislation:**\n    *   The *Norfolk Island Act 1913* and subsequent Australian legislation are deemed invalid because necessary Imperial legislation for annexation or transfer from the United Kingdom is missing.\n    *   They assert that Section 122 of the Australian Constitution (\"Government of territories\") was not properly followed, as Norfolk Island was never \"placed\" under Commonwealth authority by the Sovereign before being \"accepted.\"\n    *   They highlight that Norfolk Island was never part of New South Wales, citing the *NSW Constitution Act 1902* boundaries.\n    *   They invoke the *Statute of Westminster Adoption Act 1942*, arguing its sections prevent the Commonwealth from legislating local government laws for Norfolk Island.\n*   **Supporting Evidence:**\n    *   Quotes from various Australian government documents (including Hansard 1901, a 1971 confidential report, and a 1999 Royal Australian Mint statement) are provided, allegedly stating that Norfolk Island is not legally part of the Commonwealth, has never been ceded or annexed, and that no land transfer instruments exist.\n    *   A previous FOI request to the Governor-General's office reportedly found no documents for the transfer of land interest or original claim of right over Norfolk Island.\n    *   They specifically cite Justice Callinan's comments in *Bennett v Commonwealth* (2007) that Norfolk Island \"did not on its acceptance by Australia, nor has it since, become part of Australia, geographically or politically,\" arguing this challenges the premise of Australia's control.\n*   **Requested Documents:** The Chamber explicitly requests certified copies of:\n    1.  Documents proving Norfolk Island was annexed to New South Wales.\n    2.  Results of a New South Wales referendum agreeing to this annexation.\n    3.

The AEC explicitly refutes the Chamber's interpretation of Justice Callinan's judgment in *Bennett*, stating he rejected the plaintiffs' submissions.\n*   **Jurisdiction:** The AEC declines to engage further on constitutional matters, advising the Chamber to direct these concerns to the Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development, Communications and the Arts (responsible for territories), the Attorney-General\u2019s Department (constitutional matters), or the Department of Home Affairs (citizenship).\n*   **Document Holding:** The AEC states it does not hold the specific historical documents requested by the Chamber regarding annexation or transfer of Norfolk Island's status.", "model": "gemini-2.5-flash", "generated_at": "2025-06-22T00:22:18.671015", "source_hash": "5e53fd988e1320b05613eed4b7103696e221176cc593350cd8433a0fcee001f0", "raw_response_path": "data/llm_responses/LEX7512__overall__balanced__20250622T002218.json", "output_tokens": 1351, "prompt_tokens": 56530, "total_tokens": 59686, "summary_length": 6318}, "short_index": {"text": "The Norfolk Island Chamber of Commerce (NICC) and Cherri Buffett initiated an FOI request to challenge the Australian Electoral Commission's (AEC) requirement for indigenous Norfolk Islanders to vote in Australian federal elections.

From a politically left-leaning perspective, these documents reveal significant deviations from progressive values, primarily in the areas of social justice and civil liberties, with implications for wealth distribution.\n\n**Social Justice:**\nThe documents show a clear struggle for self-determination and the recognition of the unique cultural and historical identity of Norfolk Islanders, specifically the Pitcairn descendants. The Australian Government's 2015 repeal of the preamble to the Norfolk Island Act 1979, which acknowledged the \"special relationship\" and desire to \"preserve their traditions and culture\" of the Pitcairn descendants, is described by government documents (2.03 Preamble Key Issues Brief) as a move towards \"cultural inclusion\" and away from a \"Pitcairn stronghold.\" This framing, and the act itself, can be viewed as an attempt to diminish or erase the distinct Indigenous heritage and historical claims of a unique cultural group, aligning with a assimilationist rather than a self-determinationist approach.\n\nThe Norfolk Island Chamber of Commerce (NICC) and advocates like Cherri Buffett consistently assert that Indigenous Norfolk Islanders are not Australian citizens and that the Australian Government lacks lawful authority over the island, its land, sea, and air. They highlight previous attempts to be inscribed on the UN's list of non-self-governing territories and an alleged human rights complaint, underscoring their belief that their right to self-governance is being violated. Furthermore, the NICC's reference to the historical \"White Australia Policy\" (Submission to Governance Committee re Preamble, p. 52) suggests a history of racial discrimination where Indigenous Norfolk Islanders were \"not wanted in Australia,\" adding a layer of historical injustice to their current claims of unlawful Australian control.\n\n**Civil Liberties:**\nThe documents reveal a direct challenge to the civil liberties of Norfolk Islanders through the imposition of compulsory Australian federal elections. The Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) consistently states its statutory obligation to enforce enrollment and voting, warning of \"administrative penalty or prosecution\" for non-compliance (Doc 4.A, 11.B). This top-down enforcement, in the face of persistent and detailed legal arguments from the NICC disputing Australian sovereignty and the validity of relevant acts (e.g., 1913 Norfolk Island Act, Section 122 of the Constitution, Statute of Westminster), represents a profound deviation from progressive values of consent of the governed, political freedom, and respect for legitimate dissent. The AEC's repeated refusal to \"engage further on the constitutional issues\" (Doc 2, 11.B) and directing inquiries to other departments (Doc 11.B, 12) demonstrates a bureaucratic unwillingness to address fundamental questions of jurisdiction and civil rights, effectively shutting down dialogue on a matter of core importance to the community.\n\n**Wealth Distribution:**\nWhile not explicitly detailed, the implications for wealth distribution are present. The *Berwick Ltd v Gray* High Court decision, which the AEC cites as affirming the applicability of Commonwealth laws, is clarified by the NICC (citing Justice Callinan in *Bennett v Commonwealth*) as being limited to \"Australian taxation laws\" (Doc 11.B). If Norfolk Island is indeed \"not legally part of the Commonwealth and hence is not part of 'Australia'\" as a 1971 confidential report is quoted as stating (Doc 2-10), then the imposition of Australian taxation without legitimate legal and consensual authority constitutes a form of wealth extraction from a community that disputes the basis of that extraction. Self-governance, a key progressive ideal, would typically imply local control over resources and economic policies, which is being denied here.\n\n**Corporate Influence & Environmental Impact:**\nThese documents do not contain significant information regarding corporate influence or direct environmental impact related to government actions. The original preamble's mention of environmental protection (Doc 1A) suggests that local environmental concerns are valued by the community, but there is no specific policy revealed that aligns or deviates from progressive environmental stewardship.\n\n**Overall Progressive Evaluation:**\nThe Australian Government's actions, as revealed in these documents, largely deviate from core progressive values. There is a clear pattern of **disregard for self-determination** and **cultural rights** of the Pitcairn descendants, evidenced by the historical preamble repeal and the imposition of electoral obligations despite strong arguments against Australian sovereignty. The government's approach appears to be a rigid, bureaucratic enforcement of perceived authority, marked by a **lack of transparency and accountability** regarding the fundamental legal basis for its claims over Norfolk Island (e.g., the Governor-General's FOI response inability to find land transfer documents). This stance, rather than fostering genuine \"cultural inclusion\" through mutual respect and negotiation, appears to continue a colonial legacy of control over a distinct community, fundamentally contradicting progressive principles of social justice and civil liberties.", "model": "gemini-2.5-flash", "generated_at": "2025-06-22T00:23:06.956142", "source_hash": "5e53fd988e1320b05613eed4b7103696e221176cc593350cd8433a0fcee001f0", "raw_response_path": "data/llm_responses/LEX7512__overall__left_leaning__20250622T002306.json", "output_tokens": 1041, "prompt_tokens": 56521, "total_tokens": 60218, "summary_length": 5538}, "short_index": {"text": "From a left-leaning perspective, the FOI documents expose the Australian Government's actions concerning Norfolk Island as a stark departure from core progressive values, particularly regarding self-determination, social justice, and civil liberties.

From a politically right-leaning perspective, these documents highlight several significant deviations from conservative principles of limited government, individual liberty, fiscal responsibility, and clearly defined national security.\n\n**Individual Liberty and Limited Government:** The core contention from the Norfolk Island Chamber of Commerce (NICC) and Ms. Cherri Buffett is that the Australian Commonwealth government is overstepping its legitimate bounds by imposing Australian laws, including mandatory electoral enrolment and voting, on Norfolk Island residents. They assert that indigenous Norfolk Islanders are not Australian citizens and that, based on historical British Imperial documents (such as Queen Victoria's 1856 Order in Council and Royal Warrants), Norfolk Island remains a \"distinct and separate Colony\" and was never lawfully annexed or ceded to Australia. This directly challenges the principle of individual liberty, as it suggests citizens are being compelled to participate in a system whose authority they dispute, and illustrates government acting beyond its demonstrably legal and historical limits.\n\nThe documents reveal claims that the Australian government's 1913 Norfolk Island Act is \"invalid in law\" because proper Imperial legislation for \"placement\" and subsequent \"acceptance\" under Section 122 of the Australian Constitution never occurred. The NICC further highlights a 1999 statement from the Royal Australian Mint (cited by Ms. Buffett) confirming Norfolk Island \"was not incorporated into the Commonwealth and has never been ceded or annexed to Australia.\" This pattern suggests an expansion of government power without clear constitutional or historical mandate, a classic concern for advocates of limited government.\n\nThe Australian Electoral Commission (AEC)'s response consistently dismisses these constitutional arguments, stating it is \"required to administer\" existing Commonwealth electoral laws and does \"not intend to engage further on the constitutional issues.\" This bureaucratic refusal to engage with fundamental questions about its own jurisdictional authority can be perceived as a dismissal of citizen concerns and an evasion of accountability, contrary to principles of transparent and responsive governance. The earlier repeal of the Preamble to the Norfolk Island Act 1979, which acknowledged the unique Pitcairn heritage, is also criticized by the NICC as a move to erase historical truth, further indicating government interference in cultural and local identity rather than fostering local self-determination.\n\n**Fiscal Responsibility:** While not extensively detailed, the underlying legal dispute has fiscal implications. If Norfolk Island is not legally part of the Commonwealth, Australian taxpayer funds spent on its administration, or taxes collected from its residents, could be seen as an illegitimate and potentially inefficient allocation of resources. The FOI response from the Governor-General's office stating an inability to identify documents for the transfer of land interest to the Commonwealth, coupled with a 1971 confidential report (cited by Ms. Buffett) noting that \"The Island is not legally part of the Commonwealth and hence is not part of 'Australia',\" raises serious questions about the fiscal legitimacy of taxation and expenditure on the island.\n\n**National Security:** A 1906 letter from the NSW Governor (cited by Ms. Buffett) stating, \"The Defence of this island is very important but as it is not part of the Commonwealth nothing can be done by the Commonwealth Defence Department unless the island is annexed,\" highlights a potential national security vulnerability. Ambiguity in sovereignty can lead to confusion regarding defense responsibilities and capabilities, which contradicts the conservative tenet of clear and strong national defense.\n\nIn summary, these FOI documents, particularly the correspondence from the Norfolk Island Chamber of Commerce and Ms. Cherri Buffett, present a narrative of governmental overreach. They depict the Australian Commonwealth as asserting authority without clear, demonstrable legal and historical foundations, encroaching on individual liberties, potentially misallocating fiscal resources, and creating ambiguities that could affect national security. The government's consistent refusal to engage on these foundational legal questions further exacerbates concerns about the principles of limited, accountable, and constitutionally constrained governance.", "model": "gemini-2.5-flash", "generated_at": "2025-06-22T00:23:42.127298", "source_hash": "5e53fd988e1320b05613eed4b7103696e221176cc593350cd8433a0fcee001f0", "raw_response_path": "data/llm_responses/LEX7512__overall__right_leaning__20250622T002342.json", "output_tokens": 822, "prompt_tokens": 56521, "total_tokens": 59327, "summary_length": 4743}, "short_index": {"text": "From a right-leaning perspective, these FOI documents reveal significant government overreach by the Australian Commonwealth on Norfolk Island, asserting authority without clear constitutional or historical mandate.

A critical analysis exposes potential government overreach, historical obfuscation, and a striking lack of transparency.\n\n**Key Findings and Skeptical Interpretation:**\n\n1.  **Contested Sovereignty and Citizenship:** The NICC vehemently asserts that Norfolk Island is a \"distinct and separate Colony\" and that its indigenous people are not Australian citizens. They provide extensive historical and legal arguments, citing Imperial Acts (e.g., Queen Victoria's 1856 Order in Council establishing Norfolk Island as a separate settlement for Pitcairn settlers), and pointing to a complete absence of valid annexation or transfer documents from the United Kingdom to Australia. This foundational challenge to Australian sovereignty is repeatedly dismissed by federal authorities.\n\n2.  **Missing Crucial Documents:** Most damningly, a previous FOI request to the Governor-General's office concerning documents of land transfer or power of interest in Norfolk Island from the UK to the Commonwealth yielded a response: \"THE OFFICE HAS BEEN UNABLE TO IDENTIFY ANY DOCUMENTS WITHIN THE SCOPE OF YOUR REQUEST... THAT THE DOCUMENT(S) SOUGHT CANNOT BE FOUND, DO NOT EXIST OR HAVE NOT BEEN RECEIVED.\" This admission suggests the Australian government lacks fundamental legal instruments to support its claim of outright ownership and administrative authority over Norfolk Island, raising serious questions about the legitimacy of its control.\n\n3.  **Historical Revisionism and Misinformation:**\n    *   The NICC highlights instances of \"misinformation,\" such as a 1913 Hansard statement implying New South Wales \"acquiesced\" to the Commonwealth taking over Norfolk Island, which the NICC explicitly refutes, stating Norfolk Island \"was 'never' under the Government of NSW!\"\n    *   The discussion around the \"Preamble to the Norfolk Island Act 1979\" (Document 1A) reveals a shifting narrative. Repealed in 2015 to disengage the \"Pitcairn stronghold\" and for \"cultural inclusion,\" the government then, in 2018, initiated discussions about reinstating a revised preamble. This suggests a willingness to manipulate historical representation to suit current administrative goals, rather than uphold an accurate record.\n    *   Confidential government reports from 1971 and statements from the Royal Australian Mint in 1999 (cited by NICC) explicitly stating \"The Island is not legally part of the Commonwealth and hence is not part of 'Australia'\" and \"Norfolk Island itself was not incorporated into the Commonwealth and has never been ceded or annexed to Australia\" directly contradict the current government position and imply a long history of concealed or ignored legal ambiguities.\n\n4.  **Bureaucratic Stonewalling and Dismissal of Legal Arguments:** The Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) repeatedly issues boilerplate responses, stating it is \"required to administer\" electoral acts extended to Norfolk Island and that it \"does not intend to engage further on the constitutional issues.\" While citing High Court cases (Berwick v Gray, Bennett v Commonwealth) as justification for its authority, the AEC notably dismisses the NICC's detailed legal counter-arguments, including a direct quote from Justice Callinan's judgment in *Bennett v Commonwealth* (2007) that states Norfolk Island \"did not on its acceptance by Australia, nor has it since, become part of Australia, geographically or politically.\" The AEC's curt dismissal of this nuanced judicial opinion as merely \"the plaintiffs submissions\" (Document 11B) demonstrates a selective interpretation of legal precedent to avoid genuine engagement with fundamental challenges to its authority.\n\n5.  **Arbitrary Imposition of Law:** Despite the unresolved and vigorously debated legal and historical status, the Australian government (through the AEC) continues to enforce compulsory enrolment and voting for Norfolk Islanders, threatening \"administrative penalty or prosecution in court\" for non-compliance. This imposition, in the face of compelling evidence of a contested legal foundation and a lack of clear transfer documents, suggests an assertion of power without fully transparent or undisputed legal backing.\n\nIn essence, these documents paint a picture of a central government maintaining control over a territory through administrative fiat and selective legal interpretation, while seemingly lacking foundational legal documents to support its claims of sovereignty.
