      <h3>Summary of FOI Request Documents</h3>
<p>This summary outlines the main purpose of FOI Request No. LEX3177, the documents released in response, and their key content relevant to the request.</p>
<h4>1. Main Purpose of the FOI Request</h4>
<p>The FOI request (LEX3177) sought "all supporting documents behind the commission's conclusion that 'the [AEC's membership testing] methodology was appropriate for membership testing, including because it was rational, fair and practical in all the circumstances'" as stated in a previous determination (LEX967). Specifically, it requested documents supporting the claims of rationality and fairness.</p>
<h4>2. Documents from the FOI Request</h4>
<p>The primary document released is the <strong>"Commission Paper – Review of the delegate’s decision to deregister the Senior United Party of Australia"</strong> dated 17 November 2021. This paper incorporates and references several attachments, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) Testing Methodology Tables (November 2016):</strong> These tables outline the statistical sampling framework for membership testing based on the number of members lodged and the maximum permissible denials. (Attachments L, ZW)</li>
<li><strong>Advice provided to the Commission in relation to Party registration (20 March 2017):</strong> This document confirms the Electoral Commission's re-endorsement of the ABS methodology. (Attachment B)</li>
<li><strong>Application for review and further submission by the party officer (21 &amp; 25 March 2021):</strong> These detail the Seniors United Party of Australia's (SUPA) reasons for challenging the deregistration decision. (Attachments N, P)</li>
<li><strong>Records of Membership Testing Outcomes (various dates):</strong><ul>
<li>October 2020 List testing outcomes (Attachment I)</li>
<li>February 2021 List testing outcomes (Attachment M)</li>
<li>September 2021 List testing outcomes, including identification of duplicates and cross-party members (Attachment ZV), contact records (Attachment ZX), and a breakdown of membership numbers (Attachment ZY).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>3. Main Content Related to the FOI Request</h4>
<p>The released documents directly address the "appropriateness, rationality, fairness, and practicality" of the AEC's membership testing methodology through the review of the Seniors United Party of Australia's (SUPA) deregistration.</p>
<p><strong>AEC's Methodology and its Application:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Foundation:</strong> The Commission Paper (Para 3.14) states that the AEC's membership testing methodology, for lists of 500 individuals, was developed by the <strong>Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS)</strong> in 2010 (with updates in 2011 and 2017) and re-endorsed by the Electoral Commission in 2017. This endorsement and the ABS origin are presented as foundational to its rationality and appropriateness.</li>
<li><strong>Testing Rounds:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>October 2020 List:</strong> An initial test of SUPA's list of 525 claimed members required a random sample of 37 individuals, allowing for a maximum of 3 denials. The test resulted in 8 denials, leading to a determination of insufficient members (Para 5.1-5.2).</li>
<li><strong>February 2021 List:</strong> A second test of SUPA's list of 539 claimed members (after initial deregistration notice) required a sample of 44 individuals, allowing for a maximum of 5 denials. This test resulted in 9 denials, reinforcing the deregistration decision (Para 6.2-6.3).</li>
<li><strong>September 2021 List (during review):</strong> During the internal review, a new list of 538 eligible members was tested. This required a sample of 44 individuals, with a maximum of 5 denials permitted. This test resulted in only <strong>1 denial</strong> (Para 8.18-8.19), which provided statistical confidence that the party had at least 500 members.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Addressing Claims of Unfairness/Impracticality:</strong></p>
<p>The SUPA party officer, in their application for review, raised concerns about the fairness and practicality of the methodology for an elderly demographic, citing:<br />
*   Higher death rates and health issues.<br />
*   Dementia/memory loss leading to negative responses.<br />
*   Fear of phone scammers causing refusal to answer or negative responses.<br />
*   Alleged AEC errors in identifying duplicates/deceased members.<br />
*   Lack of scrutineers during testing (unlike election polling).<br />
*   The party's unique demographic representation and financial disadvantages.</p>
<p>The Commission Paper responds to these points (Para 8.12-8.17):<br />
*   It states that the methodology requires formal acknowledgment of membership and does not consider individual motivations or reasons for denials.<br />
*   It clarifies that deceased and duplicate members are removed from the list <em>before</em> sampling, not counted as negative responses, which can be beneficial to parties by reducing the required sample size for eligible members. It confirms internal review found no errors in duplicate/deceased identification.<br />
*   It affirms that the Electoral Act does not provide for scrutineers in membership testing.<br />
*   It asserts that factors such as a party's policies, demographics, or financial situation are <em>not relevant</em> to the statutory 500-member requirement and that the AEC applies the same, consistent test across all parties to maintain political neutrality.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion of the Review:</strong></p>
<p>Despite the initial deregistration and the party officer's arguments, the successful outcome of the <strong>September 2021 membership test</strong> (1 denial out of 44 responses) demonstrated that SUPA <em>did</em> meet the 500-member threshold according to the established ABS methodology. This led the Electoral Commission to recommend setting aside the delegate's deregistration decision and substituting it with a decision to <strong>maintain the registration of the Seniors United Party of Australia</strong> (Para 8.20, 9.1). This final outcome suggests that the methodology, despite initial failures by the party, was ultimately capable of affirming membership when the threshold was met.</p>

    <div class="ai-summary-markdown-content">
      <p>The FOI documents detail the Australian Electoral Commission's (AEC) review of its decision to deregister the Seniors United Party of Australia (SUPA) due to insufficient membership. From a left-leaning perspective, these documents reveal several points concerning social justice, wealth distribution, corporate influence, and civil liberties, highlighting instances where government actions or policies either align with or deviate from progressive values.</p>
<p><strong>Social Justice and Representation:</strong><br />
The core of the issue revolves around SUPA, a party explicitly established to represent "mainly elderly members" and "pensioners or part-pensioners" (p. 2, 3 of applicant's submission). The applicant argued that the AEC’s standard membership testing methodology, while ostensibly neutral, disproportionately disadvantaged this demographic. Reasons cited include:<br />
*   <strong>Higher Attrition and Health Issues:</strong> An acknowledged higher death rate, terminal health issues, and a "much higher rate of dementia, or loss of memory," leading members to deny or be unable to confirm membership during AEC calls (p. 10). This highlights how standardized bureaucratic processes can fail to accommodate the realities and vulnerabilities of specific social groups.<br />
*   <strong>Trust and Safety Concerns:</strong> Elderly members' heightened concern about "phone scammers" meant they were "much more likely to respond with a 'No' to any question put to them over a phone" or avoid answering calls from unknown numbers (p. 10). This underscores a systemic barrier to participation for a vulnerable group, an issue not adequately addressed by the AEC's rigid adherence to its methodology.<br />
*   <strong>Procedural Fairness:</strong> The applicant claimed "procedural unfairness" because political parties are not allowed scrutineers during membership testing, unlike on polling day (p. 11). This lack of transparency or independent oversight in a critical process for a party's existence deviates from progressive values of open and accountable governance.<br />
The AEC's response dismissed these concerns as "not relevant to the issue of whether the Party has ceased to have 500 members" and asserted that it would "not be appropriate for the Electoral Commission... to apply different membership tests to different parties" (p. 12). While upholding formal equality, this position ignores the principle of substantive equality, where different circumstances may require different approaches to ensure equitable participation for all groups.</p>
<p><strong>Wealth Distribution and Corporate Influence:</strong><br />
The documents indirectly shed light on the significant financial disadvantages faced by smaller, niche parties, contrasting sharply with the influence of wealth in politics:<br />
*   <strong>Funding Disparity:</strong> SUPA's applicant stated that, as its members are predominantly pensioners, the party's "income from donations is sharply reduced" because members often have no income tax to claim deductions against (p. 3 of applicant's submission). This lack of tax-deductible donations, compared to major parties, results in "little to no funds for communicating by mail... let alone advertising" or employing staff. This vividly illustrates how existing wealth distribution patterns are embedded within political finance laws, favoring parties with wealthier donor bases and making it harder for parties representing lower-income demographics to compete on an equal footing.<br />
*   <strong>Lobbying Power:</strong> The applicant explicitly contrasted SUPA's financial struggles with the existence of "ten lobbyists for every parliamentarian in Federal parliament... paid huge amounts and which have huge amounts to advertise to influence public opinion" (p. 4 of applicant's submission). This highlights the pervasive corporate and wealthy influence in politics, dwarfing the capacity of citizen-led, grassroots movements or parties representing less financially powerful segments of society. This imbalance of power fundamentally undermines democratic ideals of equal political voice.</p>
<p><strong>Civil Liberties (Participation):</strong><br />
While not directly a civil liberties breach, the practical barriers faced by elderly members due to fears of "phone scammers" (p. 10) indirectly impacts their civil liberty to associate and participate in a political party without undue burden or fear. The government's process, in this context, inadvertently creates a hurdle for a specific demographic's political engagement.</p>
<p><strong>Government Actions and Policy Deviation:</strong><br />
*   <strong>Increased Membership Threshold:</strong> The documents mention that the <em>Electoral Legislation Amendment (Party Registration Integrity) Act 2021</em> increased the membership threshold for non-Parliamentary parties from 500 to 1,500 members, taking effect after the period under review (p. 3). From a progressive viewpoint, this increase significantly raises the barrier to entry for new and smaller parties, further entrenching the power of established political entities and potentially stifling political diversity and the representation of minority interests. This policy directly deviates from values promoting broad democratic participation and diverse political expression.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong><br />
Ultimately, the AEC recommended re-registering SUPA based on a <em>third</em> membership list that successfully passed the test (p. 12). While this outcome demonstrates some flexibility in allowing a party to present new evidence, the process itself, and the AEC's initial dismissal of the specific social justice arguments related to the elderly demographic, raise concerns. The documents reveal how ostensibly neutral bureaucratic processes and legislative changes (like increased membership thresholds) can create systemic disadvantages for parties representing vulnerable or less wealthy segments of society, reinforcing existing power imbalances and undermining progressive goals of equitable participation and diverse representation in democracy.</p>

      <p>The provided FOI documents detail the Australian Electoral Commission's (AEC) process for reviewing the Seniors United Party of Australia's (SUPA) registration, specifically its compliance with the statutory 500-member threshold. This review, driven by a Freedom of Information request seeking insights into the AEC's "rational, fair, and practical" methodology, offers a glimpse into government oversight of political entities.</p>
<p><strong>Economic Efficiency:</strong> The documents reveal a highly process-driven and resource-intensive approach to verifying party membership. The AEC utilized an Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) statistical sampling methodology, involving multiple rounds of membership list submissions (October 2020, February 2021, September 2021), automated and manual checks against the electoral roll, and direct phone contact with sampled individuals. While the use of statistical methods aims for a level of efficiency over auditing every member, the repeated testing, extensions granted due to COVID-19 lockdowns, and the extensive internal review process, including an appeal by the party officer, suggest a significant expenditure of public resources. This complex and protracted verification process raises questions about whether a more streamlined, less burdensome method could achieve similar electoral integrity goals with greater economic efficiency.</p>
<p><strong>Individual Liberty:</strong> The requirement for a political party to maintain a minimum number of members, subject to government verification through direct contact with individuals, presents a tension with individual liberty and freedom of association. While the intent is to ensure legitimate public support for registered parties and prevent fraudulent registrations, the state's granular oversight into a voluntary association's internal affairs (its membership list) and direct questioning of citizens about their affiliations can be seen as intrusive. The party officer's concerns about elderly members' reluctance to confirm membership due to privacy fears, memory issues, or distrust of phone scammers highlight how a standardized government methodology might inadvertently impinge on the exercise of individual political affiliation or privacy.</p>
<p><strong>National Security:</strong> These documents do not directly address issues related to national security. The AEC's role primarily pertains to the integrity and administration of electoral processes within Australia, rather than safeguarding against foreign threats or other national security concerns.</p>
<p><strong>Fiscal Responsibility:</strong> The detailed and iterative nature of the membership verification process, as outlined, demands considerable taxpayer resources. Each submission of a membership list triggers a complex sequence of data processing, manual checks, and a large volume of phone calls. The fact that the party was deregistered, appealed, and then had to submit a third list for re-testing, all while the AEC processed extensions and reviewed detailed arguments, indicates substantial administrative costs. A fiscally responsible government would continually scrutinize such processes to ensure they deliver essential public value commensurate with their expense, particularly for maintaining a basic numerical threshold for political parties.</p>
<p><strong>Limited Government:</strong> The documents illustrate the considerable power of a government agency (the AEC) to regulate and, if deemed non-compliant, deregister political parties. The setting of a membership threshold (which was subsequently increased from 500 to 1,500 members by legislation, although the 500-member rule applied here) and the unilateral application of a specific, non-negotiable testing methodology, reflect a significant degree of government control over the political landscape. The AEC's dismissal of the party's arguments regarding demographic challenges, lack of scrutineer rights during testing, and financial disadvantages underscores a rigid adherence to statutory requirements, rather than discretionary accommodation. While a limited government must ensure fair and orderly elections, the extent of bureaucratic oversight in determining the legitimacy of political associations can be perceived as an overreach, potentially hindering the emergence or sustainability of grassroots or niche political movements, and thus limiting the free association of citizens in the political sphere.</p>
<p>In summary, the documents reveal a rigorous, albeit resource-intensive, government process for ensuring electoral integrity. From a right-leaning perspective, while the principle of verifying party legitimacy aligns with fiscal responsibility (preventing misuse of public resources by non-existent entities) and ensuring a sound electoral framework, the extent of bureaucratic engagement, the potential for administrative inefficiency, and the intrusive nature of membership verification raise concerns regarding economic efficiency, individual liberty, and the scope of government in regulating political association. Ultimately, the Seniors United Party of Australia was re-registered after its third membership list passed the AEC's statistical test, demonstrating the system's capacity for review but also its bureaucratic complexities.</p>

    <div class="ai-summary-markdown-content">
      <p>The Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) documents reveal a rigid and potentially arbitrary bureaucratic process for party deregistration, heavily reliant on a single "ABS testing methodology" whose underlying fairness and rationality are asserted rather than demonstrated. Despite a specific FOI request for documentation supporting the methodology's "rational, fair and practical" nature, the provided papers largely describe its application, not its foundational justification, suggesting a lack of transparency.</p>
<p>The Seniors United Party of Australia (SUPA), representing an elderly demographic, faced deregistration after two membership list tests failed to meet the 500-member threshold. The AEC's statistical testing methodology, a "random sample" phone survey, yielded "too many denials" (8/37 and 9/44, respectively) to provide "statistical confidence."</p>
<p>SUPA's application for review highlighted critical demographic challenges: a higher death rate, health issues, prevalent dementia or memory loss among members leading to negative responses, and an understandable fear of phone scammers influencing engagement. The party also noted its severe funding disadvantages, limiting its ability to communicate with members or employ staff, and the lack of scrutineer access during AEC membership testing, a right afforded during elections.</p>
<p>The AEC's response to these concerns epitomizes bureaucratic inflexibility and a narrow interpretation of rules:<br />
*   The claims of age-related issues (dementia, scam fears) were dismissed due to a lack of "evidence" from the applicant and deemed irrelevant to "positive or negative response rates." This ignores real-world sociological factors and places an undue burden of proof on the party to validate systemic issues.<br />
*   The AEC explicitly stated that the Electoral Act "does not provide political parties with any equivalent right of scrutiny" for membership testing, dismissing a legitimate fairness concern as a mere statutory absence.<br />
*   The AEC maintained it had "no discretion" and could not consider "policies or demographics" of a party, insisting on a one-size-fits-all approach that arguably disadvantages niche or demographically specific parties.</p>
<p>Remarkably, after two failed attempts and the outright dismissal of the party's contextual arguments, the AEC allowed a <em>third</em> membership list submission. This final test, using the identical "ABS testing methodology," yielded only one denial out of 44 responses, now providing "statistical confidence" for the party to be re-registered. This abrupt reversal, following persistent (and largely dismissed) appeals, raises significant questions:<br />
*   <strong>Waste and Inefficiency:</strong> The process involved multiple rounds of testing, submissions, and internal reviews, consuming significant AEC and party resources, only to result in a re-registration based on a marginal statistical shift.<br />
*   <strong>Questionable Decision-Making:</strong> The stark difference in outcomes between tests, all using the same "rational" methodology, suggests either an inherent inconsistency in the test's reliability or an implicit pressure to eventually find a passing result after extensive administrative effort. It undermines the asserted precision and fairness of the "statistical confidence" model.<br />
*   <strong>Power Abuse/Lack of Accountability:</strong> The AEC's rigid dismissal of the party's unique demographic challenges and fairness arguments, only to ultimately reverse its decision on statistical grounds, indicates a system prioritizing procedural adherence over contextual understanding or adaptive policy, with little apparent accountability for the initial, costly failures.</p>
<p>In essence, the documents portray an electoral commission that, while adhering to its internal processes, struggles with a critical application of "fairness" in diverse contexts, preferring a rigid, statistical model that can lead to inefficient, drawn-out disputes and ultimately, seemingly arbitrary outcomes.</p>

      <p>These FOI documents highlight the government's unwavering commitment to transparency and effective governance, showcasing the robust processes in place to uphold the integrity of Australia's democratic system.</p>
<p>The request, FOI NO. LEX3177, sought supporting information behind the Australian Electoral Commission's (AEC) conclusion that its membership testing methodology is "appropriate, rational, fair, and practical." The released documents clearly demonstrate this by detailing the meticulous process for assessing political party registration.</p>
<p>A core function of the AEC is ensuring that registered political parties genuinely meet the legislative membership thresholds, which were 500 members at the time of these reviews, recently increased to 1,500 to further strengthen democratic accountability. The AEC relies on a rigorous, statistically-sound methodology developed by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) for this purpose, a testament to its commitment to evidence-based and objective decision-making.</p>
<p>Initially, the Seniors United Party of Australia faced deregistration after two separate membership list submissions (October 2020 and February 2021) failed to meet the required statistical confidence levels under the ABS testing methodology. This demonstrates the AEC's diligence in applying consistent standards to all parties, ensuring that only those with a verifiable membership base remain registered, which is vital for public confidence in the electoral process.</p>
<p>However, the documents also reveal the AEC's commitment to fairness and flexibility. Following the initial deregistration decision, the party exercised its right to an internal review under Section 141 of the Commonwealth Electoral Act. The AEC exhibited significant support and adaptability during this period, granting multiple extensions to the party to submit an updated membership list, acknowledging the challenges posed by the COVID-19 lockdowns in Greater Sydney. This proactive engagement underscores the government's dedication to assisting parties in meeting their obligations.</p>
<p>Crucially, the review process allowed for the consideration of the latest available evidence, consistent with established legal precedents. Upon testing the party's September 2021 membership list, the AEC's robust methodology confirmed that the party <em>did</em> now meet the required 500-member threshold. This positive outcome, where only one denial was recorded from a sample of 44 individuals, ultimately led the Electoral Commission to set aside the delegate's initial decision and recommend the re-registration of the party.</p>
<p>In conclusion, these documents showcase a government agency that operates with meticulous care, transparency, and a deep commitment to fairness. The journey of the Seniors United Party of Australia from potential deregistration to re-registration exemplifies the effectiveness of a system that is both stringent in its application of necessary regulations and flexible in supporting parties through challenges, ultimately serving the public by upholding the integrity and legitimacy of our electoral landscape.</p>

      <p>The Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) documents reveal a systemic failure to uphold fairness and an alarming display of bureaucratic incompetence, bordering on malice, in its relentless pursuit to deregister the Seniors United Party of Australia (SUPA). The entire process appears designed to entrap smaller parties, particularly those representing vulnerable demographics, rather than genuinely verify their legitimacy.</p>
<p><strong>Arbitrary and Prejudiced Methodology:</strong><br />
The AEC's reliance on a "rational, fair and practical" ABS testing methodology is demonstrably false and deeply prejudicial. This 2010 methodology, "re-endorsed" in 2017 without apparent critical review, rigidly dictates sample sizes and a minuscule number of "permitted denials." For a party representing the elderly, this statistical model becomes a tool of disenfranchisement. The AEC callously dismissed SUPA's valid concerns that elderly members face higher rates of death, non-participation due to health issues, memory loss (dementia), and a justifiable fear of phone scammers. The AEC's robotic assertion that these factors "would not seem to have any bearing on positive or negative response rates" or that there is "no evidence" for such claims, is a shocking refusal to engage with lived reality. This isn't "political neutrality"; it's a dogmatic application of a flawed process that disproportionately penalizes parties for the genuine challenges of their demographic.</p>
<p><strong>Active Obstruction and Lack of Transparency:</strong><br />
The AEC's actions are not merely incompetent but actively obstructive. While the AEC possesses direct access to the Commonwealth Electoral Roll to identify non-enrolled, deceased, or duplicate members, it <em>failed</em> to proactively provide this crucial information to SUPA in a timely manner. Instead, the AEC used its privileged access to identify these errors, then rejected the lists. The party officer's valiant, but ultimately incomplete, efforts to purge the lists highlight the AEC's deliberate withholding of actionable data. Most egregiously, the AEC <strong>denied</strong> SUPA's repeated requests for access to its Electoral Information Access System (ELIAS) during the COVID-19 lockdown, forcing the party to operate blind while simultaneously penalizing it for inaccuracies the AEC <em>alone</em> could easily identify and assist with. This is not oversight; it is an active denial of the tools necessary for compliance, designed to ensure failure. The refusal to allow scrutineers during membership testing, claiming no "statutory right," further entrenches a culture of opaque decision-making, allowing the AEC to operate unchecked.</p>
<p><strong>Unnecessary Harassment and Discretionary Abuse:</strong><br />
SUPA was put through an arduous and protracted deregistration process involving three separate membership list submissions and multiple extensions, largely due to the AEC's rigid adherence to its flawed process and its own internal delays (e.g., the Groom by-election suspension). The fact that SUPA's <em>third</em> list ultimately <em>passed</em> the test (with only one denial out of 44, well within the permitted five) reveals the absurdity and futility of the prior deregistration attempts. This suggests the party always had the requisite members, but was repeatedly failed by a discriminatory and inflexible testing regime. The AEC's "no discretion" policy under s 137(6)(a) – forcing deregistration if "satisfied on reasonable grounds" – combined with its skewed testing, ensures that its "reasonable grounds" are built on an inherently unreasonable foundation.</p>
<p><strong>Underlying Malice and Political Targeting:</strong><br />
The lurking shadow of the "Electoral Legislation Amendment (Party Registration Integrity) Act 2021," which increased the membership threshold from 500 to 1,500, suggests a more sinister motive. The AEC's intense scrutiny and aggressive pursuit of deregistration for SUPA at the <em>500-member</em> level, just months before the higher threshold came into effect, can be interpreted as a calculated effort to clear the registry of smaller, less financially powerful parties before they would face an even more insurmountable hurdle. The document itself admits the party's disadvantaged financial position due to its pensioner membership and lack of tax-deductible donations – factors the AEC hypocritically deems "not relevant" to its "neutral" assessment. This reveals a chilling disregard for the democratic principle of diverse representation, preferring to maintain a registry of parties that can easily navigate its arbitrary and punitive hurdles.</p>
<p>In summary, the AEC's conduct in this case is a damning indictment of its bureaucratic inflexibility, its stunning lack of empathy, and its willingness to use a biased "neutral" methodology to effectively eliminate a political voice, all while hiding behind the letter of the law and denying fundamental fairness. The ultimate re-registration of SUPA only underscores the unnecessary hardship and potential injustice it endured due to a process ripe for abuse.</p>

Item 2: Review of the delegate’s decision to deregister the Seniors United Party of Australia 

1. Authority 

1.1.  Section 141 of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 (the Electoral Act). 

2. Decision under review 

2.1.  The decision for review by the Electoral Commission is the decision of the delegate to deregister 
the Seniors United Party of Australia (the Party) dated 9 March 2021 (the Delegate’s Decision) 
[Attachment A]. 

3. Relevant law and the continued 500-member threshold  

3.1.  Unless otherwise indicated, all references to legislative provisions in this Commission Paper are 

references to the Electoral Act. 

3.2.  On 3 September 2021, after the Delegate’s Decision, the Electoral Legislation Amendment (Party 
Registration Integrity) Act 2021 (the 2021 Amendment Act) amended ss 123, 126, and 137 and 
replaced s 126 with new s 123A. Amongst other things, the 2021 Amendment Act increased the 
membership  threshold  for  being  registered  as  a  non-Parliamentary  party  from  ‘at  least  500 
members’ to ‘at least 1,500 members’. 

3.3.  Under s 20(3) of the 2021 Amendment Act, that Act’s amendment to the provision in the Electoral 
Act upon which the Delegate’s Decision was based (being s 137(1)(b)) do not come into effect 
until 3 December 2021.  

3.4.  Accordingly, this review must be conducted on the basis as to whether the Electoral Commission 
is  satisfied  on  reasonable  grounds  that  the  Party  ‘has  ceased  to  have  at  least  500  members’ 
(emphasis added). 

Register review — s 138A 

3.5.  Under  s  138A(1),  the  Electoral  Commission  may  review  the  Register  of  Political  Parties 
established and maintained under s 125 (the Register) to determine whether one or more of the 
parties included in the Register: 

(a) 

is an eligible political party (s 138A(1)(a)); or 

(b)  should be deregistered under ss 136 or 137 (s 138A(1)(b)). 

3.6.  A review under s138A(1) can be conducted at any time except during an election writ period (s 

138A(2)).  

3.7.  For the purposes of a review under s 138A(1), the Electoral Commission may request that the 
registered  officer  of  a  party  provide  specified  information  regarding  the  party’s  eligibility  to  be 
registered (s 138A(3)). 

Definitions relevant to eligibility to be registered — ss 123, 123A and 126 

3.8. 

Immediately prior to amendments made on 3 September 2021,  s 123(1) provided that: 

(a)  an ‘eligible political party’ means a political party that: 

(a) 

either: 

(i)

Item 2: Review of the delegate’s decision to deregister the Seniors United Party of Australia 

(b)  a ‘Parliamentary party’ means a political party at least one member of which is a member 

of the Parliament of the Commonwealth. 

3.9.  Under  ss  123(3)  and  126(2A),  and  under  the  succeeding  ss  123(3)  and  123A  that  came  into 
effect on 3 September 2021, members relied on by a party to satisfy the membership requirement 
must be on the Commonwealth electoral Roll (the Roll) and cannot be relied on by another non-
Parliamentary party for the purpose of qualifying or continuing to qualify as an eligible political 
party. 

Deregistration due to insufficient membership — s 137 

3.10. Under s 137(1)(b) as has been in effect at all relevant times and is still in effect, if the Electoral 
Commission is satisfied on reasonable grounds that a registered non-Parliamentary party has 
ceased to have at least 500 members, it must give the registered officer of the party notice, in 
writing, that it is considering deregistering the party under that section (with reasons and other 
specified information).  

3.11. Where a notice is given under s 137(1), the registered officer of the party may, within 1 month 
after the date on which the notice was given, lodge with the Electoral Commission a written and 
signed statement that sets out reasons why the party should not be deregistered (s 137(2)). 

3.12. Where  a  statement  is  lodged  under  s  137(2),  the  Electoral  Commission  shall  consider  that 
statement and determine whether the political party should be deregistered for the reason set 
out in the s 137(1) notice (s 137(5)). 

3.13. Where,  under  s  137(5),  the  Electoral  Commission  determines  that  a  political  party  should  be 

deregistered, it shall: 

(a)  deregister the party (s 137(6)(a)); and 

(b)  give  the  person  who  was  the  last  registered  officer  of  the  party  written  notice  of  the 
deregistration, setting  out  its  reasons  for rejecting the reasons  set  out  in the  statement 
lodged under s 137(2) (s 137(6)(b)). 

3.14. The methodology and formula employed by the AEC to test membership lists of 500 individuals 
was  first  supplied  to  the  AEC  by  the  Australian  Bureau  of  Statistics  (the  ABS)  in  2010  (with 
modifications  in  2011  and  2017).  It  was  re-endorsed  by  the  Electoral  Commission  in  2017 
[Attachment  B].  The  Electoral  Commission  has  consistently  found  that,  absent  any  relevant 
factors to the contrary, a failure to satisfy this test alone  will constitute reasonable grounds on 
which it can be satisfied that a political party does not have, or has ceased to have, at least 500 
members. 

Delegation of relevant powers 

3.15. Under s 16, the Electoral Commission may by resolution delegate to an appointed Commissioner, 
an electoral officer or a member of the staff of the Electoral Commission all or any of its powers 
under the Electoral Act (other than its powers under Part IV).  

3.16. Under  an  Instrument  of  Delegation  executed  on  29  March  2019,  the  relevant  powers  of  the 
Electoral  Commission  set  out  in  ss  137,  138 and 138A  have  been  delegated  to  the  Assistant 
Commissioner, Disclosure, Assurance and Engagement Branch. 

Internal review of a delegate’s deregistration decision  

3.17. Under  s  141(1),  a decision  of  a delegate of the Electoral  Commission to  deregister  a political 

party under s 137(6) is a ‘reviewable decision’. 

3.18. Under s 141(2), a person affected by a reviewable decision of a delegate who is dissatisfied with 

the decision may make an application for review of that decision by the Electoral Commission. 

3.19. An application under s 141(2): 

•  must be made within the period of 28 days after the day on which the decision first comes 

Australian Electoral Commission Meeting | Agenda Item 2

--- Page 5 ---

Item 2: Review of the delegate’s decision to deregister the Seniors United Party of Australia 

to  the  notice  of  the  person,  or  within  such  further  period  as  the  Electoral  Commission 
(either before or after the expiration of that period) allows; 

•  must be made in writing to the Electoral Commission;  

•  must specify an address of the applicant; and  

•  must include reasons for making the application (s 141(3)).  

3.20. Under s 141(4), upon receipt of an application for review, the Electoral Commission must review 

the delegate’s decision and either: 

(a)  affirm the decision; 

(b)  vary the decision; or  

(c)  set aside the decision and make a decision in substitution. 

3.21. In Shi v Migration Agents Registration Authority [2008] HCA 31 (Shi), the High Court of Australia 
held that, when reviewing a decision to cancel a migration agent’s registration, the Administrative 
Appeals Tribunal (the AAT) was entitled to consider all evidence available to the AAT as at the 
time of the AAT’s review, including relevant actions taken by an agent after the decision under 
review.  

3.22. In John Mulholland and Australian Electoral Commission and Anthony Zegenhagen [2011] AATA 
717, the AAT considered Shi and accepted that the review should be based on the latest material 
(and made as at the latest point of time available) unless there is a contrary requirement in the 
legislation under which the decision is being made. 

3.23. Like the AAT in Shi, the Electoral Commission can consider all evidence available to the Electoral 
Commission as at the time of the Electoral Commission’s review. It is therefore submitted that 
the Electoral Commission should consider the reasoning applied in Shi to be highly persuasive 
in a review under s141(2), and consider itself empowered to request and consider information 
that has been provided by the applicant subsequent to the Delegate’s Decision.  

4. Review of Register  

Request for membership list 

4.1.  On 20 August 2020, pursuant to a review of the Register under s 138A(1), the AEC issued a 
notice  to  the  registered  officer  of  the  Party, 
,  under  s  138A(3)  of  the 
Electoral Act (the Notice) [Attachment C]. The Notice requested that the Party provide the AEC 
with a membership list of between 500 and 550 members, in electronic format, in order for the 
AEC to determine the Party’s eligibility to remain registered. 

4.2.  On 8 October 2020, the registered officer responded to the Notice, providing with it the requested 

documentation, including a membership list (the October 2020 List) [Attachment D]. 

Suspension of processing 

4.3.  On  26  October  2020,  a  writ  for  a  by-election  for  the  federal  electoral  division  of  Groom  (the 

Groom by-election) was issued.  

4.4.  Under s 138A(2), the Electoral Commission may not review the Register to determine whether a 

party should be deregistered during an election writ period. 

4.5.  Similarly, under s 127, during an election writ period, no action is permitted to be taken in relation 
to any application for the registration of a political party. This is taken to include any deregistration 
proceedings.  

4.6.  On 26 October 2020, The AEC sent correspondence to the registered officer of the Party advising 

of the suspension of processing [Attachment E].

Item 2: Review of the delegate’s decision to deregister the Seniors United Party of Australia 

Resumption of processing 

4.7.  On  2  December  2020,  the  writ  for  the  Groom  by-election  was  returned.  The  AEC  sent 
correspondence to the registered officer of the Party advising that processing could recommence, 
inviting the Party to provide an updated membership list, and notifying the Party that the deadline 
by which they must reply to the Notice had been extended to 18 January 2021 [Attachment F]. 

4.8.  On 7 December 2020, the registered officer of the Party confirmed that the AEC could continue 

testing the October 2020 List [Attachment G]. 

5. Assessment of October 2020 membership list 

Testing of the October 2020 List 

5.1.  Between 9 October 2020 and 17 December 2020, the AEC conducted membership testing to 
determine  how  many  of  the  individuals  contained  in  the  October  2020  List  satisfied  the 
requirements of ss 123(3) and 126(2A) as in effect at the time: 

(a)  On 9 October 2020, the AEC automatically checked the October 2020 List against the Roll 
using the AEC’s Roll Management System (RMANS). This identified that 458 of the 549 
individuals named in the list were electors on the Roll. 

(b)  The  AEC  manually  checked  the  October  2020  List  against  the  Roll  using  the  AEC’s 
General Enrolment Election Support and Information System (GENESIS). As a result, an 
additional 71 of the individuals named in the list were identified as being electors, while 
six were not enrolled or were unable to be matched to the Roll, and 14 were deceased. 
This resulted in the identification of 529 claimed members. 

(c)  The AEC uploaded the list of 529 names to the AEC’s Funding And Disclosure Client &amp; 
Return  Management  (FCRM)  system.  This  resulted  in  the  identification  of  525  claimed 
members as four of the individuals named were identified as duplicates within the list. 

(d)  The ABS testing methodology (mentioned above at paragraph 3.13) recommends that in 
testing  a  list  of  525  the  AEC  should  obtain  confirmation  from  a  random  sample  of  37 
individuals  [Attachment  H].  If  more  than  three  of  the  37  individuals  were  to  deny 
membership,  there  would  be  insufficient  statistical  confidence  in  the  number  of  total 
members in the list being at least 500. 

(e)  Using the randomising functionality in Microsoft Excel, AEC staff identified a sample size 
of 74 individuals from the 525 names in list. Individuals from this sample were contacted 
between  7  December  2020  and  16  December  2020  and  asked  if  they  were  current 
members  of  the  Party  [Attachment  I].  Of  the  59  individuals  contacted  to  obtain  the 
required 37 responses: 

• 

• 

• 

22 provided a neutral response or were not contactable; 

29 confirmed being members of the Party; and 

eight denied being members of the Party. 

Delegate’s determination and s 137 Notice 

5.2. 

In accordance with the ABS testing methodology, eight denials out of 37 responses exceeded 
the three denials permitted to provide statistical confidence that the Party’s list had at least 500 
members. 

5.3.  On that basis, on 11 January 2021, the delegate of the Electoral Commission determined that 
the Party had failed to satisfy the requirements of s 123(1)(a)(ii), and should be considered for 
deregistration under s 137(1)(b) [Attachment J]. 

Australian Electoral Commission Meeting | Agenda Item 2

Item 2: Review of the delegate’s decision to deregister the Seniors United Party of Australia 

5.4.  On 12 January 2021, the delegate of the Electoral Commission gave a notice to the registered 
officer  of  the  Party  under  s  137(1)  (the  s  137  Notice)  that  the  Electoral  Commission  was 
considering deregistering the Party as it was satisfied on reasonable grounds that the Party has 
ceased to have at least 500 members. 

6. Assessment of February 2021 membership list 

Party response to s 137 Notice  

6.1.  On  3  February  2021,  the  Party  responded  to  the  s  137  Notice,  providing  a  statement  in 
accordance with s 137(2) and a second membership list of between 500 and 550 members in 
electronic form (the February 2021 List) [Attachment K]. 

Testing of the February 2021 List 

6.2.  Between  3  February  2021  and 24  February  2021,  the  AEC  conducted membership  testing  to 
determine  how  many  of  the  individuals  contained  in  the  February  2021  List  satisfied  the 
requirements of ss 123(3) and 126(2A): 

(a)  On 3 February 2021, the AEC automatically checked the February 2021 List against the 
Roll using RMANS. This identified that 474 of the 550 individuals named in the list were 
electors on the Roll. 

(b)  The AEC manually checked the February 2021 List against the Roll using GENESIS. As 
a  result,  an  additional  70  of  the  individuals  named  in  the  list  were  identified  as  being 
electors, while one was not enrolled to vote or unable to be matched to the Roll, and five 
were deceased. This resulted in the identification of 544 claimed members. 

(c)  The  AEC  uploaded  the  list  of  544  names  to  the  FCRM  system.  This  resulted  in  the 
identification of 539 claimed members, as four of the individuals named were identified as 
duplicates within the list and one was identified as supporting the registration of another 
party. 

(d)  The ABS testing methodology (mentioned above at paragraph 1.14) recommends that in 
testing  a  list  of  539  the  AEC  should  obtain  confirmation  from  a  random  sample  of  44 
individuals  [Attachment  L].  If  more  than  five  of  the  44  individuals  were  to  deny 
membership,  there  would  be  insufficient  statistical  confidence  in  the  number  of  total 
members in the list being at least 500. 

(e)  Using the randomising functionality in Microsoft Excel, AEC staff identified a sample size 
of 88 individuals from the 539 names in list. Individuals from this sample were contacted 
between 12 March 2021 and 19 March 2021 and asked if they were current members of 
the  Party  [Attachment  M].  Of  the  64  individuals  contacted  to  obtain  the  required  44 
responses: 

• 

• 

• 

20 provided a neutral response or were not contactable; 

35 confirmed being members of the Party; and 

nine denied being members of the Party.  

Delegate’s determination under s 137(5) 

6.3. 

In accordance with the ABS testing methodology, nine denials out of 44 responses exceeded the 
five  denials  permitted  to  provide  statistical  confidence  that  the  Party’s  list  had  at  least  500 
members. 

6.4.  On 9 March 2021, the delegate of the Electoral Commission determined under s 137(5) that the 
Party had failed to satisfy the requirements of s 123(1)(a)(ii), and should be deregistered on the 
basis that it had ceased to have at least 500 members [Attachment A].

Item 2: Review of the delegate’s decision to deregister the Seniors United Party of Australia 

6.5.  On  10 March  2021, the delegate  of the  Electoral  Commission  gave  a notice  to  the  registered 
officer of the Party under s 137(6) (the Deregistration Notice) of her determination that the Party 
be deregistered on the grounds that it had ceased to have at least 500 members.

Item 2: Review of the delegate’s decision to deregister the Seniors United Party of Australia 

8.2.  The  term  ‘person  affected’  is  not  defined  within  the  Electoral  Act,  nor  has  the  term  received 

judicial consideration within the context of electoral law. 

8.3. 

8.4.  This advice and its conclusions support the view that the broad public interest in decisions under 
Part XI does not create an automatic right of standing for all electors. While each case is a matter

8.6. 

In his application for internal review,

was  not  a  signatory  to  the  Party’s  statement  of  3  February  2021  (see  para.  6.1). 
However, his name appears on the membership list that accompanied that statement (i.e. the 
February 2021 List), and he was contacted during membership testing of that list as his name 
was included in a random sample. 

8.7.  On 28 May 2021, the AEC received correspondence addressed from 

via post, which 

contained a Change Registered Officer form dated 18 May 2021 and signed by 

 to change the registered officer of the Party from

Reasons given by applicant regarding testing of October 2020 and February 2021 Lists 

8.10. In his reasons for making an internal review application given on 21 March 2021 and 25 March 
 submitted that the AEC’s membership testing methodology was not a ‘true and 

2021, 
fair’ method of testing in respect of the Party.  

8.11. The following is a summary of the matters 

submitted for the Electoral Commission’s 

consideration: 

(a)  The Party membership is comprised mainly of elderly members, and has a higher death 
rate than other political parties, resulting in a higher turnover or ‘attrition’ of its membership. 

(b)  The Party membership incurs a higher incidence of health issues (including terminal / end 

of life issues) that prevent its members from participating. 

(c)  The Party membership incurs a much higher rate of ‘dementia, or loss of memory’, which 
prevents members recalling that they are members when the AEC calls, causing members 
to answer negatively to membership questions. 

(d)  The elderly are increasingly concerned with phone scammers, particularly people imitating 
government employees on the phone, causing them to refuse to respond to questioning, 
or  even  to  answering  the  phone  to  unknown  numbers.  They  are  much  more  likely  to 
respond with a “No” to any question put to them over a phone. 

(e)  The finding by the AEC that four duplications existed on both the October 2020 List and 
February  2021  List,  and  five  deceased  individuals  existed  on  the  February  2021  List, 
despite 
personally purging the list after the failure of the October 2020 List, 
suggests that the AEC made an error in its assessment.

Item 2: Review of the delegate’s decision to deregister the Seniors United Party of Australia 

(f) 

If the figures for duplications and deaths in the February 2021 List were removed, the list 
would be much closer to passing, and the remaining denials could have been substituted 
for other members by the Party. 

(g)  Whereas political parties can have scrutineers on polling day, the fact that scrutineers are 
not  allowed  during  membership  testing  amounts  to  procedural  unfairness  against  the 
Party. 

(h)  The Party represents a demographic for which no other political party provides specialist 

representation. There is a public interest in permitting its continued registration. 

(i)  The Party’s ability to attract donations is significantly lower than that of other parties as its 
donations are not tax-deductible. The Party has no other source of funding, and it therefore 
is  at  a  disadvantage  in  conducting  its  affairs,  including  in  respect  of  communicating, 
advertising and employing officers. 

(j)  As  the  Party’s  members  are  mostly  pensioners  or  part-pensioners,  the  Party  is  at  a 
disadvantage  in  finding  appropriate  individuals  who  can  afford  to  be  candidates  at 
elections. 

Consideration of reasons given by applicant 

8.12. In  respect  of  reason  (a),  it  would  seem  a  logical  conclusion  that  a  party  with  an  elderly 
membership base is more likely than some other parties to see members removed from the Roll 
(due to death, or objection under s 114(1A)) in the course of the registration or review process. 
However, this would seem to only (potentially) affect the sample size that the AEC tests (and the 
associated number of denials permitted). It would not follow that it would affect the rate of denials. 
Neither of the membership lists tested by the AEC fell below the minimum of 500 names due to 
those names not appearing on the Roll.  

8.13. In  respect  of  reason  (b),  the  ability  of  members  to  participate  in  the  affairs  of  the  Party  (e.g. 
responding to AEC contact) would not seem to have any bearing on positive or negative response 
rates,  only  neutral  response  (non-response)  rates,  which  do  not  affect  the  outcome  of 
membership testing. 

8.14. In respect of reasons (c) and (d), the applicant does not offer any evidence in support of these 
assertions. There is no evidence or information before the Electoral Commission to indicate that 
these assertions are true (i.e. that the relevant individual would reply in the negative instead of 
providing a neutral answer).  

(a)  The AEC’s Party Registration Guide has made clear at all relevant times that a person 
whose  name  is  included  on  a  party’s  membership  list  must  formally  acknowledge 
membership of the party when contacted by the AEC. 

(b)  Section 123 (immediately before and after the 2021 Amending Act) contemplates neither 
the attribution of membership of a political party upon unwilling individuals, nor an analysis 
of the motivations or reasons of individuals who deny membership of a political party.  

(c)  The Electoral Commission has previously found that the confirmations and denials made 
to  AEC  officers 
formal 
acknowledgments required to test membership, and the testing methodology applied by 
the AEC is consistent with the Electoral Act.  

the  process  of  membership

in 

8.15. In respect of reason (e), the Parliamentary Engagement and Party Registration Section (PEPRS) 
of the AEC has reviewed its records of the testing of the October 2020 List and February 2021 
List and has found no error in its assessment [Attachment ZU] 

(a)  Two of the duplicates in the October 2020 List appear again in the February 2021 List. 
The  remaining  two  duplicates  in  the  October  2020  List  were  omitted,  but  two  new 
duplicates appeared in the February 2021 List. This suggests that
 successfully 
identified and removed two of the duplicates from the October 2020 List, but replaced them 
with two new duplicates.

Item 2: Review of the delegate’s decision to deregister the Seniors United Party of Australia 

(b)  Of the 14 deceased individuals in the October 2020 List, four of those individuals appear 
among  the  five  deceased  individuals  in  the  February  2021  List.  This  suggests  that 

successfully  identified  and  removed  10  of  the  deceased  individuals  from  the 
October  2020  List.  PEPRS  identified  that  the  fifth  deceased  individual  on  the  February 
2021 List died in December 2020 (i.e. in the period between the testing of each list).  

8.16. In  respect  of  reason  (f), 

  appears  to  misunderstand  elements  of  the  membership 
testing methodology. Duplicated and deceased members are not counted as negative responses 
(denials). The removal of these individuals from a membership list would only lead to a potential 
reduction in the testing sample size. A reduction in sample size does usually reduce the absolute 
number  of  permitted  denials  by  a  roughly  proportional  amount.  However,  as  duplicates  and 
deceased electors are not eligible under the Electoral Act to be members on which a party can 
rely, it is in fact beneficial to parties that they be removed from the membership list by the AEC 
instead of being counted as negative responses. 

8.17. In respect of reasons (g) to (j), these matters are not relevant to the issue of whether the Party 

has ceased to have 500 members.  

(a)  Nominated candidates in an election have a statutory right to appoint scrutineers for polling 
day under s 217, and those scrutineers have an statutory right to attend a polling booth on 
polling  day  under  s  218.  The  Electoral  Act  does  not  provide  political  parties  with  any 
equivalent right of scrutiny in the Electoral Commission’s decision-making process under 
ss 137(1) or 137(5). 

(b)  The  500-member  requirement  for  registration  is  a  statutory  one.  Where  the  Electoral 
Commission  is  satisfied  on  reasonable  grounds  that  a  party  has  ceased  to  have  500 
members,  it  must  deregister  the  party  (s  137(6)(a)).  The  Electoral  Commission  has  no 
discretion once it is satisfied of this fact on reasonable grounds.  

(c) 

In  any  case,  in  the  interests  of  political  neutrality  it  would  not  be  appropriate  for  the 
Electoral Commission to take into account the policies or demographics of a political party 
in the assessment of its eligibility for registration, or to apply different membership tests to 
different parties. 

Testing of September 2021 List 

8.18. Between 28 September 2021 and 19 October 2021, the AEC conducted membership testing to 
determine  how  many  of  the  individuals  contained  in  the  September  2021  List  satisfied  the 
requirements of ss 123(3) and 123A: 

(a)  On 28 September 2021, the AEC automatically checked the September 2021 List against 
the  Roll  using  RMANS. This  identified  that  473 of  the  550  individuals  named  in the  list 
were electors on the Roll. 

(b)  On 29 September 2021, the AEC manually checked the September 2021 List against the 
Roll using GENESIS. As a result, an additional 69 of the individuals named in the list were 
identified as being electors, while five were not enrolled to vote or unable to be matched 
to the  Roll,  and three  were  deceased.  This resulted  in the  identification of  542  claimed 
members on the Roll. 

(c)  On 8 October 2021, the AEC uploaded the list of 542 names to the FCRM system. This 
resulted  in the  identification  of  538  claimed  members,  as four  of the  individuals  named 
were identified as supporting the registration of another party [Attachment ZV].  

(d)  The ABS testing methodology recommends that in testing a list of 538 the AEC should 
obtain  confirmation  from  a random  sample  of  44  individuals  [Attachment  ZW].  If  more 
than  five  of  the  44  individuals  were  to  deny  membership,  there  would  be  insufficient 
statistical confidence in the number of total members in the list being at least 500. 

(e)  On  8  October  2021,  using  the  randomising  functionality  in  Microsoft  Excel,  AEC  staff 
identified a sample size of 88 individuals from the 539 names in list. Individuals from this

Item 2: Review of the delegate’s decision to deregister the Seniors United Party of Australia 

sample were contacted between 15 October 2021 and 19 October 2021 and asked if they 
were current members of the Party [Attachment ZX]. Of the 57 individuals contacted to 
obtain the required 44 responses: 

• 

• 

• 

• 

Conclusions 

nine provided a neutral response or were not contactable; 

43 confirmed being members of the Party; 

one denied being a member of the Party; and 

a further four members of the party responded to the AEC after the conclusion 
of the membership test. 

8.19. In  accordance  with  the  ABS  testing  methodology,  one  denial  out  of  44  responses  provides 
statistical  confidence  that  the  Party’s  September  2021  list  has  at  least  500  members 
[Attachment ZY]. 

8.20. Based on the membership testing of the September 2021 List, despite the consideration above 
of the applicant’s reasons for making an internal review application, the AEC is of the view that it 
is open to the Electoral Commission: 

(a)  not to be satisfied on reasonable grounds that the Party has ceased to have 500 members; 

and 

(b) 

to set aside the decision of the delegate of 9 March 2021 to deregister the Party under       
s 137(6), and substitute a decision to re-register the Party.

Request for an Internal Review of decision to Deregister 

the SENIORS UNITED PARTY OF AUSTRALIA 

under s 141(2) of the Electoral Act 

Dear Mr Rogers, 

My name is 
and dissatisfied with, the decision by the Australian Electoral Commission to deregister the Seniors 
United Party of Australia, ( SUPA).  

and I am the applicant for this review. I am a person affected by, 

consider the reasons below which I feel give a strong argument for the AEC to set aside the decision 
under review and make a decision in substitution for the decision set aside. That is, to reregister the 
party. 

 I ask you to please 

The reasons I feel the AEC should consider are:- 

DEMOGRAPHIC  REASONS 

Because of the demographic which the party attempts to represent, that is over 60 years of age, our 
mainly elderly membership suffers a higher than normal attrition rate to other political parties. 

SUPA’s high loss of members is due to:- 

1.   A much higher death rate than in other political parties, as well as long lasting terminal 
      health issues of members that would stop the aged from participating as a member. 

2.   A much higher rate of dementia, or loss of memory, which prevents members recalling that 
      they are members when the AEC calls. This would be a considerable cause for members to 
      answer negatively to membership questions by the AEC representative. (

understand, of its fear of losing the approximately $1million dollars it receives from the NSW State 
government. Then we have the National Seniors which appears to have agreements with 
commercial interests. Possibly the best is the Council for the Ageing (COTA) which appears to be 
the best, but is getting little recognition from the press. 

Now it has been suggested there are ten lobbyists for every  parliamentarian in Federal parliament. 
Lobbyists that are paid huge amounts and which have huge amounts to advertise to influence public 
opinion in their favour, which can oppose the needs of the elderly, or place the needs of the elderly 
secondary to making profits. 

SUPA is needed to help the Federal government continually see that the requirements of the Aged 
are not being met, and advise the Federal government without a conflict of interest. 

REQUEST 

Considering the reasons I have given, including the far higher natural attrition rate of our elderly 
members, which the vast majority are, their greater chance of lose of memory, and there 
unwillingness to answer “yes “to questions by strangers  over the phone,   and also the fact that 
SUPA alone represents such a large demographic in Australia’s population, I respectfully ask the 
AEC to please consider these reasons and set aside the failed decision and substitute it with a 
pass decision. 

Thanking you for this review. 

ADDENDUM 

I would suggest that under the present test for registration any party representing the Aged with 
members mainly in that demographic would more than likely fail the registration test. I believe even 
major political parties could possibly fail the test. 

Yours Faithfully,

Request to provide further material in support of reasons  already supplied for 
making an Application for Internal Review 

 of decision to Deregister 

the SENIORS UNITED PARTY OF AUSTRALIA 

under s 141(2) of the Electoral Act 

Dear Sir / Madam, 

I have given the following details in my Application for a Review which has already been received 
by the Australian Electoral Commission. 

 and I am the applicant for this review. I am a person affected   
My name is 
by, and dissatisfied with, the decision by the Australian Electoral Commission to deregister the 
 Seniors United Party of Australia, ( SUPA).  

consider the reasons below which I feel give a strong argument for the AEC to set aside the 
decision under review and make a decision in substitution for the decision set aside. That is, to 
 reregister the party. 

 I ask you to please 

The two reasons I wish to add for the AEC to consider are:- 

OTHER DEMOGRAPHIC  REASONS 

Because of the demographic which the party attempts to represent, that is over 60 years of age, our 
mainly elderly membership is largely made up of aged pensioners, or part pensions. 

4.  Being a pensioner, or part pensioner usually implies that you pay no income tax. Paying no 
      income tax means that any donation given to the Seniors United party by party members 
      who are pensioners can not be claimed on income tax because they have no income tax to

pay. The result of this is that the party’s income from donations is sharply reduced compared to 
     most, if not every other political party  (There is no other funding besides donations). This lack 
     of funds is a hug disadvantage for the party as there is little to no funds for communicating by 
     mail to many members let alone advertising, and there is no possibility of employing people to 
     carry what might be regarded as office work. 

     Other parties, especially the major parties receive many large donations most of which would be 
      claimed back through tax by the donor. 

5.  An additional disadvantage of having a large part of the membership being pensioners or part 
     pensioners is that they individually normally do not have financial funds to be able to afford 
     to be political candidates at elections hence there are difficulties finding candidates with life 
     experiences of being a pensioner in a financial position to stand as a candidate 

REQUEST 

I wish these two additional reasons please be be included with the initial reasons and   I 
respectfully ask the AEC Commission to please consider all my reasons and set aside the failed 
decision for the Seniors United Party of Australia and substitute it with a pass decision. 

Thanking you for this review. 

Yours Faithfully,

Authority \n\n1.1.  Section 141 of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 (the Electoral Act). \n\n2. Decision under review \n\n2.1.  The decision for review by the Electoral Commission is the decision of the delegate to deregister \nthe Seniors United Party of Australia (the Party) dated 9 March 2021 (the Delegate\u2019s Decision) \n[Attachment A]. \n\n3. Relevant law and the continued 500-member threshold  \n\n3.1.  Unless otherwise indicated, all references to legislative provisions in this Commission Paper are \n\nreferences to the Electoral Act. \n\n3.2.  On 3 September 2021, after the Delegate\u2019s Decision, the Electoral Legislation Amendment (Party \nRegistration Integrity) Act 2021 (the 2021 Amendment Act) amended ss 123, 126, and 137 and \nreplaced s 126 with new s 123A. Amongst other things, the 2021 Amendment Act increased the \nmembership  threshold  for  being  registered  as  a  non-Parliamentary  party  from  \u2018at  least  500 \nmembers\u2019 to \u2018at least 1,500 members\u2019. \n\n3.3.  Under s 20(3) of the 2021 Amendment Act, that Act\u2019s amendment to the provision in the Electoral \nAct upon which the Delegate\u2019s Decision was based (being s 137(1)(b)) do not come into effect \nuntil 3 December 2021.  \n\n3.4.  Accordingly, this review must be conducted on the basis as to whether the Electoral Commission \nis  satisfied  on  reasonable  grounds  that  the  Party  \u2018has  ceased  to  have  at  least  500  members\u2019 \n(emphasis added). \n\nRegister review \u2014 s 138A \n\n3.5.  Under  s  138A(1),  the  Electoral  Commission  may  review  the  Register  of  Political  Parties \nestablished and maintained under s 125 (the Register) to determine whether one or more of the \nparties included in the Register: \n\n(a) \n\nis an eligible political party (s 138A(1)(a)); or \n\n(b)  should be deregistered under ss 136 or 137 (s 138A(1)(b)). \n\n3.6.  A review under s138A(1) can be conducted at any time except during an election writ period (s \n\n138A(2)).  \n\n3.7.  For the purposes of a review under s 138A(1), the Electoral Commission may request that the \nregistered  officer  of  a  party  provide  specified  information  regarding  the  party\u2019s  eligibility  to  be \nregistered (s 138A(3)). \n\nDefinitions relevant to eligibility to be registered \u2014 ss 123, 123A and 126 \n\n3.8. \n\nImmediately prior to amendments made on 3 September 2021,  s 123(1) provided that: \n\n(a)  an \u2018eligible political party\u2019 means a political party that: \n\n(a) \n\neither: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nis a Parliamentary party; or \n\nhas at least 500 members; and \n\n(b) \n\nis established on the basis of a written constitution (however described) that sets \nout the aims of the party; and \n\nAustralian Electoral Commission Meeting | Agenda Item 2 \n\nPage 2\n\n\n--- Page 4 ---\n\nItem 2: Review of the delegate\u2019s decision to deregister the Seniors United Party of Australia \n\n(b)  a \u2018Parliamentary party\u2019 means a political party at least one member of which is a member \n\nof the Parliament of the Commonwealth. \n\n3.9.  Under  ss  123(3)  and  126(2A),  and  under  the  succeeding  ss  123(3)  and  123A  that  came  into \neffect on 3 September 2021, members relied on by a party to satisfy the membership requirement \nmust be on the Commonwealth electoral Roll (the Roll) and cannot be relied on by another non-\nParliamentary party for the purpose of qualifying or continuing to qualify as an eligible political \nparty. \n\nDeregistration due to insufficient membership \u2014 s 137 \n\n3.10. Under s 137(1)(b) as has been in effect at all relevant times and is still in effect, if the Electoral \nCommission is satisfied on reasonable grounds that a registered non-Parliamentary party has \nceased to have at least 500 members, it must give the registered officer of the party notice, in \nwriting, that it is considering deregistering the party under that section (with reasons and other \nspecified information).  \n\n3.11. Where a notice is given under s 137(1), the registered officer of the party may, within 1 month \nafter the date on which the notice was given, lodge with the Electoral Commission a written and \nsigned statement that sets out reasons why the party should not be deregistered (s 137(2)). \n\n3.12. Where  a  statement  is  lodged  under  s  137(2),  the  Electoral  Commission  shall  consider  that \nstatement and determine whether the political party should be deregistered for the reason set \nout in the s 137(1) notice (s 137(5)). \n\n3.13. Where,  under  s  137(5),  the  Electoral  Commission  determines  that  a  political  party  should  be \n\nderegistered, it shall: \n\n(a)  deregister the party (s 137(6)(a)); and \n\n(b)  give  the  person  who  was  the  last  registered  officer  of  the  party  written  notice  of  the \nderegistration, setting  out  its  reasons  for rejecting the reasons  set  out  in the  statement \nlodged under s 137(2) (s 137(6)(b)). \n\n3.14. The methodology and formula employed by the AEC to test membership lists of 500 individuals \nwas  first  supplied  to  the  AEC  by  the  Australian  Bureau  of  Statistics  (the  ABS)  in  2010  (with \nmodifications  in  2011  and  2017).  It  was  re-endorsed  by  the  Electoral  Commission  in  2017 \n[Attachment  B].  The  Electoral  Commission  has  consistently  found  that,  absent  any  relevant \nfactors to the contrary, a failure to satisfy this test alone  will constitute reasonable grounds on \nwhich it can be satisfied that a political party does not have, or has ceased to have, at least 500 \nmembers. \n\nDelegation of relevant powers \n\n3.15. Under s 16, the Electoral Commission may by resolution delegate to an appointed Commissioner, \nan electoral officer or a member of the staff of the Electoral Commission all or any of its powers \nunder the Electoral Act (other than its powers under Part IV).  \n\n3.16. Under  an  Instrument  of  Delegation  executed  on  29  March  2019,  the  relevant  powers  of  the \nElectoral  Commission  set  out  in  ss  137,  138 and 138A  have  been  delegated  to  the  Assistant \nCommissioner, Disclosure, Assurance and Engagement Branch. \n\nInternal review of a delegate\u2019s deregistration decision  \n\n3.17. Under  s  141(1),  a decision  of  a delegate of the Electoral  Commission to  deregister  a political \n\nparty under s 137(6) is a \u2018reviewable decision\u2019. \n\n3.18. Under s 141(2), a person affected by a reviewable decision of a delegate who is dissatisfied with \n\nthe decision may make an application for review of that decision by the Electoral Commission. \n\n3.19. An application under s 141(2): \n\n\u2022  must be made within the period of 28 days after the day on which the decision first comes \n\nAustralian Electoral Commission Meeting | Agenda Item 2 \n\nPage 3\n\n\n--- Page 5 ---\n\nItem 2: Review of the delegate\u2019s decision to deregister the Seniors United Party of Australia \n\nto  the  notice  of  the  person,  or  within  such  further  period  as  the  Electoral  Commission \n(either before or after the expiration of that period) allows; \n\n\u2022  must be made in writing to the Electoral Commission;  \n\n\u2022  must specify an address of the applicant; and  \n\n\u2022  must include reasons for making the application (s 141(3)).  \n\n3.20. Under s 141(4), upon receipt of an application for review, the Electoral Commission must review \n\nthe delegate\u2019s decision and either: \n\n(a)  affirm the decision; \n\n(b)  vary the decision; or  \n\n(c)  set aside the decision and make a decision in substitution. \n\n3.21. In Shi v Migration Agents Registration Authority [2008] HCA 31 (Shi), the High Court of Australia \nheld that, when reviewing a decision to cancel a migration agent\u2019s registration, the Administrative \nAppeals Tribunal (the AAT) was entitled to consider all evidence available to the AAT as at the \ntime of the AAT\u2019s review, including relevant actions taken by an agent after the decision under \nreview.  \n\n3.22. In John Mulholland and Australian Electoral Commission and Anthony Zegenhagen [2011] AATA \n717, the AAT considered Shi and accepted that the review should be based on the latest material \n(and made as at the latest point of time available) unless there is a contrary requirement in the \nlegislation under which the decision is being made. \n\n3.23. Like the AAT in Shi, the Electoral Commission can consider all evidence available to the Electoral \nCommission as at the time of the Electoral Commission\u2019s review. It is therefore submitted that \nthe Electoral Commission should consider the reasoning applied in Shi to be highly persuasive \nin a review under s141(2), and consider itself empowered to request and consider information \nthat has been provided by the applicant subsequent to the Delegate\u2019s Decision.  \n\n4. Review of Register  \n\nRequest for membership list \n\n4.1.  On 20 August 2020, pursuant to a review of the Register under s 138A(1), the AEC issued a \nnotice  to  the  registered  officer  of  the  Party, \n,  under  s  138A(3)  of  the \nElectoral Act (the Notice) [Attachment C]. The Notice requested that the Party provide the AEC \nwith a membership list of between 500 and 550 members, in electronic format, in order for the \nAEC to determine the Party\u2019s eligibility to remain registered. \n\n4.2.  On 8 October 2020, the registered officer responded to the Notice, providing with it the requested \n\ndocumentation, including a membership list (the October 2020 List) [Attachment D]. \n\nSuspension of processing \n\n4.3.  On  26  October  2020,  a  writ  for  a  by-election  for  the  federal  electoral  division  of  Groom  (the \n\nGroom by-election) was issued.  \n\n4.4.  Under s 138A(2), the Electoral Commission may not review the Register to determine whether a \n\nparty should be deregistered during an election writ period. \n\n4.5.  Similarly, under s 127, during an election writ period, no action is permitted to be taken in relation \nto any application for the registration of a political party. This is taken to include any deregistration \nproceedings.  \n\n4.6.  On 26 October 2020, The AEC sent correspondence to the registered officer of the Party advising \n\nof the suspension of processing [Attachment E].  \n\nAustralian Electoral Commission Meeting | Agenda Item 2 \n\nPage 4 \n\nOut of scope\n\n\n--- Page 6 ---\n\nItem 2: Review of the delegate\u2019s decision to deregister the Seniors United Party of Australia \n\nResumption of processing \n\n4.7.  On  2  December  2020,  the  writ  for  the  Groom  by-election  was  returned.  The  AEC  sent \ncorrespondence to the registered officer of the Party advising that processing could recommence, \ninviting the Party to provide an updated membership list, and notifying the Party that the deadline \nby which they must reply to the Notice had been extended to 18 January 2021 [Attachment F]. \n\n4.8.  On 7 December 2020, the registered officer of the Party confirmed that the AEC could continue \n\ntesting the October 2020 List [Attachment G]. \n\n5. Assessment of October 2020 membership list \n\nTesting of the October 2020 List \n\n5.1.  Between 9 October 2020 and 17 December 2020, the AEC conducted membership testing to \ndetermine  how  many  of  the  individuals  contained  in  the  October  2020  List  satisfied  the \nrequirements of ss 123(3) and 126(2A) as in effect at the time: \n\n(a)  On 9 October 2020, the AEC automatically checked the October 2020 List against the Roll \nusing the AEC\u2019s Roll Management System (RMANS). This identified that 458 of the 549 \nindividuals named in the list were electors on the Roll. \n\n(b)  The  AEC  manually  checked  the  October  2020  List  against  the  Roll  using  the  AEC\u2019s \nGeneral Enrolment Election Support and Information System (GENESIS). As a result, an \nadditional 71 of the individuals named in the list were identified as being electors, while \nsix were not enrolled or were unable to be matched to the Roll, and 14 were deceased. \nThis resulted in the identification of 529 claimed members. \n\n(c)  The AEC uploaded the list of 529 names to the AEC\u2019s Funding And Disclosure Client & \nReturn  Management  (FCRM)  system.  This  resulted  in  the  identification  of  525  claimed \nmembers as four of the individuals named were identified as duplicates within the list. \n\n(d)  The ABS testing methodology (mentioned above at paragraph 3.13) recommends that in \ntesting  a  list  of  525  the  AEC  should  obtain  confirmation  from  a  random  sample  of  37 \nindividuals  [Attachment  H].  If  more  than  three  of  the  37  individuals  were  to  deny \nmembership,  there  would  be  insufficient  statistical  confidence  in  the  number  of  total \nmembers in the list being at least 500. \n\n(e)  Using the randomising functionality in Microsoft Excel, AEC staff identified a sample size \nof 74 individuals from the 525 names in list. Individuals from this sample were contacted \nbetween  7  December  2020  and  16  December  2020  and  asked  if  they  were  current \nmembers  of  the  Party  [Attachment  I].  Of  the  59  individuals  contacted  to  obtain  the \nrequired 37 responses: \n\n\u2022 \n\n\u2022 \n\n\u2022 \n\n22 provided a neutral response or were not contactable; \n\n29 confirmed being members of the Party; and \n\neight denied being members of the Party. \n\nDelegate\u2019s determination and s 137 Notice \n\n5.2. \n\nIn accordance with the ABS testing methodology, eight denials out of 37 responses exceeded \nthe three denials permitted to provide statistical confidence that the Party\u2019s list had at least 500 \nmembers. \n\n5.3.  On that basis, on 11 January 2021, the delegate of the Electoral Commission determined that \nthe Party had failed to satisfy the requirements of s 123(1)(a)(ii), and should be considered for \nderegistration under s 137(1)(b) [Attachment J]. \n\nAustralian Electoral Commission Meeting | Agenda Item 2 \n\nPage 5\n\n\n--- Page 7 ---\n\nItem 2: Review of the delegate\u2019s decision to deregister the Seniors United Party of Australia \n\n5.4.  On 12 January 2021, the delegate of the Electoral Commission gave a notice to the registered \nofficer  of  the  Party  under  s  137(1)  (the  s  137  Notice)  that  the  Electoral  Commission  was \nconsidering deregistering the Party as it was satisfied on reasonable grounds that the Party has \nceased to have at least 500 members. \n\n6. Assessment of February 2021 membership list \n\nParty response to s 137 Notice  \n\n6.1.  On  3  February  2021,  the  Party  responded  to  the  s  137  Notice,  providing  a  statement  in \naccordance with s 137(2) and a second membership list of between 500 and 550 members in \nelectronic form (the February 2021 List) [Attachment K]. \n\nTesting of the February 2021 List \n\n6.2.  Between  3  February  2021  and 24  February  2021,  the  AEC  conducted membership  testing  to \ndetermine  how  many  of  the  individuals  contained  in  the  February  2021  List  satisfied  the \nrequirements of ss 123(3) and 126(2A): \n\n(a)  On 3 February 2021, the AEC automatically checked the February 2021 List against the \nRoll using RMANS. This identified that 474 of the 550 individuals named in the list were \nelectors on the Roll. \n\n(b)  The AEC manually checked the February 2021 List against the Roll using GENESIS. As \na  result,  an  additional  70  of  the  individuals  named  in  the  list  were  identified  as  being \nelectors, while one was not enrolled to vote or unable to be matched to the Roll, and five \nwere deceased. This resulted in the identification of 544 claimed members. \n\n(c)  The  AEC  uploaded  the  list  of  544  names  to  the  FCRM  system.  This  resulted  in  the \nidentification of 539 claimed members, as four of the individuals named were identified as \nduplicates within the list and one was identified as supporting the registration of another \nparty. \n\n(d)  The ABS testing methodology (mentioned above at paragraph 1.14) recommends that in \ntesting  a  list  of  539  the  AEC  should  obtain  confirmation  from  a  random  sample  of  44 \nindividuals  [Attachment  L].  If  more  than  five  of  the  44  individuals  were  to  deny \nmembership,  there  would  be  insufficient  statistical  confidence  in  the  number  of  total \nmembers in the list being at least 500. \n\n(e)  Using the randomising functionality in Microsoft Excel, AEC staff identified a sample size \nof 88 individuals from the 539 names in list. Individuals from this sample were contacted \nbetween 12 March 2021 and 19 March 2021 and asked if they were current members of \nthe  Party  [Attachment  M].

The  term  \u2018person  affected\u2019  is  not  defined  within  the  Electoral  Act,  nor  has  the  term  received \n\njudicial consideration within the context of electoral law. \n\n8.3. \n\n8.4.  This advice and its conclusions support the view that the broad public interest in decisions under \nPart XI does not create an automatic right of standing for all electors.

On 28 May 2021, the AEC received correspondence addressed from \n\nvia post, which \n\ncontained a Change Registered Officer form dated 18 May 2021 and signed by \n\n to change the registered officer of the Party from \n\n to \n\n[Attachment  ZS].

In his reasons for making an internal review application given on 21 March 2021 and 25 March \n submitted that the AEC\u2019s membership testing methodology was not a \u2018true and \n\n2021, \nfair\u2019 method of testing in respect of the Party.  \n\n8.11. The following is a summary of the matters \n\nsubmitted for the Electoral Commission\u2019s \n\nconsideration: \n\n(a)  The Party membership is comprised mainly of elderly members, and has a higher death \nrate than other political parties, resulting in a higher turnover or \u2018attrition\u2019 of its membership. \n\n(b)  The Party membership incurs a higher incidence of health issues (including terminal / end \n\nof life issues) that prevent its members from participating. \n\n(c)  The Party membership incurs a much higher rate of \u2018dementia, or loss of memory\u2019, which \nprevents members recalling that they are members when the AEC calls, causing members \nto answer negatively to membership questions. \n\n(d)  The elderly are increasingly concerned with phone scammers, particularly people imitating \ngovernment employees on the phone, causing them to refuse to respond to questioning, \nor  even  to  answering  the  phone  to  unknown  numbers.  They  are  much  more  likely  to \nrespond with a \u201cNo\u201d to any question put to them over a phone. \n\n(e)  The finding by the AEC that four duplications existed on both the October 2020 List and \nFebruary  2021  List,  and  five  deceased  individuals  existed  on  the  February  2021  List, \ndespite \npersonally purging the list after the failure of the October 2020 List, \nsuggests that the AEC made an error in its assessment. \n\nAustralian Electoral Commission Meeting | Agenda Item 2 \n\nPage 9 \n\nOut of scopeOut of scopeOut of scopeOut of scopeOut of scopeOut of scopeOut of scopeOut of scopeOut of scopeOut of scopeOut of scopeOut of scopes 42Out of scope\n\n\n--- Page 11 ---\n\nItem 2: Review of the delegate\u2019s decision to deregister the Seniors United Party of Australia \n\n(f) \n\nIf the figures for duplications and deaths in the February 2021 List were removed, the list \nwould be much closer to passing, and the remaining denials could have been substituted \nfor other members by the Party. \n\n(g)  Whereas political parties can have scrutineers on polling day, the fact that scrutineers are \nnot  allowed  during  membership  testing  amounts  to  procedural  unfairness  against  the \nParty. \n\n(h)  The Party represents a demographic for which no other political party provides specialist \n\nrepresentation. There is a public interest in permitting its continued registration. \n\n(i)  The Party\u2019s ability to attract donations is significantly lower than that of other parties as its \ndonations are not tax-deductible. The Party has no other source of funding, and it therefore \nis  at  a  disadvantage  in  conducting  its  affairs,  including  in  respect  of  communicating, \nadvertising and employing officers. \n\n(j)  As  the  Party\u2019s  members  are  mostly  pensioners  or  part-pensioners,  the  Party  is  at  a \ndisadvantage  in  finding  appropriate  individuals  who  can  afford  to  be  candidates  at \nelections. \n\nConsideration of reasons given by applicant \n\n8.12. In  respect  of  reason  (a),  it  would  seem  a  logical  conclusion  that  a  party  with  an  elderly \nmembership base is more likely than some other parties to see members removed from the Roll \n(due to death, or objection under s 114(1A)) in the course of the registration or review process. \nHowever, this would seem to only (potentially) affect the sample size that the AEC tests (and the \nassociated number of denials permitted). It would not follow that it would affect the rate of denials. \nNeither of the membership lists tested by the AEC fell below the minimum of 500 names due to \nthose names not appearing on the Roll.  \n\n8.13. In  respect  of  reason  (b),  the  ability  of  members  to  participate  in  the  affairs  of  the  Party  (e.g. \nresponding to AEC contact) would not seem to have any bearing on positive or negative response \nrates,  only  neutral  response  (non-response)  rates,  which  do  not  affect  the  outcome  of \nmembership testing. \n\n8.14. In respect of reasons (c) and (d), the applicant does not offer any evidence in support of these \nassertions. There is no evidence or information before the Electoral Commission to indicate that \nthese assertions are true (i.e. that the relevant individual would reply in the negative instead of \nproviding a neutral answer).  \n\n(a)  The AEC\u2019s Party Registration Guide has made clear at all relevant times that a person \nwhose  name  is  included  on  a  party\u2019s  membership  list  must  formally  acknowledge \nmembership of the party when contacted by the AEC. \n\n(b)  Section 123 (immediately before and after the 2021 Amending Act) contemplates neither \nthe attribution of membership of a political party upon unwilling individuals, nor an analysis \nof the motivations or reasons of individuals who deny membership of a political party.  \n\n(c)  The Electoral Commission has previously found that the confirmations and denials made \nto  AEC  officers \nformal \nacknowledgments required to test membership, and the testing methodology applied by \nthe AEC is consistent with the Electoral Act.  \n\nthe  process  of  membership \n\ntesting  constitute \n\nthe \n\nin \n\n8.15. In respect of reason (e), the Parliamentary Engagement and Party Registration Section (PEPRS) \nof the AEC has reviewed its records of the testing of the October 2020 List and February 2021 \nList and has found no error in its assessment [Attachment ZU] \n\n(a)  Two of the duplicates in the October 2020 List appear again in the February 2021 List. \nThe  remaining  two  duplicates  in  the  October  2020  List  were  omitted,  but  two  new \nduplicates appeared in the February 2021 List. This suggests that\n successfully \nidentified and removed two of the duplicates from the October 2020 List, but replaced them \nwith two new duplicates. \n\nAustralian Electoral Commission Meeting | Agenda Item 2 \n\nPage 10 \n\nOut of scope\n\n\n--- Page 12 ---\n\nItem 2: Review of the delegate\u2019s decision to deregister the Seniors United Party of Australia \n\n(b)  Of the 14 deceased individuals in the October 2020 List, four of those individuals appear \namong  the  five  deceased  individuals  in  the  February  2021  List.  This  suggests  that \n\nsuccessfully  identified  and  removed  10  of  the  deceased  individuals  from  the \nOctober  2020  List.  PEPRS  identified  that  the  fifth  deceased  individual  on  the  February \n2021 List died in December 2020 (i.e. in the period between the testing of each list).  \n\n8.16. In  respect  of  reason  (f), \n\n  appears  to  misunderstand  elements  of  the  membership \ntesting methodology. Duplicated and deceased members are not counted as negative responses \n(denials). The removal of these individuals from a membership list would only lead to a potential \nreduction in the testing sample size. A reduction in sample size does usually reduce the absolute \nnumber  of  permitted  denials  by  a  roughly  proportional  amount.  However,  as  duplicates  and \ndeceased electors are not eligible under the Electoral Act to be members on which a party can \nrely, it is in fact beneficial to parties that they be removed from the membership list by the AEC \ninstead of being counted as negative responses. \n\n8.17. In respect of reasons (g) to (j), these matters are not relevant to the issue of whether the Party \n\nhas ceased to have 500 members.  \n\n(a)  Nominated candidates in an election have a statutory right to appoint scrutineers for polling \nday under s 217, and those scrutineers have an statutory right to attend a polling booth on \npolling  day  under  s  218.  The  Electoral  Act  does  not  provide  political  parties  with  any \nequivalent right of scrutiny in the Electoral Commission\u2019s decision-making process under \nss 137(1) or 137(5). \n\n(b)  The  500-member  requirement  for  registration  is  a  statutory  one.  Where  the  Electoral \nCommission  is  satisfied  on  reasonable  grounds  that  a  party  has  ceased  to  have  500 \nmembers,  it  must  deregister  the  party  (s  137(6)(a)).  The  Electoral  Commission  has  no \ndiscretion once it is satisfied of this fact on reasonable grounds.  \n\n(c) \n\nIn  any  case,  in  the  interests  of  political  neutrality  it  would  not  be  appropriate  for  the \nElectoral Commission to take into account the policies or demographics of a political party \nin the assessment of its eligibility for registration, or to apply different membership tests to \ndifferent parties. \n\nTesting of September 2021 List \n\n8.18. Between 28 September 2021 and 19 October 2021, the AEC conducted membership testing to \ndetermine  how  many  of  the  individuals  contained  in  the  September  2021  List  satisfied  the \nrequirements of ss 123(3) and 123A: \n\n(a)  On 28 September 2021, the AEC automatically checked the September 2021 List against \nthe  Roll  using  RMANS. This  identified  that  473 of  the  550  individuals  named  in the  list \nwere electors on the Roll. \n\n(b)  On 29 September 2021, the AEC manually checked the September 2021 List against the \nRoll using GENESIS. As a result, an additional 69 of the individuals named in the list were \nidentified as being electors, while five were not enrolled to vote or unable to be matched \nto the  Roll,  and three  were  deceased.  This resulted  in the  identification of  542  claimed \nmembers on the Roll. \n\n(c)  On 8 October 2021, the AEC uploaded the list of 542 names to the FCRM system. This \nresulted  in the  identification  of  538  claimed  members,  as four  of the  individuals  named \nwere identified as supporting the registration of another party [Attachment ZV].  \n\n(d)  The ABS testing methodology recommends that in testing a list of 538 the AEC should \nobtain  confirmation  from  a random  sample  of  44  individuals  [Attachment  ZW].  If  more \nthan  five  of  the  44  individuals  were  to  deny  membership,  there  would  be  insufficient \nstatistical confidence in the number of total members in the list being at least 500. \n\n(e)  On  8  October  2021,  using  the  randomising  functionality  in  Microsoft  Excel,  AEC  staff \nidentified a sample size of 88 individuals from the 539 names in list. Individuals from this \n\nAustralian Electoral Commission Meeting | Agenda Item 2 \n\nPage 11 \n\nOut of sOut of scope\n\n\n--- Page 13 ---\n\nItem 2: Review of the delegate\u2019s decision to deregister the Seniors United Party of Australia \n\nsample were contacted between 15 October 2021 and 19 October 2021 and asked if they \nwere current members of the Party [Attachment ZX].

In  accordance  with  the  ABS  testing  methodology,  one  denial  out  of  44  responses  provides \nstatistical  confidence  that  the  Party\u2019s  September  2021  list  has  at  least  500  members \n[Attachment ZY]. \n\n8.20. Based on the membership testing of the September 2021 List, despite the consideration above \nof the applicant\u2019s reasons for making an internal review application, the AEC is of the view that it \nis open to the Electoral Commission: \n\n(a)  not to be satisfied on reasonable grounds that the Party has ceased to have 500 members; \n\nand \n\n(b) \n\nto set aside the decision of the delegate of 9 March 2021 to deregister the Party under       \ns 137(6), and substitute a decision to re-register the Party.  \n\nAustralian Electoral Commission Meeting | Agenda Item 2 \n\nPage 12\n\n\n--- Page 14 ---\n\nItem 2: Review of the delegate\u2019s decision to deregister the Seniors United Party of Australia \n\n9.

\n\nthe SENIORS UNITED PARTY OF AUSTRALIA \n\nunder s 141(2) of the Electoral Act \n\nDear Mr Rogers, \n\nMy name is \nand dissatisfied with, the decision by the Australian Electoral Commission to

I am a person affected by, \n\nconsider the reasons below which I feel give a strong argument for the AEC to set aside the decision \nunder review and make a decision in substitution for the decision set aside. That is, to reregister the \nparty. \n\n I ask you to please \n\nThe reasons I feel the AEC should consider are:- \n\nDEMOGRAPHIC  REASONS \n\nBecause of the demographic which the party attempts to represent, that is over 60 years of age, our \nmainly elderly membership suffers a higher than normal attrition rate to other political parties. \n\nSUPA\u2019s high loss of members is due to:- \n\n1.   A much higher death rate than in other political parties, as well as long lasting terminal \n      health issues of members that would stop the aged from participating as a member. \n\n2.   A much higher rate of dementia, or loss of memory, which prevents members recalling that \n      they are members when the AEC calls. This would be a considerable cause for members to \n      answer negatively to membership questions by the AEC representative. ( \n\nOut of scopeOut of scopeOut of scopeOut of scopeOut of scopeOut of scope\n\n\n--- Page 3 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 4 ---\n\nunderstand, of its fear of losing the approximately $1million dollars it receives from the NSW State \ngovernment. Then we have the National Seniors which appears to have agreements with \ncommercial interests. Possibly the best is the Council for the Ageing (COTA) which appears to be \nthe best, but is getting little recognition from the press. \n\nNow it has been suggested there are ten lobbyists for every  parliamentarian in Federal parliament. \nLobbyists that are paid huge amounts and which have huge amounts to advertise to influence public \nopinion in their favour, which can oppose the needs of the elderly, or place the needs of the elderly \nsecondary to making profits. \n\nSUPA is needed to help the Federal government continually see that the requirements of the Aged \nare not being met, and advise the Federal government without a conflict of interest. \n\nREQUEST \n\nConsidering the reasons I have given, including the far higher natural attrition rate of our elderly \nmembers, which the vast majority are, their greater chance of lose of memory, and there \nunwillingness to answer \u201cyes \u201cto questions by strangers  over the phone,   and also the fact that \nSUPA alone represents such a large demographic in Australia\u2019s population, I respectfully ask the \nAEC to please consider these reasons and set aside the failed decision and substitute it with a \npass decision. \n\nThanking you for this review. \n\nADDENDUM \n\nI would suggest that under the present test for registration any party representing the Aged with \nmembers mainly in that demographic would more than likely fail the registration test. I believe even \nmajor political parties could possibly fail the test. \n\nYours Faithfully, \n\nOut of scope"}, {"type": "pdf", "output_file_path": "/downloaded_originals/Document No 5.pdf", "content_files": [], "extracted_text_path": "/extracted_texts/LEX3177_Document No 5.txt", "ai_summaries": {"balanced": {"needs_summary": true, "source_hash": "5df4ecc7c2e5dfcf70cee89aace6174cab38e399e2ef035de1732d0ef8ae7c1a"}, "left_leaning": {"needs_summary": true, "source_hash": "5df4ecc7c2e5dfcf70cee89aace6174cab38e399e2ef035de1732d0ef8ae7c1a"}, "right_leaning": {"needs_summary": true, "source_hash": "5df4ecc7c2e5dfcf70cee89aace6174cab38e399e2ef035de1732d0ef8ae7c1a"}, "government_skeptic": {"needs_summary": true, "source_hash": "5df4ecc7c2e5dfcf70cee89aace6174cab38e399e2ef035de1732d0ef8ae7c1a"}, "government_apologist": {"needs_summary": true, "source_hash": "5df4ecc7c2e5dfcf70cee89aace6174cab38e399e2ef035de1732d0ef8ae7c1a"}, "highly_critical": {"needs_summary": true, "source_hash": "5df4ecc7c2e5dfcf70cee89aace6174cab38e399e2ef035de1732d0ef8ae7c1a"}}, "filename": "Document No 5.pdf", "download_path": "/foi_assets/LEX3177/Document No 5.pdf", "extracted_text": "\n\n--- Page 1 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 2 ---\n\n25th March 2021 \n\nCommission Secretariat \nAustralian Electoral Commissioner, \nLocked Bag 4007, \nCANBERRA \nACT 2601 \ncommission.secretariat@aec.gov.au \nAEC 02 6271 4552 \n\nRequest to provide further material in support of reasons  already supplied for \nmaking an Application for Internal Review \n\n of decision to Deregister \n\nthe SENIORS UNITED PARTY OF AUSTRALIA \n\nunder s 141(2) of the Electoral Act \n\nDear Sir / Madam, \n\nI have given the following details in my Application for a Review which has already been received \nby the Australian Electoral Commission. \n\n and I am the applicant for this review. I am a person affected   \nMy name is \nby, and dissatisfied with, the decision by the Australian Electoral Commission to deregister the \n Seniors United Party of Australia, ( SUPA).  \n\nconsider the reasons below which I feel give a strong argument for the AEC to set aside the \ndecision under review and make a decision in substitution for the decision set aside. That is, to \n reregister the party. \n\n I ask you to please \n\nThe two reasons I wish to add for the AEC to consider are:- \n\nOTHER DEMOGRAPHIC  REASONS \n\nBecause of the demographic which the party attempts to represent, that is over 60 years of age, our \nmainly elderly membership is largely made up of aged pensioners, or part pensions. \n\n4.  Being a pensioner, or part pensioner usually implies that you pay no income tax. Paying no \n      income tax means that any donation given to the Seniors United party by party members \n      who are pensioners can not be claimed on income tax because they have no income tax to \n\nOut of scopeOut of scopeOut of scopeOut of scope\n\n\n--- Page 3 ---\n\npay. The result of this is that the party\u2019s income from donations is sharply reduced compared to \n     most, if not every other political party  (There is no other funding besides donations).

Main Purpose of the FOI Request\n\nThe FOI request (LEX3177) sought \"all supporting documents behind the commission's conclusion that 'the [AEC's membership testing] methodology was appropriate for membership testing, including because it was rational, fair and practical in all the circumstances'\" as stated in a previous determination (LEX967). Specifically, it requested documents supporting the claims of rationality and fairness.\n\n#### 2. Documents from the FOI Request\n\nThe primary document released is the **\"Commission Paper \u2013 Review of the delegate\u2019s decision to deregister the Senior United Party of Australia\"** dated 17 November 2021. This paper incorporates and references several attachments, including:\n\n*   **Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) Testing Methodology Tables (November 2016):** These tables outline the statistical sampling framework for membership testing based on the number of members lodged and the maximum permissible denials. (Attachments L, ZW)\n*   **Advice provided to the Commission in relation to Party registration (20 March 2017):** This document confirms the Electoral Commission's re-endorsement of the ABS methodology. (Attachment B)\n*   **Application for review and further submission by the party officer (21 & 25 March 2021):** These detail the Seniors United Party of Australia's (SUPA) reasons for challenging the deregistration decision. (Attachments N, P)\n*   **Records of Membership Testing Outcomes (various dates):**\n    *   October 2020 List testing outcomes (Attachment I)\n    *   February 2021 List testing outcomes (Attachment M)\n    *   September 2021 List testing outcomes, including identification of duplicates and cross-party members (Attachment ZV), contact records (Attachment ZX), and a breakdown of membership numbers (Attachment ZY).\n\n#### 3. Main Content Related to the FOI Request\n\nThe released documents directly address the \"appropriateness, rationality, fairness, and practicality\" of the AEC's membership testing methodology through the review of the Seniors United Party of Australia's (SUPA) deregistration.\n\n**AEC's Methodology and its Application:**\n\n*   **Foundation:** The Commission Paper (Para 3.14) states that the AEC's membership testing methodology, for lists of 500 individuals, was developed by the **Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS)** in 2010 (with updates in 2011 and 2017) and re-endorsed by the Electoral Commission in 2017. This endorsement and the ABS origin are presented as foundational to its rationality and appropriateness.\n*   **Testing Rounds:**\n    *   **October 2020 List:** An initial test of SUPA's list of 525 claimed members required a random sample of 37 individuals, allowing for a maximum of 3 denials. The test resulted in 8 denials, leading to a determination of insufficient members (Para 5.1-5.2).\n    *   **February 2021 List:** A second test of SUPA's list of 539 claimed members (after initial deregistration notice) required a sample of 44 individuals, allowing for a maximum of 5 denials. This test resulted in 9 denials, reinforcing the deregistration decision (Para 6.2-6.3).\n    *   **September 2021 List (during review):** During the internal review, a new list of 538 eligible members was tested. This required a sample of 44 individuals, with a maximum of 5 denials permitted. This test resulted in only **1 denial** (Para 8.18-8.19), which provided statistical confidence that the party had at least 500 members.\n\n**Addressing Claims of Unfairness/Impracticality:**\n\nThe SUPA party officer, in their application for review, raised concerns about the fairness and practicality of the methodology for an elderly demographic, citing:\n*   Higher death rates and health issues.\n*   Dementia/memory loss leading to negative responses.\n*   Fear of phone scammers causing refusal to answer or negative responses.\n*   Alleged AEC errors in identifying duplicates/deceased members.\n*   Lack of scrutineers during testing (unlike election polling).\n*   The party's unique demographic representation and financial disadvantages.\n\nThe Commission Paper responds to these points (Para 8.12-8.17):\n*   It states that the methodology requires formal acknowledgment of membership and does not consider individual motivations or reasons for denials.\n*   It clarifies that deceased and duplicate members are removed from the list *before* sampling, not counted as negative responses, which can be beneficial to parties by reducing the required sample size for eligible members. It confirms internal review found no errors in duplicate/deceased identification.\n*   It affirms that the Electoral Act does not provide for scrutineers in membership testing.\n*   It asserts that factors such as a party's policies, demographics, or financial situation are *not relevant* to the statutory 500-member requirement and that the AEC applies the same, consistent test across all parties to maintain political neutrality.\n\n**Conclusion of the Review:**\n\nDespite the initial deregistration and the party officer's arguments, the successful outcome of the **September 2021 membership test** (1 denial out of 44 responses) demonstrated that SUPA *did* meet the 500-member threshold according to the established ABS methodology. This led the Electoral Commission to recommend setting aside the delegate's deregistration decision and substituting it with a decision to **maintain the registration of the Seniors United Party of Australia** (Para 8.20, 9.1). This final outcome suggests that the methodology, despite initial failures by the party, was ultimately capable of affirming membership when the threshold was met.", "model": "gemini-2.5-flash", "generated_at": "2025-06-22T13:48:37.454554", "source_hash": "aefde5e6a603cc56452f1fae07626fcd5e7f768bd7bef2eb41544877c4d4efc6", "raw_response_path": "data/llm_responses/LEX3177__overall__balanced__20250622T134837.json", "output_tokens": 1308, "prompt_tokens": 16056, "total_tokens": 20194, "summary_length": 5812}, "short_index": {"text": "This FOI request (LEX3177) sought documents supporting the Australian Electoral Commission's (AEC) conclusion that its membership testing methodology was \"rational, fair and practical.\" The primary released document, the \"Commission Paper \u2013 Review of the delegate\u2019s decision to deregister the Senior United Party of Australia\" (17 Nov 2021), details the AEC's methodology, developed by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) and re-endorsed in 2017, as the foundation for its appropriateness.

From a left-leaning perspective, these documents reveal several points concerning social justice, wealth distribution, corporate influence, and civil liberties, highlighting instances where government actions or policies either align with or deviate from progressive values.\n\n**Social Justice and Representation:**\nThe core of the issue revolves around SUPA, a party explicitly established to represent \"mainly elderly members\" and \"pensioners or part-pensioners\" (p. 2, 3 of applicant's submission). The applicant argued that the AEC\u2019s standard membership testing methodology, while ostensibly neutral, disproportionately disadvantaged this demographic. Reasons cited include:\n*   **Higher Attrition and Health Issues:** An acknowledged higher death rate, terminal health issues, and a \"much higher rate of dementia, or loss of memory,\" leading members to deny or be unable to confirm membership during AEC calls (p. 10). This highlights how standardized bureaucratic processes can fail to accommodate the realities and vulnerabilities of specific social groups.\n*   **Trust and Safety Concerns:** Elderly members' heightened concern about \"phone scammers\" meant they were \"much more likely to respond with a 'No' to any question put to them over a phone\" or avoid answering calls from unknown numbers (p. 10). This underscores a systemic barrier to participation for a vulnerable group, an issue not adequately addressed by the AEC's rigid adherence to its methodology.\n*   **Procedural Fairness:** The applicant claimed \"procedural unfairness\" because political parties are not allowed scrutineers during membership testing, unlike on polling day (p. 11). This lack of transparency or independent oversight in a critical process for a party's existence deviates from progressive values of open and accountable governance.\nThe AEC's response dismissed these concerns as \"not relevant to the issue of whether the Party has ceased to have 500 members\" and asserted that it would \"not be appropriate for the Electoral Commission... to apply different membership tests to different parties\" (p. 12). While upholding formal equality, this position ignores the principle of substantive equality, where different circumstances may require different approaches to ensure equitable participation for all groups.\n\n**Wealth Distribution and Corporate Influence:**\nThe documents indirectly shed light on the significant financial disadvantages faced by smaller, niche parties, contrasting sharply with the influence of wealth in politics:\n*   **Funding Disparity:** SUPA's applicant stated that, as its members are predominantly pensioners, the party's \"income from donations is sharply reduced\" because members often have no income tax to claim deductions against (p. 3 of applicant's submission). This lack of tax-deductible donations, compared to major parties, results in \"little to no funds for communicating by mail... let alone advertising\" or employing staff. This vividly illustrates how existing wealth distribution patterns are embedded within political finance laws, favoring parties with wealthier donor bases and making it harder for parties representing lower-income demographics to compete on an equal footing.\n*   **Lobbying Power:** The applicant explicitly contrasted SUPA's financial struggles with the existence of \"ten lobbyists for every parliamentarian in Federal parliament... paid huge amounts and which have huge amounts to advertise to influence public opinion\" (p. 4 of applicant's submission). This highlights the pervasive corporate and wealthy influence in politics, dwarfing the capacity of citizen-led, grassroots movements or parties representing less financially powerful segments of society. This imbalance of power fundamentally undermines democratic ideals of equal political voice.\n\n**Civil Liberties (Participation):**\nWhile not directly a civil liberties breach, the practical barriers faced by elderly members due to fears of \"phone scammers\" (p. 10) indirectly impacts their civil liberty to associate and participate in a political party without undue burden or fear. The government's process, in this context, inadvertently creates a hurdle for a specific demographic's political engagement.\n\n**Government Actions and Policy Deviation:**\n*   **Increased Membership Threshold:** The documents mention that the *Electoral Legislation Amendment (Party Registration Integrity) Act 2021* increased the membership threshold for non-Parliamentary parties from 500 to 1,500 members, taking effect after the period under review (p. 3). From a progressive viewpoint, this increase significantly raises the barrier to entry for new and smaller parties, further entrenching the power of established political entities and potentially stifling political diversity and the representation of minority interests. This policy directly deviates from values promoting broad democratic participation and diverse political expression.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nUltimately, the AEC recommended re-registering SUPA based on a *third* membership list that successfully passed the test (p. 12). While this outcome demonstrates some flexibility in allowing a party to present new evidence, the process itself, and the AEC's initial dismissal of the specific social justice arguments related to the elderly demographic, raise concerns. The documents reveal how ostensibly neutral bureaucratic processes and legislative changes (like increased membership thresholds) can create systemic disadvantages for parties representing vulnerable or less wealthy segments of society, reinforcing existing power imbalances and undermining progressive goals of equitable participation and diverse representation in democracy.", "model": "gemini-2.5-flash", "generated_at": "2025-06-22T13:49:00.312570", "source_hash": "aefde5e6a603cc56452f1fae07626fcd5e7f768bd7bef2eb41544877c4d4efc6", "raw_response_path": "data/llm_responses/LEX3177__overall__left_leaning__20250622T134900.json", "output_tokens": 1090, "prompt_tokens": 16047, "total_tokens": 18599, "summary_length": 5895}, "short_index": {"text": "The FOI documents on the Australian Electoral Commission's (AEC) review of the Seniors United Party of Australia's (SUPA) deregistration reveal how ostensibly neutral bureaucratic processes can entrench systemic disadvantages for vulnerable groups and smaller parties, undermining progressive values of social justice and equitable political participation. The AEC's rigid membership verification methods disproportionately disadvantaged SUPA's elderly, often unwell or scam-wary, pensioner base, demonstrating a failure to accommodate substantive equality where formal equality creates barriers to genuine engagement. Furthermore, the documents indirectly expose the profound impact of wealth distribution on political influence, where SUPA's limited access to tax-deductible donations contrasts sharply with the pervasive power of corporate lobbyists, stifling the voices of less affluent demographics. The subsequent increase in the membership threshold for non-parliamentary parties also exemplifies how legislative changes can further centralise political power, making it harder for diverse, grassroots movements to gain representation and reinforcing existing power imbalances within the democratic system.", "model": "gemini-2.5-flash", "generated_at": "2025-06-22T13:49:06.140279", "source_hash": "aefde5e6a603cc56452f1fae07626fcd5e7f768bd7bef2eb41544877c4d4efc6", "raw_response_path": "data/llm_responses/LEX3177__short_index__left_leaning__20250622T134906.json", "output_tokens": 200, "prompt_tokens": 1139, "total_tokens": 1830, "summary_length": 1213}}, "right_leaning": {"overall": {"text": "The provided FOI documents detail the Australian Electoral Commission's (AEC) process for reviewing the Seniors United Party of Australia's (SUPA) registration, specifically its compliance with the statutory 500-member threshold. This review, driven by a Freedom of Information request seeking insights into the AEC's \"rational, fair, and practical\" methodology, offers a glimpse into government oversight of political entities.\n\n**Economic Efficiency:** The documents reveal a highly process-driven and resource-intensive approach to verifying party membership. The AEC utilized an Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) statistical sampling methodology, involving multiple rounds of membership list submissions (October 2020, February 2021, September 2021), automated and manual checks against the electoral roll, and direct phone contact with sampled individuals. While the use of statistical methods aims for a level of efficiency over auditing every member, the repeated testing, extensions granted due to COVID-19 lockdowns, and the extensive internal review process, including an appeal by the party officer, suggest a significant expenditure of public resources. This complex and protracted verification process raises questions about whether a more streamlined, less burdensome method could achieve similar electoral integrity goals with greater economic efficiency.\n\n**Individual Liberty:** The requirement for a political party to maintain a minimum number of members, subject to government verification through direct contact with individuals, presents a tension with individual liberty and freedom of association. While the intent is to ensure legitimate public support for registered parties and prevent fraudulent registrations, the state's granular oversight into a voluntary association's internal affairs (its membership list) and direct questioning of citizens about their affiliations can be seen as intrusive. The party officer's concerns about elderly members' reluctance to confirm membership due to privacy fears, memory issues, or distrust of phone scammers highlight how a standardized government methodology might inadvertently impinge on the exercise of individual political affiliation or privacy.\n\n**National Security:** These documents do not directly address issues related to national security. The AEC's role primarily pertains to the integrity and administration of electoral processes within Australia, rather than safeguarding against foreign threats or other national security concerns.\n\n**Fiscal Responsibility:** The detailed and iterative nature of the membership verification process, as outlined, demands considerable taxpayer resources. Each submission of a membership list triggers a complex sequence of data processing, manual checks, and a large volume of phone calls. The fact that the party was deregistered, appealed, and then had to submit a third list for re-testing, all while the AEC processed extensions and reviewed detailed arguments, indicates substantial administrative costs. A fiscally responsible government would continually scrutinize such processes to ensure they deliver essential public value commensurate with their expense, particularly for maintaining a basic numerical threshold for political parties.\n\n**Limited Government:** The documents illustrate the considerable power of a government agency (the AEC) to regulate and, if deemed non-compliant, deregister political parties. The setting of a membership threshold (which was subsequently increased from 500 to 1,500 members by legislation, although the 500-member rule applied here) and the unilateral application of a specific, non-negotiable testing methodology, reflect a significant degree of government control over the political landscape. The AEC's dismissal of the party's arguments regarding demographic challenges, lack of scrutineer rights during testing, and financial disadvantages underscores a rigid adherence to statutory requirements, rather than discretionary accommodation. While a limited government must ensure fair and orderly elections, the extent of bureaucratic oversight in determining the legitimacy of political associations can be perceived as an overreach, potentially hindering the emergence or sustainability of grassroots or niche political movements, and thus limiting the free association of citizens in the political sphere.\n\nIn summary, the documents reveal a rigorous, albeit resource-intensive, government process for ensuring electoral integrity. From a right-leaning perspective, while the principle of verifying party legitimacy aligns with fiscal responsibility (preventing misuse of public resources by non-existent entities) and ensuring a sound electoral framework, the extent of bureaucratic engagement, the potential for administrative inefficiency, and the intrusive nature of membership verification raise concerns regarding economic efficiency, individual liberty, and the scope of government in regulating political association.

Despite a specific FOI request for documentation supporting the methodology's \"rational, fair and practical\" nature, the provided papers largely describe its application, not its foundational justification, suggesting a lack of transparency.\n\nThe Seniors United Party of Australia (SUPA), representing an elderly demographic, faced deregistration after two membership list tests failed to meet the 500-member threshold. The AEC's statistical testing methodology, a \"random sample\" phone survey, yielded \"too many denials\" (8/37 and 9/44, respectively) to provide \"statistical confidence.\"\n\nSUPA's application for review highlighted critical demographic challenges: a higher death rate, health issues, prevalent dementia or memory loss among members leading to negative responses, and an understandable fear of phone scammers influencing engagement. The party also noted its severe funding disadvantages, limiting its ability to communicate with members or employ staff, and the lack of scrutineer access during AEC membership testing, a right afforded during elections.\n\nThe AEC's response to these concerns epitomizes bureaucratic inflexibility and a narrow interpretation of rules:\n*   The claims of age-related issues (dementia, scam fears) were dismissed due to a lack of \"evidence\" from the applicant and deemed irrelevant to \"positive or negative response rates.\" This ignores real-world sociological factors and places an undue burden of proof on the party to validate systemic issues.\n*   The AEC explicitly stated that the Electoral Act \"does not provide political parties with any equivalent right of scrutiny\" for membership testing, dismissing a legitimate fairness concern as a mere statutory absence.\n*   The AEC maintained it had \"no discretion\" and could not consider \"policies or demographics\" of a party, insisting on a one-size-fits-all approach that arguably disadvantages niche or demographically specific parties.\n\nRemarkably, after two failed attempts and the outright dismissal of the party's contextual arguments, the AEC allowed a *third* membership list submission. This final test, using the identical \"ABS testing methodology,\" yielded only one denial out of 44 responses, now providing \"statistical confidence\" for the party to be re-registered. This abrupt reversal, following persistent (and largely dismissed) appeals, raises significant questions:\n*   **Waste and Inefficiency:** The process involved multiple rounds of testing, submissions, and internal reviews, consuming significant AEC and party resources, only to result in a re-registration based on a marginal statistical shift.\n*   **Questionable Decision-Making:** The stark difference in outcomes between tests, all using the same \"rational\" methodology, suggests either an inherent inconsistency in the test's reliability or an implicit pressure to eventually find a passing result after extensive administrative effort. It undermines the asserted precision and fairness of the \"statistical confidence\" model.\n*   **Power Abuse/Lack of Accountability:** The AEC's rigid dismissal of the party's unique demographic challenges and fairness arguments, only to ultimately reverse its decision on statistical grounds, indicates a system prioritizing procedural adherence over contextual understanding or adaptive policy, with little apparent accountability for the initial, costly failures.\n\nIn essence, the documents portray an electoral commission that, while adhering to its internal processes, struggles with a critical application of \"fairness\" in diverse contexts, preferring a rigid, statistical model that can lead to inefficient, drawn-out disputes and ultimately, seemingly arbitrary outcomes.", "model": "gemini-2.5-flash", "generated_at": "2025-06-22T13:49:50.091925", "source_hash": "aefde5e6a603cc56452f1fae07626fcd5e7f768bd7bef2eb41544877c4d4efc6", "raw_response_path": "data/llm_responses/LEX3177__overall__government_skeptic__20250622T134950.json", "output_tokens": 732, "prompt_tokens": 16043, "total_tokens": 18864, "summary_length": 3968}, "short_index": {"text": "The Australian Electoral Commission's deregistration process, viewed skeptically, highlights a rigid bureaucracy that prioritizes its unproven \"ABS testing methodology\" over fairness and real-world considerations.

LEX3177, sought supporting information behind the Australian Electoral Commission's (AEC) conclusion that its membership testing methodology is \"appropriate, rational, fair, and practical.\" The released documents clearly demonstrate this by detailing the meticulous process for assessing political party registration.\n\nA core function of the AEC is ensuring that registered political parties genuinely meet the legislative membership thresholds, which were 500 members at the time of these reviews, recently increased to 1,500 to further strengthen democratic accountability. The AEC relies on a rigorous, statistically-sound methodology developed by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) for this purpose, a testament to its commitment to evidence-based and objective decision-making.\n\nInitially, the Seniors United Party of Australia faced deregistration after two separate membership list submissions (October 2020 and February 2021) failed to meet the required statistical confidence levels under the ABS testing methodology. This demonstrates the AEC's diligence in applying consistent standards to all parties, ensuring that only those with a verifiable membership base remain registered, which is vital for public confidence in the electoral process.\n\nHowever, the documents also reveal the AEC's commitment to fairness and flexibility. Following the initial deregistration decision, the party exercised its right to an internal review under Section 141 of the Commonwealth Electoral Act. The AEC exhibited significant support and adaptability during this period, granting multiple extensions to the party to submit an updated membership list, acknowledging the challenges posed by the COVID-19 lockdowns in Greater Sydney. This proactive engagement underscores the government's dedication to assisting parties in meeting their obligations.\n\nCrucially, the review process allowed for the consideration of the latest available evidence, consistent with established legal precedents. Upon testing the party's September 2021 membership list, the AEC's robust methodology confirmed that the party *did* now meet the required 500-member threshold. This positive outcome, where only one denial was recorded from a sample of 44 individuals, ultimately led the Electoral Commission to set aside the delegate's initial decision and recommend the re-registration of the party.\n\nIn conclusion, these documents showcase a government agency that operates with meticulous care, transparency, and a deep commitment to fairness.

The entire process appears designed to entrap smaller parties, particularly those representing vulnerable demographics, rather than genuinely verify their legitimacy.\n\n**Arbitrary and Prejudiced Methodology:**\nThe AEC's reliance on a \"rational, fair and practical\" ABS testing methodology is demonstrably false and deeply prejudicial. This 2010 methodology, \"re-endorsed\" in 2017 without apparent critical review, rigidly dictates sample sizes and a minuscule number of \"permitted denials.\" For a party representing the elderly, this statistical model becomes a tool of disenfranchisement. The AEC callously dismissed SUPA's valid concerns that elderly members face higher rates of death, non-participation due to health issues, memory loss (dementia), and a justifiable fear of phone scammers. The AEC's robotic assertion that these factors \"would not seem to have any bearing on positive or negative response rates\" or that there is \"no evidence\" for such claims, is a shocking refusal to engage with lived reality. This isn't \"political neutrality\"; it's a dogmatic application of a flawed process that disproportionately penalizes parties for the genuine challenges of their demographic.\n\n**Active Obstruction and Lack of Transparency:**\nThe AEC's actions are not merely incompetent but actively obstructive. While the AEC possesses direct access to the Commonwealth Electoral Roll to identify non-enrolled, deceased, or duplicate members, it *failed* to proactively provide this crucial information to SUPA in a timely manner. Instead, the AEC used its privileged access to identify these errors, then rejected the lists. The party officer's valiant, but ultimately incomplete, efforts to purge the lists highlight the AEC's deliberate withholding of actionable data. Most egregiously, the AEC **denied** SUPA's repeated requests for access to its Electoral Information Access System (ELIAS) during the COVID-19 lockdown, forcing the party to operate blind while simultaneously penalizing it for inaccuracies the AEC *alone* could easily identify and assist with. This is not oversight; it is an active denial of the tools necessary for compliance, designed to ensure failure. The refusal to allow scrutineers during membership testing, claiming no \"statutory right,\" further entrenches a culture of opaque decision-making, allowing the AEC to operate unchecked.\n\n**Unnecessary Harassment and Discretionary Abuse:**\nSUPA was put through an arduous and protracted deregistration process involving three separate membership list submissions and multiple extensions, largely due to the AEC's rigid adherence to its flawed process and its own internal delays (e.g., the Groom by-election suspension). The fact that SUPA's *third* list ultimately *passed* the test (with only one denial out of 44, well within the permitted five) reveals the absurdity and futility of the prior deregistration attempts. This suggests the party always had the requisite members, but was repeatedly failed by a discriminatory and inflexible testing regime. The AEC's \"no discretion\" policy under s 137(6)(a) \u2013 forcing deregistration if \"satisfied on reasonable grounds\" \u2013 combined with its skewed testing, ensures that its \"reasonable grounds\" are built on an inherently unreasonable foundation.\n\n**Underlying Malice and Political Targeting:**\nThe lurking shadow of the \"Electoral Legislation Amendment (Party Registration Integrity) Act 2021,\" which increased the membership threshold from 500 to 1,500, suggests a more sinister motive. The AEC's intense scrutiny and aggressive pursuit of deregistration for SUPA at the *500-member* level, just months before the higher threshold came into effect, can be interpreted as a calculated effort to clear the registry of smaller, less financially powerful parties before they would face an even more insurmountable hurdle. The document itself admits the party's disadvantaged financial position due to its pensioner membership and lack of tax-deductible donations \u2013 factors the AEC hypocritically deems \"not relevant\" to its \"neutral\" assessment. This reveals a chilling disregard for the democratic principle of diverse representation, preferring to maintain a registry of parties that can easily navigate its arbitrary and punitive hurdles.\n\nIn summary, the AEC's conduct in this case is a damning indictment of its bureaucratic inflexibility, its stunning lack of empathy, and its willingness to use a biased \"neutral\" methodology to effectively eliminate a political voice, all while hiding behind the letter of the law and denying fundamental fairness. The ultimate re-registration of SUPA only underscores the unnecessary hardship and potential injustice it endured due to a process ripe for abuse.", "model": "gemini-2.5-flash", "generated_at": "2025-06-22T13:50:39.083710", "source_hash": "aefde5e6a603cc56452f1fae07626fcd5e7f768bd7bef2eb41544877c4d4efc6", "raw_response_path": "data/llm_responses/LEX3177__overall__highly_critical__20250622T135039.json", "output_tokens": 979, "prompt_tokens": 16044, "total_tokens": 19307, "summary_length": 4989}, "short_index": {"text": "The Australian Electoral Commission's (AEC) relentless campaign to deregister the Seniors United Party of Australia (SUPA) exposes a shockingly cynical display of bureaucratic malfeasance, cloaked in a veneer of \"neutrality,\" designed to systematically disenfranchise smaller parties and vulnerable demographics.
