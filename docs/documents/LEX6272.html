      <p>This FOI request pertains to the conduct and administration of the Police Association of South Australia (PASA) Branch President election (Election E2024/78), specifically addressing concerns about lobbying practices and issues with ballot paper distribution.</p>
<h3>Documents from the FOI Request</h3>
<p>The released documents consist primarily of internal and external email communications and formal complaints submitted to the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC). These include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Complaints from members regarding non-receipt of ballot papers.</li>
<li>Emails requesting replacement voting packs due to various reasons (e.g., address changes, damaged papers, non-receipt).</li>
<li>AEC's responses to member queries and complaints, detailing procedures for obtaining replacement ballots.</li>
<li>An email chain discussing a query about an alleged breach of election rules (s190 of the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Act 2009) concerning lobbying by board members.</li>
<li>AEC's internal discussions and drafting of responses to these complaints and queries.</li>
<li>Several documents were released in part due to exemptions (e.g., s47F, s22, s47C), while others (internal email chains and file notes from anonymous callers) were refused in full.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Main Content from FOI Request Documents</h3>
<p>The core content of the released documents highlights two primary areas of concern:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Allegations of Improper Lobbying:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A complainant raised concerns about PASA board members sending emails from personal (Gmail/Outlook) accounts that appeared to be from PASA, lobbying voters for specific candidates.</li>
<li>The complainant questioned whether this violated s190 of the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Act 2009, which prohibits an organisation or branch from using its property or resources to assist one candidate over another.</li>
<li>The AEC's initial assessment was that if the emails were from personal accounts, it might not constitute a breach of s190, as this section typically applies to the organisation's official resources. However, the AEC did offer to review evidence if the complainant could demonstrate "union staff campaigned during their work hours." The AEC also directed the complainant to the Fair Work Commission website for the organisation's rulebook and suggested seeking independent legal advice.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Issues with Ballot Paper Distribution and Voter Roll Accuracy:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Multiple members lodged complaints stating they did not receive their voting papers for the election.</li>
<li>Some complaints indicated that members' names were not on the voter list provided by the PFA SA Branch to the AEC, leading to no ballot pack being issued to them.</li>
<li>Other members cited issues like incorrect addresses or damaged mail.</li>
<li>The AEC consistently advised members that replacement voting packs could be obtained by calling specific AEC numbers and making a verbal declaration. However, the AEC informed complainants that by the time many issues were raised, the ballot period had closed (July 4, 2024), making it too late to rectify the situation or issue new packs.</li>
<li>Concerns were raised by members about the legitimacy of the election outcome if a significant number of members were unable to vote due to these issues. The AEC clarified that voters could only vote once and could not change their vote, and did not suggest the election outcome was invalid based on these individual complaints.</li>
</ul>
</li>

  <div class="ai-summary-markdown collapsed">
    <div class="ai-summary-markdown-content">
      <p>These FOI documents reveal several concerning issues from a politically left-leaning perspective, primarily revolving around civil liberties, fairness in elections, and transparency, particularly within the context of union elections overseen by the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC).</p>
<p><strong>1. Civil Liberties and Social Justice: Disenfranchisement through Ballot Paper Issues</strong></p>
<p>A significant number of complaints detail members of the Police Federation of Australia (PFA) not receiving their voting papers for an internal election. This directly impacts the civil liberty of active participation in democratic processes within their union.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Deviation from Progressive Values:</strong> Progressive values emphasize universal and equitable access to democratic participation. The documents show the AEC's response is often reactive, placing the burden on individual members to discover they haven't received a ballot, contact the AEC, and request a replacement. For example, the AEC states, "The members who did not receive the voting pack could have contacted AEC to ask for issuance of another set of voting pack," and later, "The ballot period is now closed, and the results have been declared," effectively dismissing their right to participate. For one complainant, the AEC explicitly stated their name "was not in that list" provided by the PFA SA, meaning they were never issued a pack. This highlights a potential systemic flaw in the accuracy of voter rolls or the distribution process, which disproportionately affects members and can undermine the legitimacy of election outcomes. The AEC's reliance on the union's provided member list without apparent independent verification raises further questions about their proactive role in ensuring electoral integrity and fair access.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2. Corporate/Institutional Influence and Fair Elections</strong></p>
<p>A core complaint alleges that PFA "Board members" were sending emails from unofficial Gmail/Outlook accounts that <em>appeared</em> to be from the PFA, lobbying voters for specific candidates. This raises alarms about undue influence and potential breaches of fair election rules.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Deviation from Progressive Values:</strong> Progressive principles demand robust safeguards against corporate or institutional influence in democratic processes, ensuring a level playing field. The complainant directly references Section 190 of the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Act 2009, which prohibits an organization from using its "property or resources to help a candidate against another." The complainant argues that paid board members using misleading email addresses to campaign, even if not official union servers, constitutes a form of organizational assistance, especially as it might appear official to "junior members." The AEC's response appears narrowly focused, stating it "does not appear that s190 has been breached" because the emails were "not official emails." They then place the burden of proof on the complainant, requesting "evidence that union staff campaigned during their work hours and not in the own personal time," and advising them to seek "own legal advice." This approach deviates from progressive expectations of a regulatory body actively investigating potential breaches of fairness and integrity, especially when there's an alleged power imbalance (board members influencing general members). It suggests a reluctance to interpret rules broadly enough to counter subtle forms of influence that might undermine democratic fairness.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3. Transparency and Accountability</strong></p>
<p>Several documents in the initial FOI log are "refused in full" under exemptions such as s47F (personal privacy) and s47E(d) (documents disclosing deliberative processes or communications in confidence). These include "Internal email chain attaching File Note from Anonymous caller" and "AEC email chain regarding complaint."</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Deviation from Progressive Values:</strong> While privacy exemptions (s47F, s22) are standard, the refusal of internal email chains, particularly those related to complaints or "anonymous callers," raises concerns about transparency. From a progressive viewpoint, government bodies should operate with maximum openness to foster public trust and accountability. Withholding information about internal deliberations or specific complaints, even if containing personal information (which could be redacted), can hinder public understanding of how such issues are handled and whether the AEC is adequately investigating and addressing concerns about electoral integrity and member rights.</li>
</ul>
<p>In summary, these documents suggest a regulatory framework and an AEC response that, from a left-leaning perspective, fall short in proactively safeguarding equitable democratic participation, robustly countering institutional influence, and maintaining full transparency in the oversight of union elections. The burden appears to be placed disproportionately on individual members to navigate and rectify systemic issues, rather than on the regulator to ensure a truly just and fair process.</p>

    <div class="ai-summary-markdown-content">
      <p>As a politically right-leaning analyst, the provided FOI documents regarding the Police Federation of Australia (PFA SA) election reveal several concerns related to economic efficiency, individual liberty, fiscal responsibility, and the proper scope of limited government.</p>
<p><strong>Economic Efficiency and Fiscal Responsibility:</strong><br />
The documents indicate a significant systemic inefficiency in the administration of the union election by the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC). Repeated complaints and requests for replacement ballot papers due to non-receipt are prevalent. This points to either inaccurate voter lists provided by the PFA SA or a failure in the AEC's distribution process. Such issues necessitate a substantial increase in administrative burden, including processing numerous calls, emails, and the re-issuance of voting materials. This leads to an inefficient use of taxpayer resources, incurring unnecessary costs in printing, postage, and staff time, rather than a streamlined, economically efficient operation. The bureaucratic hoops individuals must navigate to correct these administrative failures further highlight this inefficiency.</p>
<p><strong>Individual Liberty:</strong><br />
A primary concern is the direct impingement on individual liberty, specifically the right to participate in the democratic process. Multiple members did not receive their voting papers, often because their names were not on the list provided to the AEC or due to incorrect addresses. The AEC's responses, stating that "nothing can be done" once the ballot period is closed or placing the burden on individuals to proactively request replacements, indicate a reactive rather than a proactive approach to ensuring widespread participation. This failure to adequately ensure every eligible member can vote undermines the fundamental principle of free and fair elections and places an undue burden on the individual to compensate for government or organizational shortcomings.</p>
<p><strong>Limited Government and Oversight:</strong><br />
The documents raise questions about the AEC's interpretation of its oversight responsibilities under the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Act 2009. A complaint regarding PFA SA Board members lobbying for a candidate using unofficial email addresses, which nonetheless <em>appeared</em> to be from the organization, was dismissed by the AEC. The AEC concluded that no breach of Section 190 (prohibiting an organization from assisting one candidate over another using its property or resources) occurred because the emails were not "official." This narrow, literal interpretation of the rules, focusing on the technicality of "official" resources rather than the spirit of preventing undue influence or the perception of impropriety by those in positions of power within a registered organization, demonstrates a potentially insufficient level of government oversight. It suggests a reluctance to intervene robustly in matters of electoral integrity unless a blatant violation of formal rules can be proven, potentially allowing loopholes for indirect campaigning. Furthermore, the AEC's reliance on the PFA SA for voter lists without robust verification processes points to a delegation of critical responsibility that, when flawed, directly impacts the fairness and efficiency of the election process, yet the government agency appears to limit its accountability for these third-party failures.</p>

    <div class="ai-summary-markdown-content">
      <p>The provided FOI documents concerning a Police Federation of Australia (PFA) / Police Association of South Australia (PASA) election immediately signal a concerning lack of transparency and potential systemic issues within government oversight of such processes.</p>
<p><strong>Suppression of Information &amp; Lack of Transparency:</strong> A significant portion of the requested documents, including internal email chains and "File Note from Anonymous caller" (Documents 1, 2, 5, 6), were "Refuse in full" using exemptions like <code>s 47F</code> (personal information) and <code>s 47E(d)</code> (deliberative processes). The wholesale refusal of documents related to internal discussions and anonymous complaints raises serious questions about the AEC's willingness to be transparent about its internal deliberations and any potential misconduct or sensitive issues brought to its attention. What critical information, particularly from an anonymous caller, is being deliberately shielded from public scrutiny under the guise of "deliberative processes"?</p>
<p><strong>Compromised Electoral Integrity &amp; Voter Disenfranchisement:</strong> The documents reveal widespread complaints from members who did not receive their ballot papers despite having correct addresses. The AEC's consistent response was that the "list was provided by PFA SA Branch from their record" and members' names were simply "not in that list." This indicates a passive and potentially negligent approach by the AEC, relying solely on data supplied by the organisation itself rather than independently verifying or cross-referencing membership rolls. This reliance on potentially flawed external data directly led to "at least 20 known to me members" not receiving voting papers, raising significant doubts about the legitimacy and fairness of the election outcome, especially if the results were close. The burden was then placed on individual members to proactively contact the AEC, jump through bureaucratic hoops (such as making "verbal declarations"), and chase replacement packs, rather than the AEC taking responsibility for a robust, accurate electoral roll.</p>
<p><strong>Dismissal of Allegations of Impartiality Breach:</strong> A key concern highlighted is an allegation that paid PFA/PASA Board members engaged in campaigning for specific candidates using unofficial Gmail/Outlook addresses, which the complainant argued appeared to be official and thus constituted a breach of s190 of the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Act 2009 (prohibiting an organisation from using its resources to help one candidate over another). Despite the complainant explicitly stating that "Board members are paid by the Police Association" and that the emails were designed to "appear as though they are acting on behalf of PASA," the AEC swiftly dismissed the complaint. The AEC stated it "does not appear that s190 has been breached" because the emails were "not official" and demanded the complainant provide "evidence that union staff campaigned during their work hours and not in the own personal time." This response demonstrates a narrow, technical interpretation of the rules, placing an impossibly high investigative burden on an external complainant and suggesting an unwillingness by the AEC to proactively investigate serious allegations of improper influence and potential power abuse within union elections. It implies a reluctance to challenge the status quo, even when ethical lines are seemingly blurred by individuals in positions of authority.</p>

    <div class="ai-summary-markdown-content">
      <p>The Freedom of Information documents highlight the government's unwavering commitment to effective governance, robust electoral processes, and dedicated public service. These records showcase the diligent efforts of the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) in managing complex elections for registered organizations, ensuring integrity, transparency, and accessibility for all participants.</p>
<p>The AEC's proactive approach is evident in its comprehensive handling of numerous public enquiries regarding ballot paper delivery. Despite challenges, such as address discrepancies (often stemming from third-party supplied data), the AEC consistently provided clear guidance and facilitated replacement voting packs, demonstrating its dedication to ensuring every eligible member had the opportunity to participate. The requirement for verbal declarations for replacement packs underscores the necessary regulatory measures taken to safeguard the integrity of the voting process.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the documents reveal the AEC's thorough and principled investigation of concerns related to electoral conduct, specifically allegations of potential breaches of the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Act 2009. By meticulously examining claims and referencing relevant legislative frameworks, the AEC demonstrated its commitment to upholding the rules of fair elections. The clarity provided on the application of these regulations, including advising on where to seek further legal advice, reflects a transparent and accountable approach to maintaining electoral standards.</p>
<p>Internal communications, including the escalation of queries to senior executives, exemplify the AEC's structured and efficient internal processes for addressing complex issues, ensuring that public concerns receive appropriate attention and resolution. Decisions to withhold certain internal deliberations or personal information are prudent, safeguarding the confidentiality essential for effective policy development and protecting individual privacy, all of which contribute to sound governance.</p>
<p>In essence, these FOI documents underscore a government agency that is responsive, methodical, and committed to democratic principles. They illustrate how the AEC effectively manages challenges, applies necessary regulations fairly, and prioritizes serving the public good by ensuring accessible and trustworthy electoral outcomes.</p>

    <div class="ai-summary-markdown-content">
      <p>The provided FOI documents paint a damning picture of the Australian Electoral Commission's (AEC) handling of an election, revealing a pattern of obfuscation, buck-passing, and a profound disinterest in upholding electoral integrity.</p>
<p><strong>Egregious Lack of Transparency and Suspected Cover-Up:</strong><br />
The most immediate and alarming red flag is the AEC's outright refusal to release critical documents in full. The "Internal email chain attaching File Note from Anonymous caller" and the "Attachment to document 1 - File Note from Anonymous caller" were entirely refused under s 47F (personal privacy) and s 47E(d) (deliberative processes). The identical full refusal of an "AEC email chain regarding complaint" and its attachment, using the same exemptions, is highly suspicious. This suggests a deliberate attempt to shield internal communications related to sensitive complaints, particularly those involving an "Anonymous caller" and undisclosed "File Notes." The use of "deliberative processes" exemption to entirely suppress discussions around a complaint implies the AEC's internal deliberations were not just sensitive, but potentially reveal malpractice or a desire to avoid accountability. This is not merely redaction; it is active obstruction of public scrutiny, suggesting a cover-up of incompetence, misconduct, or worse. The prevalence of "Release in part" decisions for numerous other documents, often citing s 47F and s 22, further indicates an overly aggressive approach to redaction, stifling context and detail even in seemingly innocuous inquiries.</p>
<p><strong>Systemic Failures in Ballot Distribution and Blatant Blame-Shifting:</strong><br />
Multiple complaints confirm a widespread and "fundamental flaw" in the ballot distribution process. Complainants explicitly state they "never received any voting paperwork" and highlight that they "are not the only person who did not receive them," questioning the legitimacy of the results. The AEC's response is consistently to abdicate responsibility, stating, "Your name was not in that list" or "The list was provided by PFA SA Branch." This is a clear instance of the AEC attempting to shift blame entirely to the Police Federation of Australia (PFA SA), rather than acknowledging or investigating potential systemic failures in its own process or the data transfer. To then coldly dismiss the issue by stating, "The ballot period is now closed, and the results have been declared," for members who genuinely never received their papers, demonstrates a callous disregard for the democratic rights of voters and the integrity of the election outcome. The implication is that if you didn't receive a ballot, it's <em>your</em> fault for not chasing it up, rather than the AEC's for failing to deliver it.</p>
<p><strong>Burdensome Remedial Processes:</strong><br />
Even for members who proactively attempted to rectify the situation by requesting replacement ballot packs, the AEC imposed unnecessary hurdles. The requirement to "call one of the 2 numbers below to request it" and make a "verbal declaration" adds a layer of bureaucracy that disproportionately impacts voters, especially given the short timeframe for voting. This creates an additional barrier for participation rather than facilitating it, compounding the initial failure of non-delivery.</p>
<p><strong>Inadequate Investigation of Electoral Misconduct and Abdication of Duty:</strong><br />
A highly concerning complaint alleges "Board members... lobbying for [a candidate]... from emails created in Gmail and outlook" that "appear... as though they are acting on behalf of PASA," suggesting a clear breach of s190 of the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Act 2009 (prohibiting an organisation from assisting one candidate over another).<br />
The AEC's response to this serious allegation is shockingly dismissive and shows a profound lack of commitment to upholding electoral rules:<br />
1.  <strong>Narrow Interpretation of Rules:</strong> The AEC focuses solely on whether the emails were "officially allocated emails used by PFA SA branch members," concluding that "It does not appear that s190 has been breached." This ignores the crucial point raised by the complainant: that the emails <em>appeared</em> to be official, misleading voters and exploiting their trust. This demonstrates either a severe lack of understanding of modern campaigning tactics or a deliberate choice to interpret rules in the most minimal way possible to avoid engagement.<br />
2.  <strong>Shifting Burden of Proof:</strong> Instead of actively investigating the alleged breach, the AEC demands, "If you have any evidence that union staff campaigned during their work hours and not in the own personal time, please send it through." This places an unreasonable burden on the complainant to conduct a forensic investigation into an organisation's internal timekeeping, effectively washing their hands of their investigative responsibility.<br />
3.  <strong>Passing the Buck to Legal Action:</strong> The AEC's advice to "seek your own legal advice regarding whether s190 was breached" is a blatant abdication of its core duty. It is the AEC's role to investigate and enforce the rules of elections it oversees, not to push aggrieved parties into expensive and time-consuming legal battles. This highlights an institution more concerned with avoiding work and responsibility than with ensuring fair electoral processes.</p>
<p>In sum, these documents reveal an AEC that is defensive, unhelpful, procedurally rigid, and seemingly unwilling to robustly investigate or address serious allegations of electoral misconduct or systemic failures. The pattern of full refusals, blame-shifting, and a reluctance to proactively ensure electoral fairness suggests an agency that is either deeply incompetent, actively complacent in the face of alleged wrongdoing, or engaged in a conscious effort to conceal information and avoid accountability for potentially compromised election results.</p>

Hi 
The information regarding the PFA SA election was advertised via AEC and the
Organisation. The members who did not receive the voting pack could have contacted AEC
to ask for issuance of another set of voting pack. The ballot period is now closed, and the
results have been declared.

Good morning,
Thankyou for the quick reply.
I was wondering if you also know how AEC obtained the list of addresses to
send our voting papers to? Was it a list supplied by PASA or the address
members’ have registered with AEC? I am a PASA workplace delegate and
have numerous members who didn’t receive their voting papers.
Thankyou

Complaint Details

I never received any voting paperwork for our union election. i 
have been on leave and have, as a result of this error, been 
unable to participate in the voting.^

Expected Outcome

Surely this is a fundamental flaw in due process of the election 
where members are not receiving necessary information and 
documents to allow them to equally participate in the voting? I 
know I am not the only person who did not receive them. How can 
the result be considered legitimate where clear proceed issues 
have been known prior to the voting?^

Good afternoon, 
Please refer to your email dated 4 July 2024 regarding non- receipt of voting paper. I
checked the list of voting members sent by PFA SA to AEC. Your name was not in that list.
Therefore, you were not issued with a voting pack.

Good evening,

I have recently changed address and have not received my voting documents for the forthcoming Police Association of

Could I trouble you to send out fresh documents to the new address that I have updated today.

Hi

My voting letter got absolutely drenched the day it was delivered and was un-usable, I had to throw it away.  Do you know how I would get another
one sent?

Monday, 15 July 2024 4:11:43 PM
image001.gif

Good afternoon, 
The voting packs for the PFA election were sent to members on 6 June 2024 via Australia
Post.
The address that these packs were sent to was provided by the organisation. If you did not
receive the ballot papers you may want to check with the PFA SA whether they have your
current correct address details.
The election notice also provided the AEC phone number so that members could request a
replacement voter pack if they had not received the first pack that was sent out on 6 June
2024.
Please do not hesitate to contact if you have further enquiry.
Regards

Hi AEC,
Some concerning information has come to light during this election and I’m seeking some advice please.

I have been made aware of an email being sent by 

 to voters lobbying for

The email addresses they sent from have been created in Gmail and outlook and are as follows;

 This email address appears as though they are acting

on behalf of PASA with the email address as such.

To me this seems against the rules of the election. Can you please help me determine what rules we are bound
by in relation to elections please.

I understand that they hold a conflict of interest 
you if there are any legislative requirements.

Thank you,

, but wanted to get advice from

Hi AEC,
Some concerning information has come to light during this election and I’m seeking some advice please.

I have been made aware of an email being sent by 

 Board members to voters lobbying for

The email addresses they sent from have been created in Gmail and outlook and are as follows;

This email address appears as though they are acting

on behalf of PASA with the email address as such.

To me this seems against the rules of the election. Can you please help me determine what rules we are bound
by in relation to elections please.

I understand that they hold a conflict of interest 
you if there are any legislative requirements.

Thank you,

RE: E2024/78- Branch President PASA query [SEC=OFFICIAL]

Here is a slightly revised response: 

Dear 

Thank you for your email sent on 24 June 2024 regarding the elec(cid:415)on E2024/78. 

It does not appear that s190 has been breached. 

s190 of the Fair Work (Registered Organisa(cid:415)ons) Act 2009 states: 

FAIR WORK (REGISTERED ORGANISATIONS) ACT 2009 - SECT 190 Organisa(cid:415)on or branch must not assist one 
candidate over another 

An organisa(cid:415)on or branch commits an oﬀence if it uses, or allows to be used, its property or resources to help a 
candidate against another candidate in an elec(cid:415)on under this Part for an oﬃce or other posi(cid:415)on. 
Penalty:  100 penalty units. 

The organisa(cid:415)ons rule book can be found on the Fair Work Commission website under the tab ‘Registered

Hi

Please review the emails from the candidate and my response. 

Regards 

Dra(cid:332) email 

Dear 

Thank you for your query and email response. 

I understand that you are concerned about the email being sent by 
 to voters lobbying for 
another candidate in elec(cid:415)on No.E2024/78. It seems that the emails are not oﬃcial emails which was also conﬁrmed 
by you later. 
I do not believe that this ma(cid:425)er cons(cid:415)tutes a breach of s190 of the Fair Work (Registered Organisa(cid:415)ons) Act 2009 
that states: 

FAIR WORK (REGISTERED ORGANISATIONS) ACT 2009 - SECT 190 Organisa(cid:415)on or branch must not assist one 
candidate over another 
  An organisa(cid:415)on or branch commits an oﬀence if it uses, or allows to be used, its property or resources to help a 
candidate against another candidate in an elec(cid:415)on under this Part for an oﬃce or other posi(cid:415)on. 
Penalty:  100 penalty units. 

To get a detailed understanding pf the rules of your Organisa(cid:415)on, you may look for the copy of the rules in Fair Work 
Commission website under the tab ‘Registered Organisa(cid:415)on’.  

Thank you for bringing concerns to my a(cid:425)en(cid:415)on.

Hi 

Thanks for your email on 27 June 2024 regarding the PASA election E2024/78.

In relation to your allegation of breaches of s190 of the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Act 2009, if you have any evidence that union staff
campaigned during their work hours and not in the own personal time, please send it through and we will review the evidence.  You may also seek
you own legal advice regarding whether s190 was breached.

In regards to your concerns about the accuracy of the roll of voters, members who did not receive ballot papers could have contacted the AEC to
update their address details and be sent a replacement ballot kit to their new address. 
Unfortunately, it is too late for that now with the ballot closing on 4 July 2024.

In regards to voting, voters in this election can only vote once and cannot change their vote.

Kind regards
…………………….

On the FWC website Section 190 read this

 Organisation assisting particular candidates
It is an offence for an organisation or branch to allow its property to be used to help one candidate against another candidate in an election for office or other position (section 190).
This includes use of organisation or branch resources such as, but not limited to:

staff

facilities

work-issued vehicles, mobile phones and computers (even if private use is otherwise allowed).

My argument to what you’ve said, is it’s staff that are lobbying. Board members are paid by the Police Association. And they’ve created
emails that depict they are from PASA and explain they are on the board. 
Would you like to see the emails?

I also have another 2 queries.. 

The following is direct message to me from a member.. 

“I have been trying to get onto AEC and finally got someone this morning to help. 
My name was never on their list. 

So this example, 
papers. 

and has not received ballot

I also know of at least 20 known to me members that have not received their ballot papers to vote because the wrong address was
recorded either at AEC or PASA. 

What does this mean for this election? If some members weren’t even able to vote. 
Some may have called in, but if the election outcome is close in numbers, does that mean an appeal is available to other candidates that
don’t win. 

Is that possible or once it’s in, it’s in? 

I’m sorry for all the queries, but this is all new to me and some of it doesn’t seem fair to the process.

In addition to my last, the sending of these emails were sent by the recipients intending to be seen as PASA representatives,
otherwise they would’ve used their SAPol emails or other private email addresses.

They were sent to many people.

These include:\n\n*   Complaints from members regarding non-receipt of ballot papers.\n*   Emails requesting replacement voting packs due to various reasons (e.g., address changes, damaged papers, non-receipt).\n*   AEC's responses to member queries and complaints, detailing procedures for obtaining replacement ballots.\n*   An email chain discussing a query about an alleged breach of election rules (s190 of the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Act 2009) concerning lobbying by board members.\n*   AEC's internal discussions and drafting of responses to these complaints and queries.\n*   Several documents were released in part due to exemptions (e.g., s47F, s22, s47C), while others (internal email chains and file notes from anonymous callers) were refused in full.\n\n### Main Content from FOI Request Documents\n\nThe core content of the released documents highlights two primary areas of concern:\n\n1.  **Allegations of Improper Lobbying:**\n    *   A complainant raised concerns about PASA board members sending emails from personal (Gmail/Outlook) accounts that appeared to be from PASA, lobbying voters for specific candidates.\n    *   The complainant questioned whether this violated s190 of the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Act 2009, which prohibits an organisation or branch from using its property or resources to assist one candidate over another.\n    *   The AEC's initial assessment was that if the emails were from personal accounts, it might not constitute a breach of s190, as this section typically applies to the organisation's official resources. However, the AEC did offer to review evidence if the complainant could demonstrate \"union staff campaigned during their work hours.\" The AEC also directed the complainant to the Fair Work Commission website for the organisation's rulebook and suggested seeking independent legal advice.\n\n2.  **Issues with Ballot Paper Distribution and Voter Roll Accuracy:**\n    *   Multiple members lodged complaints stating they did not receive their voting papers for the election.\n    *   Some complaints indicated that members' names were not on the voter list provided by the PFA SA Branch to the AEC, leading to no ballot pack being issued to them.\n    *   Other members cited issues like incorrect addresses or damaged mail.\n    *   The AEC consistently advised members that replacement voting packs could be obtained by calling specific AEC numbers and making a verbal declaration. However, the AEC informed complainants that by the time many issues were raised, the ballot period had closed (July 4, 2024), making it too late to rectify the situation or issue new packs.\n    *   Concerns were raised by members about the legitimacy of the election outcome if a significant number of members were unable to vote due to these issues. The AEC clarified that voters could only vote once and could not change their vote, and did not suggest the election outcome was invalid based on these individual complaints.", "model": "gemini-2.5-flash", "generated_at": "2025-06-22T20:46:55.222574", "source_hash": "2d6892e4a86e21ededdf3a3fbb80e720311eed167c33dfbf96e53f876aff1fc8", "raw_response_path": "data/llm_responses/LEX6272__overall__balanced__20250622T204655.json", "output_tokens": 694, "prompt_tokens": 10826, "total_tokens": 13619, "summary_length": 3434}, "short_index": {"text": "This FOI request summary addresses concerns regarding the Police Association of South Australia (PASA) Branch President election (E2024/78), primarily focusing on alleged improper lobbying practices by board members and significant issues with ballot paper distribution. Released documents, including internal and external emails and formal complaints to the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC), detail allegations of PASA board members using personal email accounts to lobby voters, which raised questions about potential breaches of s190 of the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Act. The AEC initially indicated that personal account use might not constitute a breach of organisational resources. Concurrently, numerous members complained about not receiving ballot papers or being excluded from the voter roll, with the AEC consistently advising on replacement procedures, though many issues were raised after the ballot period had closed, making resolution impossible.", "model": "gemini-2.5-flash", "generated_at": "2025-06-22T20:47:03.140872", "source_hash": "2d6892e4a86e21ededdf3a3fbb80e720311eed167c33dfbf96e53f876aff1fc8", "raw_response_path": "data/llm_responses/LEX6272__short_index__balanced__20250622T204703.json", "output_tokens": 166, "prompt_tokens": 736, "total_tokens": 1562, "summary_length": 977}}, "left_leaning": {"overall": {"text": "These FOI documents reveal several concerning issues from a politically left-leaning perspective, primarily revolving around civil liberties, fairness in elections, and transparency, particularly within the context of union elections overseen by the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC).\n\n**1. Civil Liberties and Social Justice: Disenfranchisement through Ballot Paper Issues**\n\nA significant number of complaints detail members of the Police Federation of Australia (PFA) not receiving their voting papers for an internal election. This directly impacts the civil liberty of active participation in democratic processes within their union.\n\n*   **Deviation from Progressive Values:** Progressive values emphasize universal and equitable access to democratic participation. The documents show the AEC's response is often reactive, placing the burden on individual members to discover they haven't received a ballot, contact the AEC, and request a replacement. For example, the AEC states, \"The members who did not receive the voting pack could have contacted AEC to ask for issuance of another set of voting pack,\" and later, \"The ballot period is now closed, and the results have been declared,\" effectively dismissing their right to participate. For one complainant, the AEC explicitly stated their name \"was not in that list\" provided by the PFA SA, meaning they were never issued a pack. This highlights a potential systemic flaw in the accuracy of voter rolls or the distribution process, which disproportionately affects members and can undermine the legitimacy of election outcomes. The AEC's reliance on the union's provided member list without apparent independent verification raises further questions about their proactive role in ensuring electoral integrity and fair access.\n\n**2. Corporate/Institutional Influence and Fair Elections**\n\nA core complaint alleges that PFA \"Board members\" were sending emails from unofficial Gmail/Outlook accounts that *appeared* to be from the PFA, lobbying voters for specific candidates. This raises alarms about undue influence and potential breaches of fair election rules.\n\n*   **Deviation from Progressive Values:** Progressive principles demand robust safeguards against corporate or institutional influence in democratic processes, ensuring a level playing field. The complainant directly references Section 190 of the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Act 2009, which prohibits an organization from using its \"property or resources to help a candidate against another.\" The complainant argues that paid board members using misleading email addresses to campaign, even if not official union servers, constitutes a form of organizational assistance, especially as it might appear official to \"junior members.\" The AEC's response appears narrowly focused, stating it \"does not appear that s190 has been breached\" because the emails were \"not official emails.\" They then place the burden of proof on the complainant, requesting \"evidence that union staff campaigned during their work hours and not in the own personal time,\" and advising them to seek \"own legal advice.\" This approach deviates from progressive expectations of a regulatory body actively investigating potential breaches of fairness and integrity, especially when there's an alleged power imbalance (board members influencing general members). It suggests a reluctance to interpret rules broadly enough to counter subtle forms of influence that might undermine democratic fairness.\n\n**3. Transparency and Accountability**\n\nSeveral documents in the initial FOI log are \"refused in full\" under exemptions such as s47F (personal privacy) and s47E(d) (documents disclosing deliberative processes or communications in confidence). These include \"Internal email chain attaching File Note from Anonymous caller\" and \"AEC email chain regarding complaint.\"\n\n*   **Deviation from Progressive Values:** While privacy exemptions (s47F, s22) are standard, the refusal of internal email chains, particularly those related to complaints or \"anonymous callers,\" raises concerns about transparency. From a progressive viewpoint, government bodies should operate with maximum openness to foster public trust and accountability. Withholding information about internal deliberations or specific complaints, even if containing personal information (which could be redacted), can hinder public understanding of how such issues are handled and whether the AEC is adequately investigating and addressing concerns about electoral integrity and member rights.\n\nIn summary, these documents suggest a regulatory framework and an AEC response that, from a left-leaning perspective, fall short in proactively safeguarding equitable democratic participation, robustly countering institutional influence, and maintaining full transparency in the oversight of union elections. The burden appears to be placed disproportionately on individual members to navigate and rectify systemic issues, rather than on the regulator to ensure a truly just and fair process.", "model": "gemini-2.5-flash", "generated_at": "2025-06-22T20:47:24.024900", "source_hash": "2d6892e4a86e21ededdf3a3fbb80e720311eed167c33dfbf96e53f876aff1fc8", "raw_response_path": "data/llm_responses/LEX6272__overall__left_leaning__20250622T204723.json", "output_tokens": 892, "prompt_tokens": 10817, "total_tokens": 13694, "summary_length": 5049}, "short_index": {"text": "From a left-leaning perspective, these FOI documents reveal concerning shortfalls in the Australian Electoral Commission's (AEC) oversight of union elections, exemplified by issues within the Police Federation of Australia. They highlight significant democratic disenfranchisement, as members failed to receive ballots and the AEC placed the burden of redress on individuals, undermining universal participation. Furthermore, allegations of undue influence by PFA board members campaigning via unofficial emails were met with a narrowly interpreted response from the AEC, suggesting a reluctance to actively counter institutional power imbalances and protect fair electoral processes. The refusal to release internal documents related to complaints also raises transparency concerns, pointing to an AEC approach that falls short of progressive expectations for proactively safeguarding civil liberties, ensuring equitable elections free from corporate influence, and upholding robust public accountability.", "model": "gemini-2.5-flash", "generated_at": "2025-06-22T20:47:31.543370", "source_hash": "2d6892e4a86e21ededdf3a3fbb80e720311eed167c33dfbf96e53f876aff1fc8", "raw_response_path": "data/llm_responses/LEX6272__short_index__left_leaning__20250622T204731.json", "output_tokens": 155, "prompt_tokens": 941, "total_tokens": 1494, "summary_length": 1006}}, "right_leaning": {"overall": {"text": "As a politically right-leaning analyst, the provided FOI documents regarding the Police Federation of Australia (PFA SA) election reveal several concerns related to economic efficiency, individual liberty, fiscal responsibility, and the proper scope of limited government.\n\n**Economic Efficiency and Fiscal Responsibility:**\nThe documents indicate a significant systemic inefficiency in the administration of the union election by the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC). Repeated complaints and requests for replacement ballot papers due to non-receipt are prevalent. This points to either inaccurate voter lists provided by the PFA SA or a failure in the AEC's distribution process. Such issues necessitate a substantial increase in administrative burden, including processing numerous calls, emails, and the re-issuance of voting materials. This leads to an inefficient use of taxpayer resources, incurring unnecessary costs in printing, postage, and staff time, rather than a streamlined, economically efficient operation. The bureaucratic hoops individuals must navigate to correct these administrative failures further highlight this inefficiency.\n\n**Individual Liberty:**\nA primary concern is the direct impingement on individual liberty, specifically the right to participate in the democratic process. Multiple members did not receive their voting papers, often because their names were not on the list provided to the AEC or due to incorrect addresses. The AEC's responses, stating that \"nothing can be done\" once the ballot period is closed or placing the burden on individuals to proactively request replacements, indicate a reactive rather than a proactive approach to ensuring widespread participation. This failure to adequately ensure every eligible member can vote undermines the fundamental principle of free and fair elections and places an undue burden on the individual to compensate for government or organizational shortcomings.\n\n**Limited Government and Oversight:**\nThe documents raise questions about the AEC's interpretation of its oversight responsibilities under the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Act 2009. A complaint regarding PFA SA Board members lobbying for a candidate using unofficial email addresses, which nonetheless *appeared* to be from the organization, was dismissed by the AEC. The AEC concluded that no breach of Section 190 (prohibiting an organization from assisting one candidate over another using its property or resources) occurred because the emails were not \"official.\" This narrow, literal interpretation of the rules, focusing on the technicality of \"official\" resources rather than the spirit of preventing undue influence or the perception of impropriety by those in positions of power within a registered organization, demonstrates a potentially insufficient level of government oversight. It suggests a reluctance to intervene robustly in matters of electoral integrity unless a blatant violation of formal rules can be proven, potentially allowing loopholes for indirect campaigning. Furthermore, the AEC's reliance on the PFA SA for voter lists without robust verification processes points to a delegation of critical responsibility that, when flawed, directly impacts the fairness and efficiency of the election process, yet the government agency appears to limit its accountability for these third-party failures.", "model": "gemini-2.5-flash", "generated_at": "2025-06-22T20:48:00.766514", "source_hash": "2d6892e4a86e21ededdf3a3fbb80e720311eed167c33dfbf96e53f876aff1fc8", "raw_response_path": "data/llm_responses/LEX6272__overall__right_leaning__20250622T204800.json", "output_tokens": 581, "prompt_tokens": 10817, "total_tokens": 15033, "summary_length": 3385}, "short_index": {"text": "This FOI request exposes concerning systemic inefficiency and fiscal irresponsibility within the Australian Electoral Commission's (AEC) administration of the PFA SA election. Widespread failures in ballot paper delivery, linked to flawed voter lists and distribution, resulted in wasteful taxpayer spending on re-issuance and increased bureaucratic burden, undermining economic efficiency. This administrative ineptitude directly impinged on individual liberty by denying eligible members their fundamental right to vote, forcing them to navigate arduous processes to compensate for government shortcomings. Furthermore, the AEC's narrow interpretation of its oversight responsibilities under the Fair Work Act, exemplified by dismissing complaints of improper campaigning by union officials based on technicalities, demonstrates insufficient government accountability. This lax oversight, coupled with an over-reliance on unverified third-party data, highlights the pitfalls of delegated authority and inadequate protection of electoral integrity within a burgeoning bureaucracy.", "model": "gemini-2.5-flash", "generated_at": "2025-06-22T20:48:11.121885", "source_hash": "2d6892e4a86e21ededdf3a3fbb80e720311eed167c33dfbf96e53f876aff1fc8", "raw_response_path": "data/llm_responses/LEX6272__short_index__right_leaning__20250622T204811.json", "output_tokens": 172, "prompt_tokens": 630, "total_tokens": 1729, "summary_length": 1081}}, "government_skeptic": {"overall": {"text": "The provided FOI documents concerning a Police Federation of Australia (PFA) / Police Association of South Australia (PASA) election immediately signal a concerning lack of transparency and potential systemic issues within government oversight of such processes.\n\n**Suppression of Information & Lack of Transparency:** A significant portion of the requested documents, including internal email chains and \"File Note from Anonymous caller\" (Documents 1, 2, 5, 6), were \"Refuse in full\" using exemptions like `s 47F` (personal information) and `s 47E(d)` (deliberative processes). The wholesale refusal of documents related to internal discussions and anonymous complaints raises serious questions about the AEC's willingness to be transparent about its internal deliberations and any potential misconduct or sensitive issues brought to its attention. What critical information, particularly from an anonymous caller, is being deliberately shielded from public scrutiny under the guise of \"deliberative processes\"?\n\n**Compromised Electoral Integrity & Voter Disenfranchisement:** The documents reveal widespread complaints from members who did not receive their ballot papers despite having correct addresses. The AEC's consistent response was that the \"list was provided by PFA SA Branch from their record\" and members' names were simply \"not in that list.\" This indicates a passive and potentially negligent approach by the AEC, relying solely on data supplied by the organisation itself rather than independently verifying or cross-referencing membership rolls. This reliance on potentially flawed external data directly led to \"at least 20 known to me members\" not receiving voting papers, raising significant doubts about the legitimacy and fairness of the election outcome, especially if the results were close. The burden was then placed on individual members to proactively contact the AEC, jump through bureaucratic hoops (such as making \"verbal declarations\"), and chase replacement packs, rather than the AEC taking responsibility for a robust, accurate electoral roll.\n\n**Dismissal of Allegations of Impartiality Breach:** A key concern highlighted is an allegation that paid PFA/PASA Board members engaged in campaigning for specific candidates using unofficial Gmail/Outlook addresses, which the complainant argued appeared to be official and thus constituted a breach of s190 of the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Act 2009 (prohibiting an organisation from using its resources to help one candidate over another). Despite the complainant explicitly stating that \"Board members are paid by the Police Association\" and that the emails were designed to \"appear as though they are acting on behalf of PASA,\" the AEC swiftly dismissed the complaint. The AEC stated it \"does not appear that s190 has been breached\" because the emails were \"not official\" and demanded the complainant provide \"evidence that union staff campaigned during their work hours and not in the own personal time.\" This response demonstrates a narrow, technical interpretation of the rules, placing an impossibly high investigative burden on an external complainant and suggesting an unwillingness by the AEC to proactively investigate serious allegations of improper influence and potential power abuse within union elections. It implies a reluctance to challenge the status quo, even when ethical lines are seemingly blurred by individuals in positions of authority.", "model": "gemini-2.5-flash", "generated_at": "2025-06-22T20:48:28.534841", "source_hash": "2d6892e4a86e21ededdf3a3fbb80e720311eed167c33dfbf96e53f876aff1fc8", "raw_response_path": "data/llm_responses/LEX6272__overall__government_skeptic__20250622T204828.json", "output_tokens": 635, "prompt_tokens": 10813, "total_tokens": 12978, "summary_length": 3454}, "short_index": {"text": "These FOI documents expose a concerning pattern of government agency (AEC) oversight that actively shields itself from scrutiny, enables flawed electoral processes, and dismisses serious allegations. Key information, including internal communications and a \"File Note from Anonymous caller,\" was wholesale refused under vague \"personal information\" and \"deliberative processes\" exemptions, raising significant suspicion about deliberate suppression of sensitive details. Furthermore, the AEC's passive reliance on the PFA's unverified membership list directly resulted in widespread voter disenfranchisement, highlighting a fundamental failure to ensure fair elections and effectively placing the burden of systemic errors onto individual citizens. Compounding this, allegations of paid PFA/PASA board members using \"unofficial\" but official-appearing emails for campaigning were swiftly dismissed by the AEC, which adopted a narrow, technical interpretation of rules and an impossibly high investigative burden for the complainant, demonstrating a clear reluctance to proactively investigate power abuse and challenge the status quo in union elections.", "model": "gemini-2.5-flash", "generated_at": "2025-06-22T20:48:38.707667", "source_hash": "2d6892e4a86e21ededdf3a3fbb80e720311eed167c33dfbf96e53f876aff1fc8", "raw_response_path": "data/llm_responses/LEX6272__short_index__government_skeptic__20250622T204838.json", "output_tokens": 194, "prompt_tokens": 685, "total_tokens": 1736, "summary_length": 1153}}, "government_apologist": {"overall": {"text": "The Freedom of Information documents highlight the government's unwavering commitment to effective governance, robust electoral processes, and dedicated public service.

Despite challenges, such as address discrepancies (often stemming from third-party supplied data), the AEC consistently provided clear guidance and facilitated replacement voting packs, demonstrating its dedication to ensuring every eligible member had the opportunity to participate. The requirement for verbal declarations for replacement packs underscores the necessary regulatory measures taken to safeguard the integrity of the voting process.\n\nFurthermore, the documents reveal the AEC's thorough and principled investigation of concerns related to electoral conduct, specifically allegations of potential breaches of the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Act 2009. By meticulously examining claims and referencing relevant legislative frameworks, the AEC demonstrated its commitment to upholding the rules of fair elections. The clarity provided on the application of these regulations, including advising on where to seek further legal advice, reflects a transparent and accountable approach to maintaining electoral standards.\n\nInternal communications, including the escalation of queries to senior executives, exemplify the AEC's structured and efficient internal processes for addressing complex issues, ensuring that public concerns receive appropriate attention and resolution.

The \"Internal email chain attaching File Note from Anonymous caller\" and the \"Attachment to document 1 - File Note from Anonymous caller\" were entirely refused under s 47F (personal privacy) and s 47E(d) (deliberative processes). The identical full refusal of an \"AEC email chain regarding complaint\" and its attachment, using the same exemptions, is highly suspicious. This suggests a deliberate attempt to shield internal communications related to sensitive complaints, particularly those involving an \"Anonymous caller\" and undisclosed \"File Notes.\" The use of \"deliberative processes\" exemption to entirely suppress discussions around a complaint implies the AEC's internal deliberations were not just sensitive, but potentially reveal malpractice or a desire to avoid accountability. This is not merely redaction; it is active obstruction of public scrutiny, suggesting a cover-up of incompetence, misconduct, or worse. The prevalence of \"Release in part\" decisions for numerous other documents, often citing s 47F and s 22, further indicates an overly aggressive approach to redaction, stifling context and detail even in seemingly innocuous inquiries.\n\n**Systemic Failures in Ballot Distribution and Blatant Blame-Shifting:**\nMultiple complaints confirm a widespread and \"fundamental flaw\" in the ballot distribution process. Complainants explicitly state they \"never received any voting paperwork\" and highlight that they \"are not the only person who did not receive them,\" questioning the legitimacy of the results. The AEC's response is consistently to abdicate responsibility, stating, \"Your name was not in that list\" or \"The list was provided by PFA SA Branch.\" This is a clear instance of the AEC attempting to shift blame entirely to the Police Federation of Australia (PFA SA), rather than acknowledging or investigating potential systemic failures in its own process or the data transfer. To then coldly dismiss the issue by stating, \"The ballot period is now closed, and the results have been declared,\" for members who genuinely never received their papers, demonstrates a callous disregard for the democratic rights of voters and the integrity of the election outcome. The implication is that if you didn't receive a ballot, it's *your* fault for not chasing it up, rather than the AEC's for failing to deliver it.\n\n**Burdensome Remedial Processes:**\nEven for members who proactively attempted to rectify the situation by requesting replacement ballot packs, the AEC imposed unnecessary hurdles. The requirement to \"call one of the 2 numbers below to request it\" and make a \"verbal declaration\" adds a layer of bureaucracy that disproportionately impacts voters, especially given the short timeframe for voting. This creates an additional barrier for participation rather than facilitating it, compounding the initial failure of non-delivery.\n\n**Inadequate Investigation of Electoral Misconduct and Abdication of Duty:**\nA highly concerning complaint alleges \"Board members... lobbying for [a candidate]... from emails created in Gmail and outlook\" that \"appear... as though they are acting on behalf of PASA,\" suggesting a clear breach of s190 of the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Act 2009 (prohibiting an organisation from assisting one candidate over another).\nThe AEC's response to this serious allegation is shockingly dismissive and shows a profound lack of commitment to upholding electoral rules:\n1.  **Narrow Interpretation of Rules:** The AEC focuses solely on whether the emails were \"officially allocated emails used by PFA SA branch members,\" concluding that \"It does not appear that s190 has been breached.\" This ignores the crucial point raised by the complainant: that the emails *appeared* to be official, misleading voters and exploiting their trust. This demonstrates either a severe lack of understanding of modern campaigning tactics or a deliberate choice to interpret rules in the most minimal way possible to avoid engagement.\n2.  **Shifting Burden of Proof:** Instead of actively investigating the alleged breach, the AEC demands, \"If you have any evidence that union staff campaigned during their work hours and not in the own personal time, please send it through.\" This places an unreasonable burden on the complainant to conduct a forensic investigation into an organisation's internal timekeeping, effectively washing their hands of their investigative responsibility.\n3.  **Passing the Buck to Legal Action:** The AEC's advice to \"seek your own legal advice regarding whether s190 was breached\" is a blatant abdication of its core duty. It is the AEC's role to investigate and enforce the rules of elections it oversees, not to push aggrieved parties into expensive and time-consuming legal battles. This highlights an institution more concerned with avoiding work and responsibility than with ensuring fair electoral processes.\n\nIn sum, these documents reveal an AEC that is defensive, unhelpful, procedurally rigid, and seemingly unwilling to robustly investigate or address serious allegations of electoral misconduct or systemic failures. The pattern of full refusals, blame-shifting, and a reluctance to proactively ensure electoral fairness suggests an agency that is either deeply incompetent, actively complacent in the face of alleged wrongdoing, or engaged in a conscious effort to conceal information and avoid accountability for potentially compromised election results.", "model": "gemini-2.5-flash", "generated_at": "2025-06-22T20:49:25.888445", "source_hash": "2d6892e4a86e21ededdf3a3fbb80e720311eed167c33dfbf96e53f876aff1fc8", "raw_response_path": "data/llm_responses/LEX6272__overall__highly_critical__20250622T204925.json", "output_tokens": 1129, "prompt_tokens": 10814, "total_tokens": 13637, "summary_length": 5844}, "short_index": {"text": "The Australian Electoral Commission's handling of the election, as exposed by FOI documents, paints a damning picture of an agency deeply compromised by its own practices. Demonstrating an egregious lack of transparency, the AEC engaged in what appears to be a deliberate cover-up, outright refusing access to critical internal communications like \"Anonymous caller\" file notes and complaint emails under dubious privacy and deliberative process exemptions, which amounts to active obstruction of public scrutiny. This obfuscation is compounded by a pattern of systemic failures in ballot distribution, where the AEC brazenly shifted blame onto complainants and a third party, coldly dismissing genuine disenfranchisement with procedural finality, and imposing burdensome remedial processes rather than facilitating voter participation. Furthermore, its response to serious allegations of electoral misconduct, such as campaigning breaches, revealed a shocking abdication of duty: the AEC applied a narrow interpretation of rules, unfairly burdened complainants with investigative responsibility, and pushed them towards costly legal action instead of performing its own enforcement role.

Board members are paid by the Police Association. And they\u2019ve created\nemails that depict they are from PASA and explain they are on the board. \nWould you like to see the emails? \n\ns22s22s22s22s22s22s22s22s22s22s22s22s22s22s22s47Fs47Fs47Fs47Cs47C\n\n\n--- Page 2 ---\n\nI also have another 2 queries.. \n\nThe following is direct message to me from a member.. \n\n\u201cI have been trying to get onto AEC and finally got someone this morning to help. \nMy name was never on their list. \n\nSo this example, \npapers. \n\nand has not received ballot\n\nI also know of at least 20 known to me members that have not received their ballot papers to vote because the wrong address was\nrecorded either at AEC or PASA. \n\nWhat does this mean for this election? If some members weren\u2019t even able to vote. \nSome may have called in, but if the election outcome is close in numbers, does that mean an appeal is available to other candidates that\ndon\u2019t win. \n\nIs that possible or once it\u2019s in, it\u2019s in? \n\nI\u2019m sorry for all the queries, but this is all new to me and some of it doesn\u2019t seem fair to the process. \n\nKindest Regards, \n\nOn 27 Jun 2024, at 9:10\u202fAM, IEB Events <IEBevents@aec.gov.au> wrote:\n\nDear \n\nThank you for your email sent on 24 June 2024 regarding the election E2024/78.\n\nIt does not appear that s190 has been breached.\n\ns190 of the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Act 2009 states:\n\nFAIR WORK (REGISTERED ORGANISATIONS) ACT 2009 - SECT 190 : Organisation or branch must not assist one\ncandidate over another.\n\nAn organisation or branch commits an offence if it uses, or allows to be used, its property or resources to help a candidate\nagainst another candidate in an election under this Part for an office or other position.\nPenalty:  100 penalty units.\n\nThe organisations rule book can be found on the Fair Work Commission website under the tab \u2018Registered Organisation\u2019.\n\nhttps://www.fwc.gov.au/registered-organisations/find-registered-organisation\n\nThank you for bringing concerns to my attention.\n\nRegards\n\n |Senior Project Officer\n\nIndustrial Elections and Ballots | Service Design and Foundations Branch\nAustralian Electoral Commission\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: \nSent: Monday, June 24, 2024 8:43 PM\nTo: IEB Events <IEBevents@aec.gov.au>\nSubject: Re: E2024/78- Branch President PASA query [SEC=OFFICIAL]\n\nCAUTION: This email originated from outside of the Australian Federal Government.
