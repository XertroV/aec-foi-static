      <h2>Summary of FOI Request Documents (FOI Request No. LEX3037)</h2>
<h3>Main Purpose of the FOI Request</h3>
<p>The FOI request (No. LEX3037) sought "all correspondence about compliance with the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 or relating to elections in 2022" between the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) and major technology companies. These companies include US technology firms such as Meta (Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp), Twitter, Google, Telegram, and LinkedIn, as well as Chinese technology company ByteDance (TikTok). The request specifically covered correspondence created between 28/1/2022 to the date of the request.</p>
<h3>Documents from the FOI Request</h3>
<p>The released documents consist primarily of:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Schedules of Released Documents:</strong> Detailed lists of individual documents (emails, letters, agendas, reports) with dates and descriptions.</li>
<li><strong>Electoral Communications Escalation Scenarios:</strong> A document dated 29 October 2021 (with an updated version by Google on 7 April 2022) outlining 11 scenarios of electoral communications that could infringe Commonwealth law or platform policy.</li>
<li><strong>Emails and Letters:</strong> Extensive correspondence between the AEC and:<ul>
<li><strong>Microsoft:</strong> Emails and letters related to "Electoral Integrity Assurance Taskforce" meetings and content referrals.</li>
<li><strong>Google (including YouTube):</strong> Numerous emails regarding content referrals, election integrity briefings, and "Your Request to Google" messages for content review and removal.</li>
<li><strong>TikTok:</strong> Emails concerning content referrals, escalation processes, and updates regarding election content.</li>
<li><strong>Twitter:</strong> A large volume of emails related to content referrals concerning election integrity and civic-related content.</li>
<li><strong>Meta (Facebook/Instagram):</strong> Emails regarding content requests, post-election wrap-ups, and a detailed document outlining Meta's preparations for the 2022 Australian Election.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Meeting Agendas:</strong> Agendas for meetings between the AEC's Electoral Integrity Assurance Taskforce (EIAT) and representatives from Microsoft, Google, TikTok, Twitter, and Meta.</li>
<li><strong>Reports/Briefings:</strong> An undated document titled "How Meta is Preparing for the 2022 Australian Election."</li>
</ul>
<p>While Telegram and LinkedIn were mentioned in the FOI request, no specific documents pertaining to these companies were listed in the released schedule.</p>
<h3>Main Content from the FOI Request Documents</h3>
<p>The documents reveal the AEC's proactive engagement with major tech companies to safeguard the integrity of the 2022 Australian federal election, primarily focusing on combating misinformation, disinformation, and non-compliant electoral communications.</p>
<p><strong>Key Themes and Content:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Electoral Communications Escalation Scenarios:</strong> This foundational document served as a guide for identifying and escalating problematic content. It details scenarios ranging from:</p>
<ul>
<li>Unauthorised paid electoral advertisements (Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918, s 321D).</li>
<li>Misleading voters on how to cast their votes (s 329).</li>
<li>Impersonation of Commonwealth officials or entities.</li>
<li>Communications by foreign entities.</li>
<li>Foreign interference and threats of terrorist action.</li>
<li>Anonymous electoral communications.</li>
<li>Defamatory content or content bringing a Commonwealth agency into disrepute.</li>
<li>Hate speech.</li>
<li>Other communications that breach platform policies (e.g., spam, false news).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Collaboration and Communication Channels:</strong> The correspondence highlights the establishment and use of direct communication channels between the AEC's Electoral Integrity Assurance Taskforce (EIAT), Authorisation Section, and Social Media teams with the tech companies. This includes dedicated email addresses for content referrals and regular meetings to discuss election preparedness, integrity measures, and emerging threats.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Content Referrals and Moderation:</strong> A significant portion of the correspondence involves the AEC referring specific content for review and potential removal by the platforms. Examples of content referred include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Google (YouTube):</strong> Videos containing unauthorised electoral matter (breaching s 321D CEA), privacy violations (e.g., recording without consent under Queensland law), and electoral disinformation (e.g., claims of election fraud). Google/YouTube's responses show content being blocked or removed for violating community guidelines, or in some cases, not meeting their legal policies for removal.</li>
<li><strong>TikTok:</strong> Posts misleading about voter enrolment deadlines, videos making false claims about election fraud and lack of authorisation, accounts impersonating the AEC, and videos filmed inside polling places without permission or recording AEC staff without consent. TikTok's responses consistently indicate content or accounts were reviewed and removed for violating their community guidelines.</li>
<li><strong>Twitter:</strong> Numerous instances of the AEC flagging tweets related to "election integrity and/or civic-related content" and "electoral misinformation." The specific actions taken by Twitter on these flagged items are often noted as "we have an answer about..." or involve requests for more information.</li>
<li><strong>Meta:</strong> Referrals for Facebook posts regarding electorates and other content requests. The nature of these specific content breaches is less detailed in the provided schedule descriptions, but Meta confirms receipt of these requests.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Platform-Specific Election Integrity Initiatives:</strong> Documents also detail the tech companies' own efforts to ensure election integrity:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Meta:</strong> Expanded third-party fact-checking (e.g., RMIT FactLab joining AFP, AAP), public awareness campaigns (e.g., "Check the Facts" in multiple languages), efforts to combat coordinated inauthentic behaviour, security programs (Facebook Protect for candidates), mandatory transparency for political ads ("Paid for by" disclaimers, Ad Library), and civic engagement features (voter reminders, Instagram stickers).</li>
<li><strong>Google:</strong> Election integrity briefings, and guidance on how to flag issues on their platforms (Search, Ads, YouTube).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In summary, the documents illustrate a collaborative effort between the AEC and major social media platforms to identify, monitor, and address electoral misinformation, non-compliance with Australian electoral law, and other integrity threats during the 2022 federal election, primarily through established communication channels and content moderation processes.</p>

      <p>The FOI documents detail correspondence between the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) and major technology companies (Google, Meta, Twitter, TikTok, Microsoft) concerning the integrity of the 2022 Australian federal election. This interaction centers on identifying and responding to various forms of problematic online content, ranging from electoral misinformation to potential foreign interference.</p>
<p><strong>Corporate Influence &amp; Wealth Distribution:</strong><br />
The documents reveal a significant reliance by the AEC on large, for-profit global technology companies to maintain electoral integrity online. The "Electoral Integrity Assurance Taskforce" and its consistent engagement with these tech giants highlight a model where essential democratic functions – policing disinformation, managing communication, and enforcing electoral law online – are largely outsourced to private entities. This aligns with a progressive critique regarding the undue influence of powerful corporations over public infrastructure and democratic processes. While these companies commit resources (e.g., Meta's stated $5-7 billion investment in safety/security), the fundamental power asymmetry is clear: public institutions are dependent on the willingness and operational decisions of private corporations, whose primary obligation is to shareholders. This central role of tech companies in mediating national discourse underscores concerns about wealth concentration and the privatization of public goods, where profits are privatized but societal risks, like disinformation, are broadly socialized.</p>
<p><strong>Social Justice:</strong><br />
From a social justice perspective, the AEC's efforts, supported by these platforms, to combat misinformation and unauthorized electoral communications are broadly aligned with ensuring a fair and informed democratic process, a cornerstone of social justice. The detection and removal of content designed to mislead voters on how to cast votes (Scenario 2), impersonate officials (Scenario 3), or contain hate speech (Scenario 10) directly contribute to a more equitable and safe electoral environment. Meta's initiative to translate its "Check the Facts" media literacy campaign into Vietnamese, Simplified Chinese, and Arabic is a notable positive step, promoting linguistic diversity and ensuring broader access to accurate information for non-English speaking communities. However, the reactive nature of many content moderation efforts, relying on reports and post-publication removal, may be insufficient to proactively protect marginalized groups from targeted disinformation campaigns.</p>
<p><strong>Civil Liberties:</strong><br />
The documents highlight a delicate balance between safeguarding electoral integrity and upholding civil liberties, particularly freedom of expression. The AEC's focus on transparency in political advertising (requiring authorization, combating anonymous communications) generally aligns with progressive values by promoting accountability and informed voter choice. However, scenarios like "electoral communication…brings a Commonwealth agency into disrepute" (Scenario 9) raise concerns. From a left-leaning perspective, such a broad category could potentially be used to stifle legitimate criticism or dissent against government bodies, blurring the line between protecting democratic institutions and suppressing free speech. Furthermore, the power of tech platforms to remove content based on their internal "Platform policy" even when no Commonwealth law is breached (Scenario 11) indicates a significant, non-democratically accountable power to regulate public discourse, which could inadvertently lead to censorship or limit diverse viewpoints. Conversely, instances where Google declined removal requests because content didn't breach <em>legal policies</em> (though it might violate platform terms) suggest a degree of adherence to legal frameworks over blanket censorship.</p>
<p><strong>Environmental Impact:</strong><br />
Direct mentions of environmental impact are absent from these documents, as their scope is strictly electoral integrity. However, Meta's "social issue ads" policy, which includes "environmental politics" as an area requiring transparency, suggests a superficial alignment with environmental transparency efforts by requiring disclosure for related political advertisements. This is not an assessment of environmental impact itself, but rather a regulatory framework around communication on the topic.</p>
<p>In summary, while the government's actions, through the AEC, align with progressive values in seeking to protect democratic integrity, ensure transparency in political communication, and combat harmful speech, the profound reliance on opaque, for-profit corporate entities to achieve these goals represents a significant deviation. This dependency raises concerns about corporate influence, the ultimate accountability of content moderation decisions, and the potential for a chilling effect on civil liberties, highlighting a need for stronger public governance and oversight of digital information spaces.</p>

    <div class="ai-summary-markdown-content">
      <p>These FOI documents reveal extensive communication and collaboration between the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) and major technology companies (Meta, Google, TikTok, Twitter, Microsoft) concerning the 2022 federal election. From a politically right-leaning analytical perspective, this interaction raises significant concerns regarding adherence to conservative principles, particularly individual liberty, limited government, and economic efficiency, while also noting aspects related to national security.</p>
<p><strong>Individual Liberty (Freedom of Speech):</strong> The documents demonstrate a proactive approach by the AEC to monitor and influence content on private digital platforms. The "Electoral Communications escalations scenarios" document outlines various categories for intervention, including "electoral communication that misleads voters" (Scenario 2), "impersonates a Commonwealth official" (Scenario 3), or "brings a Commonwealth agency into disrepute" (Scenario 9). Most concerning is Scenario 11, which permits escalation for "any other electoral communication that may not breach a Commonwealth law, but which may breach Platform policy." This last point signifies a deviation from conservative principles of free speech, suggesting a government-backed effort to manage the information environment by leveraging private companies' terms of service, effectively creating a form of censorship by proxy. Repeated emails show the AEC flagging content for removal, often successfully, for reasons ranging from "unauthorised" electoral matter to "electoral misinformation," and even for "recording AEC staff without consent." While combating genuine fraud or illegal impersonation aligns with public order, the broad scope of "misinformation" and "bringing agency into disrepute" opens the door to suppressing legitimate, albeit critical or unpopular, political expression and dissenting views. The focus on "fact-checking" that leads to "significantly reduc[ed] distribution" of content, as mentioned in Meta's preparatory document, further points to a managed discourse rather than a truly free exchange of ideas.</p>
<p><strong>Limited Government:</strong> The establishment and active operation of the "Electoral Integrity Assurance Taskforce" (EIAT) and its regular engagement with major tech companies represents a considerable expansion of government influence into the digital public square. This level of intervention goes beyond the traditional role of a limited government, as it involves an administrative body actively monitoring, flagging, and requesting the removal of content from private platforms, even when no explicit Commonwealth law is broken. Such collaboration blurs the lines between governmental authority and private corporate action, potentially deputizing tech companies as de facto enforcers of the government's preferred narrative. This overreach risks creating a precedent where government agencies can pressure private entities to restrict speech that is not illegal but deemed undesirable by the state.</p>
<p><strong>National Security (Foreign Interference):</strong> The documents do show alignment with conservative principles regarding national security by addressing foreign influence and interference (Scenarios 4 and 5). The concern about "electoral communication made by or on behalf of foreign person or entity that is registrable under the Foreign Influence Transparency Scheme Act 2018 (FITS Act)" and other forms of "foreign interference" reflects a legitimate interest in protecting national sovereignty. However, the "policy" definition of foreign interference, which includes promoting "divisive political positions designed to fragment the electorate" (Scenario 5), could be interpreted broadly, potentially sweeping in legitimate domestic political debate that is simply deemed "divisive" by government agencies. A conservative perspective would advocate for clear distinctions between genuine foreign espionage/meddling and domestic political discourse, even if robust or contentious.</p>
<p><strong>Economic Efficiency &amp; Fiscal Responsibility:</strong> While the documents do not provide specific cost figures, the existence of a dedicated "Electoral Integrity Assurance Taskforce," its regular meetings, and the volume of correspondence exchanged with multiple large tech companies imply a significant allocation of taxpayer resources (staff time, administrative overhead). From a fiscal responsibility standpoint, a right-leaning analysis would question whether such extensive government machinery dedicated to digital content policing is the most efficient and fiscally prudent use of public funds, especially when considering the potential impact on individual liberties.</p>
<p>In summary, while aspects of national security (countering foreign interference) align with conservative concerns, the overwhelming impression from these documents is one of government expansion and overreach into the digital speech domain. The extensive collaboration with tech companies for content moderation, particularly for content that does not violate Australian law but merely platform policy, represents a significant deviation from the core conservative principles of limited government and robust individual liberty, raising concerns about a managed public discourse rather than a truly free and open one.</p>

    <div class="ai-summary-markdown-content">
      <p>The released FOI documents paint a concerning picture of the Australian Electoral Commission's (AEC) deep and extensive collaboration with major technology companies (Google, TikTok, Twitter, Meta/Facebook, Microsoft) in the lead-up to the 2022 federal election. Far from merely enforcing Australian law, the documents reveal a proactive and arguably overreaching strategy by a government body to influence and control online discourse, often relying on the subjective "terms of service" of private corporations rather than the Commonwealth Electoral Act itself.</p>
<p>Key observations from a skeptical perspective:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Delegated Censorship and Overreach:</strong> The "Electoral Communications Escalation Scenarios" document (updated by Google, notably) explicitly includes "Scenario 11: Any other electoral communication that may not breach a Commonwealth law, but which may breach Platform policy." This is a critical admission: the AEC actively requests the removal of content <em>that is not illegal under Australian law</em>, instead leveraging the private, opaque, and often inconsistently applied "community guidelines" of tech platforms. This allows the government to bypass due process and legal scrutiny, effectively outsourcing censorship to unaccountable private entities.</li>
<li><strong>Corporate Influence on Government Policy:</strong> The fact that the "Electoral Communications Escalation Scenarios" document was "Updated by Google on 7 April 2022" is highly problematic. It suggests that a foreign private corporation is directly influencing or co-authoring the operational guidelines for an Australian government body concerning electoral communications. This blurs the lines of sovereignty and raises serious questions about undue corporate influence on public administration and democratic processes.</li>
<li><strong>Lack of Transparency and Accountability:</strong> The vast majority of the "released documents" are merely a schedule of correspondence, providing little to no insight into the actual content of the flagged material or the detailed justification for its referral. The numerous generic "Your Request has been received" and "Content has been removed" emails from tech companies offer minimal transparency, making it impossible for the public to scrutinize what content was targeted, why, or whether removals were justified. This opaque process undermines public trust in both government and tech platforms.</li>
<li><strong>Ambiguous Justifications for Removal:</strong> While some referrals relate to clear legal violations (e.g., impersonation of AEC officials), many are vaguely defined, such as "electoral misinformation" or "disinformation." For instance, a TikTok video accusing the AEC of "rigging the election" was removed. While such claims might be false, their removal by government-prompted corporate action raises concerns about suppressing critical, albeit erroneous, public discourse rather than engaging with it transparently. The removal of a video "filmed inside a polling place without permission, potentially identifies an AEC staff member" also suggests a move to control public documentation of electoral processes, potentially hindering transparency and public scrutiny.</li>
<li><strong>Resource Allocation and Inefficiency:</strong> The sheer volume of individual email referrals between the AEC and various platforms, often for minor or recurring issues (e.g., lack of proper authorisation on content), indicates a significant allocation of government resources to content policing. This manual, reactive approach raises questions about the efficient use of taxpayer money and whether such extensive surveillance and intervention in online speech is a primary or appropriate function for an electoral commission.</li>
</ul>
<p>In essence, these documents reveal an electoral body deeply entangled with private tech companies, not merely to enforce laws, but to actively manage and suppress online speech based on the platforms' own, often arbitrary, rules. This collaboration represents a quiet expansion of governmental control over information, achieved through a partnership with powerful, non-state actors, thereby circumventing traditional legal checks and balances and diminishing transparency.</p>

    <div class="ai-summary-markdown-content">
      <p>The released FOI documents demonstrate the Australian government's unwavering commitment to upholding the integrity and security of the 2022 federal election. Through the proactive efforts of the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) and its dedicated Electoral Integrity Assurance Taskforce (EIAT), robust frameworks and strong partnerships were established with major technology companies, including Google, Meta, TikTok, Twitter, and Microsoft.</p>
<p>A key highlight is the foresight shown in developing the "Electoral Communications Escalation Scenarios" well in advance of the election, outlining potential threats such as unauthorised advertising, misleading information, impersonation of officials, foreign interference, and hate speech. This strategic planning enabled the government to anticipate challenges and implement effective response mechanisms.</p>
<p>Throughout the election period, the AEC engaged in extensive and collaborative correspondence with these tech platforms. This engagement focused on critical areas such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Combating Misinformation and Disinformation:</strong> The AEC actively referred instances of electoral misinformation and content likely to mislead voters on how to cast their votes. Tech companies responded swiftly, with documents showing successful content removals and blocking of videos that violated electoral laws or platform policies.</li>
<li><strong>Ensuring Transparency and Authorisation:</strong> The government emphasised the necessity of proper authorisation for electoral communications, as mandated by the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918. This ensured voters were aware of the source of political messaging, promoting accountability.</li>
<li><strong>Protecting Against Impersonation:</strong> Swift action was taken to address instances of entities impersonating the AEC, with tech platforms promptly removing such deceptive accounts or content, thereby safeguarding public trust in official information sources.</li>
<li><strong>Upholding Privacy and Safety:</strong> Concerns regarding the unauthorised recording of AEC staff in polling places were immediately addressed, demonstrating the government's commitment to protecting the privacy and safety of those administering the election.</li>
<li><strong>Proactive Security Measures:</strong> Beyond reactive content moderation, the documents reveal Meta's comprehensive preparations, including expanding fact-checking programs, launching media literacy campaigns, combating influence operations, and offering security programs like "Facebook Protect" to candidates. Similarly, Google provided resources like its "Civics Training Centre" and political advertising transparency reports, empowering participants and the public.</li>
</ul>
<p>The numerous emails detailing content referrals and subsequent removals by the tech companies underscore the effectiveness of these collaborations. These efforts ensured that any challenges to the integrity of the electoral process were swiftly identified, managed, and mitigated, reinforcing the fairness and reliability of Australia's democratic system. The government's proactive engagement and strong partnerships with industry leaders were instrumental in delivering a secure and credible election for all Australians.</p>

    <div class="ai-summary-markdown-content">
      <p>The released FOI documents paint a damning picture of the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) and the Australian government's abject failure to assert sovereignty and control over the integrity of the 2022 federal election, instead ceding critical oversight to foreign-owned social media corporations.</p>
<p><strong>1. Abdication of Sovereignty and Legislative Failure:</strong><br />
The documents reveal a shocking reliance on the "community guidelines" and internal "legal policies" of foreign tech giants like Google, Meta, and TikTok, rather than robust Australian law. The AEC's own "Electoral Communications Escalation Scenarios" document explicitly admits a critical legal vacuum, noting that some issues "may not breach a Commonwealth law, but which may breach Platform policy." This is a catastrophic confession of legislative negligence, leaving fundamental aspects of Australian electoral integrity to the arbitrary whims of corporate terms of service. In one damning instance, the YouTube Legal Support Team flatly rejected an AEC request to restrict content, stating, "we didn't find grounds to restrict the URL(s) at issue under our legal policies," despite the AEC citing potential breaches of both Queensland privacy law and the Commonwealth Electoral Act. The AEC was then advised to "try to resolve any issues directly with the creator of the content" or "pursue legal action," exposing the AEC as utterly toothless in directly enforcing Australian law.</p>
<p><strong>2. Reactive and Overwhelmed Response to Pervasive Misinformation:</strong><br />
The sheer volume of content referral emails, particularly with Twitter and Meta, indicates an electoral environment plagued by widespread "misinformation," "disinformation," "impersonation," and "unauthorised communications." The AEC functions merely as a reactive reporting service, submitting a relentless stream of "requests" and "referrals" into corporate black boxes. This reactive approach, where the AEC must wait for platforms to "review" or "complete" actions, guarantees that harmful, misleading, or illegal content remains visible and influences voters during critical election periods. The constant "Your Request... has been received" emails highlight a process of passive submission rather than authoritative demand.</p>
<p><strong>3. Direct Admission of Vulnerability to Foreign Interference:</strong><br />
The AEC's own "Electoral Communications Escalation Scenarios" document contains a staggering admission: "Detection and attribution [of foreign interference] can be time and resource intensive, while disinformation strategies are cheap and agile." This is a public confession of the Australian government's severe incapacity and under-resourcing to effectively combat sophisticated, potentially state-sponsored, attacks on its democratic process. It suggests a known vulnerability that was not adequately addressed.</p>
<p><strong>4. Foreign Corporations Dictating Terms and Strategy:</strong><br />
The humiliating extent of the AEC's subservience is starkly evident in documents like the "Electoral Communications Escalation Scenarios" explicitly stating "Updated by Google," demonstrating that foreign corporations are directly shaping the frameworks intended to protect Australian elections. Furthermore, Meta's "How Meta is Preparing for the 2022 Australian Election" is presented as a released document, yet it is merely a corporate public relations piece outlining Meta's unilateral actions and significant internal investments. This underscores Meta's self-appointed role as an independent arbiter of Australian elections, without apparent direct control or directive from the AEC.</p>
<p><strong>5. Repeated Failures in Content Integrity:</strong><br />
The documents detail a litany of severe electoral malfeasance requiring external intervention:<br />
*   False claims of widespread election fraud, including "dead people are enrolled to vote" and "identification is not required to enrol to vote," being disseminated on platforms like TikTok.<br />
*   Direct impersonation of the AEC itself on TikTok.<br />
*   Illicit filming inside polling places and counting centres, including AEC staff without consent, coupled with "disinformation accusing the AEC of rigging the election."<br />
*   Unauthorised electoral advertising and communications, a direct breach of the Commonwealth Electoral Act, requiring AEC to report to platforms.<br />
The sheer frequency and gravity of these incidents reveal a profound breakdown in information integrity during the election, with the AEC relegated to merely flagging issues for companies to address on their own terms.</p>

Electoral communications escalation scenarios  

Commonwealth law 
infringed/issues 
Policy:  

FI is likely to be a break of 
platforms’ own terms of use 

Operational: 

Division 92, Part 5.2 
Criminal Code Act 1995  

Detection and attribution can 
be time and resource 
intensive, while 
disinformation strategies are 
cheap and agile. 

Scenario  Description 
5 

Foreign 
interference  

This scenario 
notes the 
difference 
between the 
legislated and 
policy definitions 
of “foreign 
interference”, and 
the differing 
approaches taken 
by policy agencies 
(CFICC), and 
operational 
agencies/bodies 
(including the CFI 
Taskforce). 

Examples 
Policy:  

Social media accounts 
that appear to: 

•  amplify, then 

consistently promote 
divisive political 
positions designed to 
fragment the 
electorate, 
•  target specific 

demographics within 
the electorate with 
messaging designed to 
influence voting 
behaviour. 

Operational:  

To be actionable under 
s92, FI activity must meet 
the elements specified in 
s92, notably: 1. Conduct; 
2. done on half 
of/directed by a Foreign 
Principal; 3. to achieve 
one of the four stated 
intentions; 4. done 
covertly/deceptively/with 
menace/etc 

6 

Electoral 
communication 
containing threats 
of terrorist action 

Electoral communication 
threatening terrorist 
action against polling 
booths and/or voters. 

Anti-terrorism laws and 
powers activated.

Electoral communications escalation scenarios  

Scenario  Description 
7 
Anonymous 
electoral 
communication 
(other than a paid 
advertisement) 
without 
authorisation 

Examples 
Anonymous 
communication 
promoting informal 
voting  

Commonwealth law 
infringed/issues 
Depends on who is 
communicating the matter 
as to whether the 
communication must be 
authorised under the 
Commonwealth Electoral 
Act 1918.  An electoral 
communication must be 
authorised if it is for, or on 
behalf of, a disclosure entity 
(i.e. a candidate, political 
party or other person or 
group that is required to 
report electoral expenditure 
or donations to the 
Electoral Commission under 
Part XX of the Electoral Act).

9 

Electoral 
communication 
(including a paid 
electoral ad) that 
is defamatory  

Third party authorises a 
paid advertisement that 
defames a candidate so 
as to affect public 
perception of the 
integrity of the 
candidate, party, election 
or political system.  

Affected individual or 
organisation can take legal 
action, however, issue may 
be to stop the spread of 
disinformation during an 
election campaign. 

Electoral 
communication 
(including a paid 
electoral ad) 
brings a 
Commonwealth 
agency into 
disrepute  

Third party authorises a 
paid advertisement that 
defames a 
Commonwealth agency 
or representative so as to 
affect public perception 
of the integrity of the 
electoral system. 

Affected individual or

action, however, issue may 
be to stop the spread of

Scenario  Description 
10 

Electoral 
communication 
(including a paid 
electoral ad) 
containing hate 
speech 

Examples 
Electoral communication 
on social media vilifying a 
person or group of 
people to influence 
voters. 

Commonwealth law 
infringed/issues 
Vilification or freedom of 
expression on the basis of 
race, religion, nationality, 
national or ethnic origin or 
political opinion. 

Some forms of online abuse 
may meet the threshold of 
cyberbullying or adult cyber 
abuse in the Online Safety 
Act 2021 and be subject to 
removal notices issued by 
the eSafety Commissioner. 

Other communications not 
covered by scenarios 7-9, 
where no Commonwealth 
law may have been 
infringed, but the 
communication 
nevertheless is spam or 
false news. 

11 

Any other 
electoral 
communication 
that may not 
breach a 
Commonwealth 
law, but which 
may breach 
Platform policy 

Video on social media 
promoting informal 
voting that provides 
incorrect information on 
the consequence of 
voting informally.

Hi Louise, 

Great to chat with you just just now and hello to the team. To recap our conversation:  

If the AEC has any legal removal requests please:  

 
 

Lodge the request at 
Send a note to me and cc

and 

 so we can ensure it is attended to promptly.  

If the AEC has a concern about any content or activity that is not a legal request but concerning anyway:  

  Please email me directly at 
 

From here I will be able to escalate to our Trust and Safety team or others as required. 

or ring on 

 if urgent.  

Backup contact if I am out of office is 
so someone will pick it up. If on a weekend/after hours feel free to call or text my mobile.  

google.com which is the whole Google Australia public policy team, 

The below links may also be of interest:  

 Google Civics Training Centre for candidates, parties, and campaigners including election security tutorials 
and tools. Google runs a training program in Australia for Members, Senators, staff, candidates and 
parties on how to use these tools.  

 Google&#39;s political advertising transparency report for Australia and Google&#39;s political advertising policy for 
Australia. Political ads are those that feature a political party, current elected officeholder or candidate 
for the House of Representatives or Senate. 

 A blog post from our Threat Analysis Group outlining some work during the most recent US Presidential 

election and the latest TAG report.  

If the team would like a refresher briefing on the political transparency program, please let me know.  

How to flag an issue on our platforms (all links publicly shareable).  

  Report Google Search results (organic)  
  Report Google Ads (paid ads at the top)  
  Report YouTube content 

From memory last election the AEC did include some of these links on its site to help the public know what to do if it 
saw concerning content on our platforms ‐‐ feel free to include them again if useful (we can assist with more 
detailed language and further guidance if helpful).  

Kind regards,

Dear Andrew and the AEC team, I hope this email finds you well and feeling rejuvenated after a summer
vacation?

With an eye to the upcoming Federal election, we&#39;d like to offer you a briefing on Google&#39;s election integrity
work from colleagues that have worked on elections in other countries. Just wanted to gauge your interest in
such a briefing and if so, when you would like the briefing to take place.

Kind regards

gov_explain: In the video there appears to be the following contraventions  

of s 44 Invasion of Privacy Act (QLD) (which is an indictable offence  

liable on conviction to a maximum penalty of 40 penalty units or  

imprisonment for 2 years):

•      5:49 – seen recording a conversation with a QLD police officer,

 no statement about consent to record.

•      3:25 - seen recording a phone call with a journalist (Channel 7 news) –  

states at 3:05 “I’m not going to be telling them I’m recording, because  

they’ll be recording it”

This is also a potential breach of Google&amp;#39;s &amp;#39;Respect Others&amp;#39; Term of  

Service, which requires that users &amp;quot;comply with applicable laws&amp;quot;  

and &amp;quot;respect the rights of others, including privacy... rights.&amp;quot;

The video is also not authorised in accordance with s 321D of the  

Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 (Cth), a civil penalty provision.

The AEC has previously written to the video creator,

 warning 

to authorise 

social media accounts and website.

gov_quote: 3:05 - “I’m not going to be telling them I’m recording, because  

they’ll be recording it” - this displays a contravention of s 44 Invasion  

of Privacy Act (QLD).

Additionally, the video is also not authorised in accordance with s 321D of  

the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 (Cth).

Hi team,

I’ve just lodged a webform (reference: CVL44I3JUPLFJ2RU3CHY3WQNRA) about 
, which has
been flagged with the AEC by social media users. Both the host and the guest repeatedly make misleading
claims that the Australian federal election was compromised by fraud throughout the first 20 minutes of the

19:20.

The TikTok Public Policy team will be in Canberra 1 July, and I was wondering whether it would be an 
opportune time for us to have a post-election catch up and potentially discuss the Statement of Intent 
and upcoming state elections. 

As you are aware we have been working closely with Evan&#39;s team and the EIIF as well, so we&#39;d be 
happy to meet with everyone together but I thought I would reach out to you first.

Let me know your thoughts!

With regards to the agenda - I will give an update on TikTok&#39;s election prepardness work and support from the 

AEC so far (Election Guide, PSA&#39;s etc.). Itd also be useful if AEC could give any updates/or information 

regarding potential threats/risks to the Election which we can consider for our own preparation. 

May end up only being a 30 min meeting, but its good to have a bit of extra time at the end in case we need it! 

Kind regards

Hi Julie, 

It certainly is something that I have missed! 

Understood - we may have Singapore based staff joining us but it might be ok given the advance notice. Let me 
check with them and Ill get back to you Friday/Monday. 

Kind regards

, appreciate you making those changes.

Overseas travel - What a fantastic novelty at this point!
Of course happy to work with the availability of the team, I’m conscious that we may have an election
announcement by that week, and we will do our very best from this side to keep our appointments!

Looking at week commencing 4 April, are we just working with Aus based staff? If so, can I suggest 11am on
Tuesday 5 April, for an hour via Teams?

Cheers
Julie

Hi Julie, 

All actioned - yes we are certainly open to having another prep meeting prior to the election. 

Could we aim for first week April instead? My team will be overseas for a week at the end of March so it might 
be tricky for us then. 

Kind regards

Those referrals coming from our Authorisations team will be the legal ones, and those from Social Media team
more likely those against your Terms of Use.

Would actually be great for us as AEC to catch up with you once more before the election is announced? (let’s
say this month?) Just to run through everything and make sure we’re all sorted.

Hi Julie, 

Hope you are well. 

I was going through our whitelist for Australian Government agencies using our dedicated reporting channels 
and noticed we only have two email addresses registered for the AEC: 

eiat@aec.gov.au
Your email

We discussed this almost a year ago now so I just wanted to make sure the AEC didnt have any other email 
addresses/teams that would likely be sending TikTok escalations. We will still respond to all escalations in our 
govreport inbox but its helps us address the issue more quickly if we already have confirmation as to who is 
sending the request. 

Kind regards

Subject: Electoral misinformation - 

 [SEC=OFFICIAL] 

Hi team, 

Our social media team have last night identified 
reviewing it, we’ve identified two issues: 

 from the 

TikTok account. After 

1)  7 April is not a deadline for enrolling to vote or updating your enrolment. The enrolment cutoff date has not 
yet been announced (it will be announced at the same time the election is called). This means the post could 
mislead about the deadline for enrolling to vote, potentially disenfranchising young voters.  

2)  The 

account is not authorised.  

Please let me know if we can provide any more information here. Happy to discuss further.  

Thanks and kind regards,

Social Media; EIAT
Content referral - 

 [SEC=OFFICIAL]

 which breaches TikTok’s Integrity and 

- 

- 
- 
- 

Falsely claiming that Australia’s 2010 Federal Election was won by a smaller margin than the number of 
alleged multiple votes 
Falsely claiming that dead people are enrolled to vote 
Falsely claiming that identification is not required to enrol to vote 
Falsely claiming that one specific party is engaged in widespread electoral fraud 

The video is also in breach of Section 321D of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 as it does not contain both a 
written and spoken authorisation message.  

Grateful for swift action on this, as the claims being made are very serious.

Hi team,

We’ve been made aware of a TikTok account impersonating the AEC, which breaches TikTok’s
Integrity and Authenticity policy by impersonating an entity.

Grateful if this can be swiftly addressed.

Hi team,

We’ve been referred the following video which was filmed inside a polling place without permission,
potentially identifies an AEC staff member and contains disinformation accusing the AEC of rigging the
election. We would appreciate swift action on removing this, particularly given the filming was not
permitted and includes a staff member. The video appears to breach both the Integrity and
Authenticity Policy and Privacy, Personal Data, &amp; Personally Identifiable Info Policy.

TIkTok - AEC staff being recorded without consent or awareness [SEC=OFFICIAL]

Hello team,
We have been sent the following tiktok. This video records one of our staff members without their
awareness or consent in side of a counting centre. We would ask that this be removed as it breaks
privacy rules and identifies our staff.

Grateful if this can be swiftly addressed.

Cheers,

NEWSROOM POST – STRICTLY EMBARGOED UNTIL 12.01AM AEDT 15 MARCH 2022

How Meta is Preparing for the 2022 Australian Election
By Josh Machin, Head of Public Policy for Meta Australia

● Meta has been preparing for this year’s Australian election for a long time and will be using a
comprehensive strategy to combat misinformation, election interference, and other forms of
abuse on our platforms.

● We’re expanding our third-party fact-checking program in Australia to include RMIT FactLab.
They’ll join Agence France Presse and Australian Associated Press to review and rate content.
We’ll also be providing one-off grants to all our fact-checkers to increase their capacity in the
lead up to the election.

● We’re also working with the Australian Associated Press to re-run the “Check the Facts” media
literacy campaign in three other languages - into Vietnamese, Simplified Chinese and Arabic to
extend the benefits of the campaign even further.

With the Australian Election set to take place in the coming months, Meta has been preparing for them
for a long time. We’ve been involved in more than 200 elections around the world since 2017, and we’ve
learned key lessons from each one about where to focus our teams, technologies, and investments so
they will have the greatest impact. Here are some of the ways that we’re already promoting safety and
integrity across our platforms ahead of this year’s Australian Election.

Combating Abuse, Misinformation, and Election Interference Using a Comprehensive Approach

We’ve made significant investments in safety and security, including approximately $5 billion/ $AU7
billion in 2021 alone and now have more than 40,000 people around the world working on safety and
security. These investments have allowed us to build our ability to reduce the likelihood of abuses -
including election interference, misinformation and online harms - from happening in the first place,
rather than just addressing them when they occur. For this year’s Australian election, this work will
include:

● Announcing a new Australian Fact-Checker. We know the importance of ensuring Australians
have access to reliable information about the election in Australia. Therefore, we are pleased to
announce the expansion of our third party fact checking program in Australia today. From March
21, RMIT FactLab will join Meta’s global independent fact checking program in reviewing and
rating the accuracy of content in the lead up to the 2022 Australian Election, alongside Agence
France Presse and the Australian Associated Press. We&#39;ll also be providing one-off grants to all
our fact-checkers to increase their capacity in the lead up to the election. Our fact checkers work
to reduce the spread of misinformation across Meta’s services. When they rate something as

--- Page 2 ---

false, we significantly reduce its distribution so fewer people see it. We also notify people who
try to share something rated as false and add a warning label with a link to a debunking article.
● Russell Skelton, Director of RMIT FactLab said, “We see this as a really important public service.
If we can play a role in preventing the dissemination of misinformation on social media that has
the potential to mislead or harm, then we see that as providing a really critical service.”

● We are also working with expert organisations such as First Draft to increase monitoring for
misinformation in the lead-up to the election and publish related analyses and reporting on their
website. First Draft will also be providing pre-election training for Australian journalists on how
to identify and prevent amplifying mis and dis information.

● Empowering People to Identify False News. Since we know it’s not enough to just limit or

remove harmful or misleading electoral misinformation that people see, we’re giving people
more context about a post so they can make an informed decision on what to read, trust and
share. We have invested in dedicated Australian initiatives including:

○ Working with the Australian Associated Press to launch an education and awareness
campaign comprising a series of short videos modelling how people can recognise and
avoid misinformation by taking simple steps to &#39;Check the Facts&#39;. The campaign will run
again this April and will include, for the first time, content translated in three other
languages - Vietnamese, Simplified Chinese and Arabic to extend the benefits of the
campaign even further.

○ Partnering with First Draft to develop the “Don’t be a Misinfluencer” campaign on

Facebook and Instagram to help creators and influencers to share tips for spotting false
news.

Security and election interference

● Combatting Influence Operations. We have specialised global teams to identify and take action
against threats to the election, including signs of coordinated inauthentic behaviour across our
apps. We are also coordinating with the Government&#39;s election integrity assurance taskforce and
security agencies in the lead up to the election. We’ve also improved our AI so that we can more
effectively detect and block fake accounts, which are often behind this activity.

○ Since 2017, we have removed over 150 networks around the world including ahead of
major democratic elections. We’re working to find and remove any networks of
Coordinated Inauthentic Behaviour. We’ll also share publicly what we find.
● Protecting candidates and leaders running in the Australian election. In December 2021, we
extended our Facebook Protect security program to Australia. The program has been rolled out
to those who might be at a higher risk of being targeted online, such as candidates and public
officials, encouraging them to adopt stronger account security protections. We will also be
running a Facebook security prompt to candidates and leaders to remind them to turn on two
factor authentication. We are working with the Australian Electoral Commission and political
parties to run training sessions for all candidates on our policies and tools and how to keep safe
in the lead up to the election.

Encouraging transparency around political, election and social issues ads

● Mandatory transparency for political ads. Since the 2019 Australian Federal Election, we’ve
made a series of changes for advertisers in Australia that want to run electoral, political and
social issue ads. Advertisers are now required to go through an authorisation process using
government-issued photo ID, and place a “Paid for by” disclaimers on their ads. This includes any
person creating, modifying, publishing or pausing ads that reference political figures, political
parties or elections. It also includes social issue ads that seek to influence public opinion through
discussion, debate or advocacy for or against important topics, such as civil and social rights,
crime, environmental politics, education or immigration. We launched these requirements for
social issue ads last year, before the first possible election date, to ensure it was in place for the
Australian federal election. Any political, electoral or social issue ads on Facebook and Instagram
that do not have the correct authorisation or disclaimers will be removed from the platform and
archived in a public Ad Library for seven years.

● Allowing Australians to control their experience. While political and social issue ads play an
important role in every election, people have told us they want the option to see fewer of them
in their Facebook and Instagram feeds. Last year, we announced a new feature that gives people
more control by giving them the  choice to see fewer social issues, electoral, and political ads.

Encouraging civic engagement and empowering voters

We want to do more than just prevent abuse on our platforms during elections. We also want to
empower people to participate, so for this year’s Australian elections, we’re supporting civic engagement
in a number of ways.

● Developing products on the platform to encourage people to vote. Closer to election day we
will begin running notifications at the top of Facebook’s Feed for people over 18, reminding
them to vote, while also connecting them with reliable information about the voting process. We
will also be launching Instagram Stories elections stickers to celebrate and encourage voter
engagement.

Election Day Reminder (example only)

● Informing people about the latest election communications from political parties, journalists
and the Australian Election Commission. We will release a public, Live Display on Crowdtangle
dedicated to the Australian Election. The Live Display will provide real-time coverage of the most
recent communications about the election on Facebook and Instagram.

As we get closer to the Australian election, we’ll stay vigilant to emerging threats and take additional
steps if necessary to prevent abuse on our platform while also empowering people in Australia to use
their voice by voting.

Commonwealth law
infringed/issues
Policy:

FI is likely to be a break of
platforms’ own terms of use

Operational:

Division 92, Part 5.2
Criminal Code Act 1995

Detection and attribution can
be time and resource
intensive, while
disinformation strategies are
cheap and agile.

Scenari
o

Description
Foreign
interference

This scenario
notes the
difference
between the
legislated and
policy definitions
of “foreign
interference”, and
the differing
approaches taken
by policy agencies
(CFICC), and
operational
agencies/bodies
(including the CFI
Taskforce).

Examples
Policy:

Social media accounts
that appear to:

● amplify, then

consistently promote
divisive political
positions designed to
fragment the
electorate,
● target specific

demographics within
the electorate with
messaging designed to
influence voting
behaviour.

Operational:

To be actionable under
s92, FI activity must meet
the elements specified in
s92, notably: 1. Conduct;
2. done on half
of/directed by a Foreign
Principal; 3. to achieve
one of the four stated
intentions; 4. done
covertly/deceptively/wit
h menace/etc

6

Electoral
communication
containing threats
of terrorist action

Electoral communication
threatening terrorist
action against polling
booths and/or voters.

Anti-terrorism laws and
powers activated.

voting

Description
Anonymous
electoral
communication
(other than a paid
advertisement)
without
authorisation

Commonwealth law
infringed/issues
Depends on who is
communicating the matter
as to whether the
communication must be
authorised under the
Commonwealth Electoral
Act 1918.  An electoral
communication must be
authorised if it is for, or on
behalf of, a disclosure entit
(i.e. a candidate, political
party or other person or
group that is required to
report electoral
expenditure or donations t
the Electoral Commission
under Part XX of the
Electoral Act).

8

Electoral
communication
(including a paid
electoral ad) that
is defamatory

Third party authorises a
paid advertisement that
defames a candidate so
as to affect public
perception of the
integrity of the
candidate, party, election
or political system.

Affected individual or
organisation can take legal
action, however, issue may
be to stop the spread of
disinformation during an
election campaign.

may meet the threshold of
cyberbullying or adult cyber
abuse in the Online Safety
Act 2021 and be subject to
removal notices issued by
the eSafety Commissioner.

Any other
electoral
communication
that may not
breach a
Commonwealth
law, but which
may breach

the consequence of
voting informally.

Other communications not
covered by scenarios 7-9,
where no Commonwealth

Meta is Preparing for the 2022 Australian Election\nBy Josh Machin, Head of Public Policy for Meta Australia\n\n\u25cf Meta has been preparing for this year\u2019s Australian election for a long time and will be using a\ncomprehensive strategy to combat misinformation, election interference, and other forms of\nabuse on our platforms.\n\n\u25cf We\u2019re expanding our third-party fact-checking program in Australia to include RMIT FactLab.\nThey\u2019ll join Agence France Presse and Australian Associated Press to review and rate content.\nWe\u2019ll also be providing one-off grants to all our fact-checkers to increase their capacity in the\nlead up to the election.\n\n\u25cf We\u2019re also working with the Australian Associated Press to re-run the \u201cCheck the Facts\u201d media\nliteracy campaign in three other languages - into Vietnamese, Simplified Chinese and Arabic to\nextend the benefits of the campaign even further.\n\nWith the Australian Election set to take place in the coming months, Meta has been preparing for them\nfor a long time. We\u2019ve been involved in more than 200 elections around the world since 2017, and we\u2019ve\nlearned key lessons from each one about where to focus our teams, technologies, and investments so\nthey will have the greatest impact. Here are some of the ways that we\u2019re already promoting safety and\nintegrity across our platforms ahead of this year\u2019s Australian Election.\n\nCombating Abuse, Misinformation, and Election Interference Using a Comprehensive Approach\n\nWe\u2019ve made significant investments in safety and security, including approximately $5 billion/ $AU7\nbillion in 2021 alone and now have more than 40,000 people around the world working on safety and\nsecurity. These investments have allowed us to build our ability to reduce the likelihood of abuses -\nincluding election interference, misinformation and online harms - from happening in the first place,\nrather than just addressing them when they occur. For this year\u2019s Australian election, this work will\ninclude:\n\n\u25cf Announcing a new Australian Fact-Checker. We know the importance of ensuring Australians\nhave access to reliable information about the election in Australia. Therefore, we are pleased to\nannounce the expansion of our third party fact checking program in Australia today. From March\n21, RMIT FactLab will join Meta\u2019s global independent fact checking program in reviewing and\nrating the accuracy of content in the lead up to the 2022 Australian Election, alongside Agence\nFrance Presse and the Australian Associated Press. We'll also be providing one-off grants to all\nour fact-checkers to increase their capacity in the lead up to the election. Our fact checkers work\nto reduce the spread of misinformation across Meta\u2019s services. When they rate something as\n\nReleased under the FOI ActReleased under the FOI Act\n\n\n--- Page 2 ---\n\nfalse, we significantly reduce its distribution so fewer people see it. We also notify people who\ntry to share something rated as false and add a warning label with a link to a debunking article.\n\u25cf Russell Skelton, Director of RMIT FactLab said, \u201cWe see this as a really important public service.\nIf we can play a role in preventing the dissemination of misinformation on social media that has\nthe potential to mislead or harm, then we see that as providing a really critical service.\u201d\n\n\u25cf We are also working with expert organisations such as First Draft to increase monitoring for\nmisinformation in the lead-up to the election and publish related analyses and reporting on their\nwebsite. First Draft will also be providing pre-election training for Australian journalists on how\nto identify and prevent amplifying mis and dis information.\n\n\u25cf Empowering People to Identify False News. Since we know it\u2019s not enough to just limit or\n\nremove harmful or misleading electoral misinformation that people see, we\u2019re giving people\nmore context about a post so they can make an informed decision on what to read, trust and\nshare. We have invested in dedicated Australian initiatives including:\n\n\u25cb Working with the Australian Associated Press to launch an education and awareness\ncampaign comprising a series of short videos modelling how people can recognise and\navoid misinformation by taking simple steps to 'Check the Facts'. The campaign will run\nagain this April and will include, for the first time, content translated in three other\nlanguages - Vietnamese, Simplified Chinese and Arabic to extend the benefits of the\ncampaign even further.\n\n\u25cb Partnering with First Draft to develop the \u201cDon\u2019t be a Misinfluencer\u201d campaign on\n\nFacebook and Instagram to help creators and influencers to share tips for spotting false\nnews.\n\nSecurity and election interference\n\n\u25cf Combatting Influence Operations. We have specialised global teams to identify and take action\nagainst threats to the election, including signs of coordinated inauthentic behaviour across our\napps. We are also coordinating with the Government's election integrity assurance taskforce and\nsecurity agencies in the lead up to the election. We\u2019ve also improved our AI so that we can more\neffectively detect and block fake accounts, which are often behind this activity.\n\n\u25cb Since 2017, we have removed over 150 networks around the world including ahead of\nmajor democratic elections. We\u2019re working to find and remove any networks of\nCoordinated Inauthentic Behaviour. We\u2019ll also share publicly what we find.\n\u25cf Protecting candidates and leaders running in the Australian election. In December 2021, we\nextended our Facebook Protect security program to Australia. The program has been rolled out\nto those who might be at a higher risk of being targeted online, such as candidates and public\nofficials, encouraging them to adopt stronger account security protections. We will also be\nrunning a Facebook security prompt to candidates and leaders to remind them to turn on two\nfactor authentication. We are working with the Australian Electoral Commission and political\nparties to run training sessions for all candidates on our policies and tools and how to keep safe\nin the lead up to the election.\n\nReleased under the FOI ActReleased under the FOI Act\n\n\n--- Page 3 ---\n\nEncouraging transparency around political, election and social issues ads\n\n\u25cf Mandatory transparency for political ads. Since the 2019 Australian Federal Election, we\u2019ve\nmade a series of changes for advertisers in Australia that want to run electoral, political and\nsocial issue ads. Advertisers are now required to go through an authorisation process using\ngovernment-issued photo ID, and place a \u201cPaid for by\u201d disclaimers on their ads. This includes any\nperson creating, modifying, publishing or pausing ads that reference political figures, political\nparties or elections. It also includes social issue ads that seek to influence public opinion through\ndiscussion, debate or advocacy for or against important topics, such as civil and social rights,\ncrime, environmental politics, education or immigration. We launched these requirements for\nsocial issue ads last year, before the first possible election date, to ensure it was in place for the\nAustralian federal election. Any political, electoral or social issue ads on Facebook and Instagram\nthat do not have the correct authorisation or disclaimers will be removed from the platform and\narchived in a public Ad Library for seven years.\n\n\u25cf Allowing Australians to control their experience. While political and social issue ads play an\nimportant role in every election, people have told us they want the option to see fewer of them\nin their Facebook and Instagram feeds. Last year, we announced a new feature that gives people\nmore control by giving them the  choice to see fewer social issues, electoral, and political ads.\n\nEncouraging civic engagement and empowering voters\n\nWe want to do more than just prevent abuse on our platforms during elections. We also want to\nempower people to participate, so for this year\u2019s Australian elections, we\u2019re supporting civic engagement\nin a number of ways.\n\n\u25cf Developing products on the platform to encourage people to vote. Closer to election day we\nwill begin running notifications at the top of Facebook\u2019s Feed for people over 18, reminding\nthem to vote, while also connecting them with reliable information about the voting process. We\nwill also be launching Instagram Stories elections stickers to celebrate and encourage voter\nengagement.\n\nReleased under the FOI ActReleased under the FOI Act\n\n\n--- Page 4 ---\n\nElection Day Reminder (example only)\n\n\u25cf Informing people about the latest election communications from political parties, journalists\nand the Australian Election Commission. We will release a public, Live Display on Crowdtangle\ndedicated to the Australian Election. The Live Display will provide real-time coverage of the most\nrecent communications about the election on Facebook and Instagram.\n\nAs we get closer to the Australian election, we\u2019ll stay vigilant to emerging threats and take additional\nsteps if necessary to prevent abuse on our platform while also empowering people in Australia to use\ntheir voice by voting.\n\n++++\n\nAbout RMIT\n\nReleased under the FOI ActReleased under the FOI Act\n\n\n--- Page 5 ---\n\nRMIT FactLab is a research hub at RMIT University dedicated to debunking misinformation online and\ndeveloping critical awareness about its origins and spread.

These companies include US technology firms such as Meta (Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp), Twitter, Google, Telegram, and LinkedIn, as well as Chinese technology company ByteDance (TikTok). The request specifically covered correspondence created between 28/1/2022 to the date of the request.\n\n### Documents from the FOI Request\n\nThe released documents consist primarily of:\n\n*   **Schedules of Released Documents:** Detailed lists of individual documents (emails, letters, agendas, reports) with dates and descriptions.\n*   **Electoral Communications Escalation Scenarios:** A document dated 29 October 2021 (with an updated version by Google on 7 April 2022) outlining 11 scenarios of electoral communications that could infringe Commonwealth law or platform policy.\n*   **Emails and Letters:** Extensive correspondence between the AEC and:\n    *   **Microsoft:** Emails and letters related to \"Electoral Integrity Assurance Taskforce\" meetings and content referrals.\n    *   **Google (including YouTube):** Numerous emails regarding content referrals, election integrity briefings, and \"Your Request to Google\" messages for content review and removal.\n    *   **TikTok:** Emails concerning content referrals, escalation processes, and updates regarding election content.\n    *   **Twitter:** A large volume of emails related to content referrals concerning election integrity and civic-related content.\n    *   **Meta (Facebook/Instagram):** Emails regarding content requests, post-election wrap-ups, and a detailed document outlining Meta's preparations for the 2022 Australian Election.\n*   **Meeting Agendas:** Agendas for meetings between the AEC's Electoral Integrity Assurance Taskforce (EIAT) and representatives from Microsoft, Google, TikTok, Twitter, and Meta.\n*   **Reports/Briefings:** An undated document titled \"How Meta is Preparing for the 2022 Australian Election.\"\n\nWhile Telegram and LinkedIn were mentioned in the FOI request, no specific documents pertaining to these companies were listed in the released schedule.\n\n### Main Content from the FOI Request Documents\n\nThe documents reveal the AEC's proactive engagement with major tech companies to safeguard the integrity of the 2022 Australian federal election, primarily focusing on combating misinformation, disinformation, and non-compliant electoral communications.\n\n**Key Themes and Content:**\n\n1.  **Electoral Communications Escalation Scenarios:** This foundational document served as a guide for identifying and escalating problematic content. It details scenarios ranging from:\n    *   Unauthorised paid electoral advertisements (Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918, s 321D).\n    *   Misleading voters on how to cast their votes (s 329).\n    *   Impersonation of Commonwealth officials or entities.\n    *   Communications by foreign entities.\n    *   Foreign interference and threats of terrorist action.\n    *   Anonymous electoral communications.\n    *   Defamatory content or content bringing a Commonwealth agency into disrepute.\n    *   Hate speech.\n    *   Other communications that breach platform policies (e.g., spam, false news).\n\n2.  **Collaboration and Communication Channels:** The correspondence highlights the establishment and use of direct communication channels between the AEC's Electoral Integrity Assurance Taskforce (EIAT), Authorisation Section, and Social Media teams with the tech companies. This includes dedicated email addresses for content referrals and regular meetings to discuss election preparedness, integrity measures, and emerging threats.\n\n3.  **Content Referrals and Moderation:** A significant portion of the correspondence involves the AEC referring specific content for review and potential removal by the platforms. Examples of content referred include:\n    *   **Google (YouTube):** Videos containing unauthorised electoral matter (breaching s 321D CEA), privacy violations (e.g., recording without consent under Queensland law), and electoral disinformation (e.g., claims of election fraud). Google/YouTube's responses show content being blocked or removed for violating community guidelines, or in some cases, not meeting their legal policies for removal.\n    *   **TikTok:** Posts misleading about voter enrolment deadlines, videos making false claims about election fraud and lack of authorisation, accounts impersonating the AEC, and videos filmed inside polling places without permission or recording AEC staff without consent. TikTok's responses consistently indicate content or accounts were reviewed and removed for violating their community guidelines.\n    *   **Twitter:** Numerous instances of the AEC flagging tweets related to \"election integrity and/or civic-related content\" and \"electoral misinformation.\" The specific actions taken by Twitter on these flagged items are often noted as \"we have an answer about...\" or involve requests for more information.\n    *   **Meta:** Referrals for Facebook posts regarding electorates and other content requests. The nature of these specific content breaches is less detailed in the provided schedule descriptions, but Meta confirms receipt of these requests.\n\n4.  **Platform-Specific Election Integrity Initiatives:** Documents also detail the tech companies' own efforts to ensure election integrity:\n    *   **Meta:** Expanded third-party fact-checking (e.g., RMIT FactLab joining AFP, AAP), public awareness campaigns (e.g., \"Check the Facts\" in multiple languages), efforts to combat coordinated inauthentic behaviour, security programs (Facebook Protect for candidates), mandatory transparency for political ads (\"Paid for by\" disclaimers, Ad Library), and civic engagement features (voter reminders, Instagram stickers).\n    *   **Google:** Election integrity briefings, and guidance on how to flag issues on their platforms (Search, Ads, YouTube).\n\nIn summary, the documents illustrate a collaborative effort between the AEC and major social media platforms to identify, monitor, and address electoral misinformation, non-compliance with Australian electoral law, and other integrity threats during the 2022 federal election, primarily through established communication channels and content moderation processes.", "model": "gemini-2.5-flash", "generated_at": "2025-06-22T14:08:39.655121", "source_hash": "c4b0aacd4b6c488b98a60cd6fdc166b61dc3dcac050686294ba1e71e3943af1a", "raw_response_path": "data/llm_responses/LEX3037__overall__balanced__20250622T140839.json", "output_tokens": 1303, "prompt_tokens": 25550, "total_tokens": 28989, "summary_length": 6529}, "short_index": {"text": "An FOI request (LEX3037) revealed correspondence from early 2022 between the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) and major tech companies, including Meta, Twitter, Google, Microsoft, and TikTok, regarding compliance with electoral law and the 2022 federal election.

This interaction centers on identifying and responding to various forms of problematic online content, ranging from electoral misinformation to potential foreign interference.\n\n**Corporate Influence & Wealth Distribution:**\nThe documents reveal a significant reliance by the AEC on large, for-profit global technology companies to maintain electoral integrity online. The \"Electoral Integrity Assurance Taskforce\" and its consistent engagement with these tech giants highlight a model where essential democratic functions \u2013 policing disinformation, managing communication, and enforcing electoral law online \u2013 are largely outsourced to private entities. This aligns with a progressive critique regarding the undue influence of powerful corporations over public infrastructure and democratic processes. While these companies commit resources (e.g., Meta's stated $5-7 billion investment in safety/security), the fundamental power asymmetry is clear: public institutions are dependent on the willingness and operational decisions of private corporations, whose primary obligation is to shareholders. This central role of tech companies in mediating national discourse underscores concerns about wealth concentration and the privatization of public goods, where profits are privatized but societal risks, like disinformation, are broadly socialized.\n\n**Social Justice:**\nFrom a social justice perspective, the AEC's efforts, supported by these platforms, to combat misinformation and unauthorized electoral communications are broadly aligned with ensuring a fair and informed democratic process, a cornerstone of social justice. The detection and removal of content designed to mislead voters on how to cast votes (Scenario 2), impersonate officials (Scenario 3), or contain hate speech (Scenario 10) directly contribute to a more equitable and safe electoral environment. Meta's initiative to translate its \"Check the Facts\" media literacy campaign into Vietnamese, Simplified Chinese, and Arabic is a notable positive step, promoting linguistic diversity and ensuring broader access to accurate information for non-English speaking communities. However, the reactive nature of many content moderation efforts, relying on reports and post-publication removal, may be insufficient to proactively protect marginalized groups from targeted disinformation campaigns.\n\n**Civil Liberties:**\nThe documents highlight a delicate balance between safeguarding electoral integrity and upholding civil liberties, particularly freedom of expression. The AEC's focus on transparency in political advertising (requiring authorization, combating anonymous communications) generally aligns with progressive values by promoting accountability and informed voter choice. However, scenarios like \"electoral communication\u2026brings a Commonwealth agency into disrepute\" (Scenario 9) raise concerns. From a left-leaning perspective, such a broad category could potentially be used to stifle legitimate criticism or dissent against government bodies, blurring the line between protecting democratic institutions and suppressing free speech. Furthermore, the power of tech platforms to remove content based on their internal \"Platform policy\" even when no Commonwealth law is breached (Scenario 11) indicates a significant, non-democratically accountable power to regulate public discourse, which could inadvertently lead to censorship or limit diverse viewpoints. Conversely, instances where Google declined removal requests because content didn't breach *legal policies* (though it might violate platform terms) suggest a degree of adherence to legal frameworks over blanket censorship.\n\n**Environmental Impact:**\nDirect mentions of environmental impact are absent from these documents, as their scope is strictly electoral integrity. However, Meta's \"social issue ads\" policy, which includes \"environmental politics\" as an area requiring transparency, suggests a superficial alignment with environmental transparency efforts by requiring disclosure for related political advertisements. This is not an assessment of environmental impact itself, but rather a regulatory framework around communication on the topic.\n\nIn summary, while the government's actions, through the AEC, align with progressive values in seeking to protect democratic integrity, ensure transparency in political communication, and combat harmful speech, the profound reliance on opaque, for-profit corporate entities to achieve these goals represents a significant deviation. This dependency raises concerns about corporate influence, the ultimate accountability of content moderation decisions, and the potential for a chilling effect on civil liberties, highlighting a need for stronger public governance and oversight of digital information spaces.", "model": "gemini-2.5-flash", "generated_at": "2025-06-22T14:09:11.758875", "source_hash": "c4b0aacd4b6c488b98a60cd6fdc166b61dc3dcac050686294ba1e71e3943af1a", "raw_response_path": "data/llm_responses/LEX3037__overall__left_leaning__20250622T140911.json", "output_tokens": 835, "prompt_tokens": 25541, "total_tokens": 29158, "summary_length": 5025}, "short_index": {"text": "The Australian Electoral Commission's significant reliance on private technology giants like Google and Meta for 2022 election integrity represents a concerning privatization of core democratic functions.

While efforts to combat misinformation and enhance multi-lingual access align with social justice goals, the non-democratically accountable power of these platforms to regulate online discourse, including potentially stifling legitimate criticism of government agencies or removing content based on internal policies rather than law, poses a serious threat to civil liberties and freedom of expression.

From a politically right-leaning analytical perspective, this interaction raises significant concerns regarding adherence to conservative principles, particularly individual liberty, limited government, and economic efficiency, while also noting aspects related to national security.\n\n**Individual Liberty (Freedom of Speech):** The documents demonstrate a proactive approach by the AEC to monitor and influence content on private digital platforms. The \"Electoral Communications escalations scenarios\" document outlines various categories for intervention, including \"electoral communication that misleads voters\" (Scenario 2), \"impersonates a Commonwealth official\" (Scenario 3), or \"brings a Commonwealth agency into disrepute\" (Scenario 9). Most concerning is Scenario 11, which permits escalation for \"any other electoral communication that may not breach a Commonwealth law, but which may breach Platform policy.\" This last point signifies a deviation from conservative principles of free speech, suggesting a government-backed effort to manage the information environment by leveraging private companies' terms of service, effectively creating a form of censorship by proxy. Repeated emails show the AEC flagging content for removal, often successfully, for reasons ranging from \"unauthorised\" electoral matter to \"electoral misinformation,\" and even for \"recording AEC staff without consent.\" While combating genuine fraud or illegal impersonation aligns with public order, the broad scope of \"misinformation\" and \"bringing agency into disrepute\" opens the door to suppressing legitimate, albeit critical or unpopular, political expression and dissenting views. The focus on \"fact-checking\" that leads to \"significantly reduc[ed] distribution\" of content, as mentioned in Meta's preparatory document, further points to a managed discourse rather than a truly free exchange of ideas.\n\n**Limited Government:** The establishment and active operation of the \"Electoral Integrity Assurance Taskforce\" (EIAT) and its regular engagement with major tech companies represents a considerable expansion of government influence into the digital public square. This level of intervention goes beyond the traditional role of a limited government, as it involves an administrative body actively monitoring, flagging, and requesting the removal of content from private platforms, even when no explicit Commonwealth law is broken. Such collaboration blurs the lines between governmental authority and private corporate action, potentially deputizing tech companies as de facto enforcers of the government's preferred narrative. This overreach risks creating a precedent where government agencies can pressure private entities to restrict speech that is not illegal but deemed undesirable by the state.\n\n**National Security (Foreign Interference):** The documents do show alignment with conservative principles regarding national security by addressing foreign influence and interference (Scenarios 4 and 5). The concern about \"electoral communication made by or on behalf of foreign person or entity that is registrable under the Foreign Influence Transparency Scheme Act 2018 (FITS Act)\" and other forms of \"foreign interference\" reflects a legitimate interest in protecting national sovereignty. However, the \"policy\" definition of foreign interference, which includes promoting \"divisive political positions designed to fragment the electorate\" (Scenario 5), could be interpreted broadly, potentially sweeping in legitimate domestic political debate that is simply deemed \"divisive\" by government agencies. A conservative perspective would advocate for clear distinctions between genuine foreign espionage/meddling and domestic political discourse, even if robust or contentious.\n\n**Economic Efficiency & Fiscal Responsibility:** While the documents do not provide specific cost figures, the existence of a dedicated \"Electoral Integrity Assurance Taskforce,\" its regular meetings, and the volume of correspondence exchanged with multiple large tech companies imply a significant allocation of taxpayer resources (staff time, administrative overhead). From a fiscal responsibility standpoint, a right-leaning analysis would question whether such extensive government machinery dedicated to digital content policing is the most efficient and fiscally prudent use of public funds, especially when considering the potential impact on individual liberties.\n\nIn summary, while aspects of national security (countering foreign interference) align with conservative concerns, the overwhelming impression from these documents is one of government expansion and overreach into the digital speech domain. The extensive collaboration with tech companies for content moderation, particularly for content that does not violate Australian law but merely platform policy, represents a significant deviation from the core conservative principles of limited government and robust individual liberty, raising concerns about a managed public discourse rather than a truly free and open one.", "model": "gemini-2.5-flash", "generated_at": "2025-06-22T14:09:37.081991", "source_hash": "c4b0aacd4b6c488b98a60cd6fdc166b61dc3dcac050686294ba1e71e3943af1a", "raw_response_path": "data/llm_responses/LEX3037__overall__right_leaning__20250622T140937.json", "output_tokens": 904, "prompt_tokens": 25541, "total_tokens": 28300, "summary_length": 5296}, "short_index": {"text": "These FOI documents, from a right-leaning perspective, reveal an alarming expansion of government overreach by the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) into digital speech, fundamentally challenging individual liberty and limited government principles.

Far from merely enforcing Australian law, the documents reveal a proactive and arguably overreaching strategy by a government body to influence and control online discourse, often relying on the subjective \"terms of service\" of private corporations rather than the Commonwealth Electoral Act itself.\n\nKey observations from a skeptical perspective:\n\n*   **Delegated Censorship and Overreach:** The \"Electoral Communications Escalation Scenarios\" document (updated by Google, notably) explicitly includes \"Scenario 11: Any other electoral communication that may not breach a Commonwealth law, but which may breach Platform policy.\" This is a critical admission: the AEC actively requests the removal of content *that is not illegal under Australian law*, instead leveraging the private, opaque, and often inconsistently applied \"community guidelines\" of tech platforms. This allows the government to bypass due process and legal scrutiny, effectively outsourcing censorship to unaccountable private entities.\n*   **Corporate Influence on Government Policy:** The fact that the \"Electoral Communications Escalation Scenarios\" document was \"Updated by Google on 7 April 2022\" is highly problematic. It suggests that a foreign private corporation is directly influencing or co-authoring the operational guidelines for an Australian government body concerning electoral communications. This blurs the lines of sovereignty and raises serious questions about undue corporate influence on public administration and democratic processes.\n*   **Lack of Transparency and Accountability:** The vast majority of the \"released documents\" are merely a schedule of correspondence, providing little to no insight into the actual content of the flagged material or the detailed justification for its referral. The numerous generic \"Your Request has been received\" and \"Content has been removed\" emails from tech companies offer minimal transparency, making it impossible for the public to scrutinize what content was targeted, why, or whether removals were justified. This opaque process undermines public trust in both government and tech platforms.\n*   **Ambiguous Justifications for Removal:** While some referrals relate to clear legal violations (e.g., impersonation of AEC officials), many are vaguely defined, such as \"electoral misinformation\" or \"disinformation.\" For instance, a TikTok video accusing the AEC of \"rigging the election\" was removed. While such claims might be false, their removal by government-prompted corporate action raises concerns about suppressing critical, albeit erroneous, public discourse rather than engaging with it transparently. The removal of a video \"filmed inside a polling place without permission, potentially identifies an AEC staff member\" also suggests a move to control public documentation of electoral processes, potentially hindering transparency and public scrutiny.\n*   **Resource Allocation and Inefficiency:** The sheer volume of individual email referrals between the AEC and various platforms, often for minor or recurring issues (e.g., lack of proper authorisation on content), indicates a significant allocation of government resources to content policing. This manual, reactive approach raises questions about the efficient use of taxpayer money and whether such extensive surveillance and intervention in online speech is a primary or appropriate function for an electoral commission.\n\nIn essence, these documents reveal an electoral body deeply entangled with private tech companies, not merely to enforce laws, but to actively manage and suppress online speech based on the platforms' own, often arbitrary, rules.

This engagement focused on critical areas such as:\n\n*   **Combating Misinformation and Disinformation:** The AEC actively referred instances of electoral misinformation and content likely to mislead voters on how to cast their votes. Tech companies responded swiftly, with documents showing successful content removals and blocking of videos that violated electoral laws or platform policies.\n*   **Ensuring Transparency and Authorisation:** The government emphasised the necessity of proper authorisation for electoral communications, as mandated by the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918. This ensured voters were aware of the source of political messaging, promoting accountability.\n*   **Protecting Against Impersonation:** Swift action was taken to address instances of entities impersonating the AEC, with tech platforms promptly removing such deceptive accounts or content, thereby safeguarding public trust in official information sources.\n*   **Upholding Privacy and Safety:** Concerns regarding the unauthorised recording of AEC staff in polling places were immediately addressed, demonstrating the government's commitment to protecting the privacy and safety of those administering the election.\n*   **Proactive Security Measures:** Beyond reactive content moderation, the documents reveal Meta's comprehensive preparations, including expanding fact-checking programs, launching media literacy campaigns, combating influence operations, and offering security programs like \"Facebook Protect\" to candidates. Similarly, Google provided resources like its \"Civics Training Centre\" and political advertising transparency reports, empowering participants and the public.\n\nThe numerous emails detailing content referrals and subsequent removals by the tech companies underscore the effectiveness of these collaborations.

Abdication of Sovereignty and Legislative Failure:**\nThe documents reveal a shocking reliance on the \"community guidelines\" and internal \"legal policies\" of foreign tech giants like Google, Meta, and TikTok, rather than robust Australian law. The AEC's own \"Electoral Communications Escalation Scenarios\" document explicitly admits a critical legal vacuum, noting that some issues \"may not breach a Commonwealth law, but which may breach Platform policy.\" This is a catastrophic confession of legislative negligence, leaving fundamental aspects of Australian electoral integrity to the arbitrary whims of corporate terms of service. In one damning instance, the YouTube Legal Support Team flatly rejected an AEC request to restrict content, stating, \"we didn't find grounds to restrict the URL(s) at issue under our legal policies,\" despite the AEC citing potential breaches of both Queensland privacy law and the Commonwealth Electoral Act. The AEC was then advised to \"try to resolve any issues directly with the creator of the content\" or \"pursue legal action,\" exposing the AEC as utterly toothless in directly enforcing Australian law.\n\n**2. Reactive and Overwhelmed Response to Pervasive Misinformation:**\nThe sheer volume of content referral emails, particularly with Twitter and Meta, indicates an electoral environment plagued by widespread \"misinformation,\" \"disinformation,\" \"impersonation,\" and \"unauthorised communications.\" The AEC functions merely as a reactive reporting service, submitting a relentless stream of \"requests\" and \"referrals\" into corporate black boxes. This reactive approach, where the AEC must wait for platforms to \"review\" or \"complete\" actions, guarantees that harmful, misleading, or illegal content remains visible and influences voters during critical election periods. The constant \"Your Request... has been received\" emails highlight a process of passive submission rather than authoritative demand.\n\n**3. Direct Admission of Vulnerability to Foreign Interference:**\nThe AEC's own \"Electoral Communications Escalation Scenarios\" document contains a staggering admission: \"Detection and attribution [of foreign interference] can be time and resource intensive, while disinformation strategies are cheap and agile.\" This is a public confession of the Australian government's severe incapacity and under-resourcing to effectively combat sophisticated, potentially state-sponsored, attacks on its democratic process. It suggests a known vulnerability that was not adequately addressed.\n\n**4. Foreign Corporations Dictating Terms and Strategy:**\nThe humiliating extent of the AEC's subservience is starkly evident in documents like the \"Electoral Communications Escalation Scenarios\" explicitly stating \"Updated by Google,\" demonstrating that foreign corporations are directly shaping the frameworks intended to protect Australian elections. Furthermore, Meta's \"How Meta is Preparing for the 2022 Australian Election\" is presented as a released document, yet it is merely a corporate public relations piece outlining Meta's unilateral actions and significant internal investments. This underscores Meta's self-appointed role as an independent arbiter of Australian elections, without apparent direct control or directive from the AEC.\n\n**5. Repeated Failures in Content Integrity:**\nThe documents detail a litany of severe electoral malfeasance requiring external intervention:\n*   False claims of widespread election fraud, including \"dead people are enrolled to vote\" and \"identification is not required to enrol to vote,\" being disseminated on platforms like TikTok.\n*   Direct impersonation of the AEC itself on TikTok.\n*   Illicit filming inside polling places and counting centres, including AEC staff without consent, coupled with \"disinformation accusing the AEC of rigging the election.\"\n*   Unauthorised electoral advertising and communications, a direct breach of the Commonwealth Electoral Act, requiring AEC to report to platforms.\nThe sheer frequency and gravity of these incidents reveal a profound breakdown in information integrity during the election, with the AEC relegated to merely flagging issues for companies to address on their own terms.\n\n**6. Critical Omission in FOI Release:**\nDespite the explicit request for \"all correspondence... between the Australian Election Commission and... Telegram,\" no documents relating to Telegram were released.
