      <h2>Summary of FOI Request Documents (LEX3070)</h2>
<h3>Main Purpose of the FOI Request</h3>
<p>The main purpose of the Freedom of Information (FOI) request (LEX3070) was to obtain "all applications made to the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) under s 141 (2) of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 during the year 2022 prior to 21st June 2022." Section 141(2) of the Act pertains to requests for review of decisions made by the Electoral Commission, typically concerning the registration or deregistration of political parties.</p>
<h3>Documents from the FOI Request</h3>
<p>The released documents include:</p>
<ul>
<li>A "Schedule of Published Documents" outlining nine items related to the FOI request.</li>
<li>Various communications, primarily emails and letters, from political parties or individuals to the AEC. These communications mostly constitute formal requests for review of AEC decisions under s 141(2) or related objections.</li>
<li>One detailed statistical analysis report, "AEC Party Membership Test Methodology is Rigged! A Statistical Analysis of AEC Methodology and Graphs (of PMFs)," submitted as part of a review request by the Flux party.</li>
<li>Standard redaction codes outlining reasons for information withholding (e.g., personal information, business information, legal professional communication).</li>
</ul>
<h3>Main Content from FOI Request Documents</h3>
<p>The core content of the released documents revolves around challenges to the Australian Electoral Commission's decisions regarding party registration and deregistration, primarily focusing on the methodology for assessing party membership.</p>
<p><strong>1. Challenges to AEC's Membership Testing Methodology (Common Theme):</strong></p>
<p>Several parties, including the <strong>Democratic Labour Party (DLP)</strong>, <strong>VOTEFLUX.ORG | Upgrade Democracy! (Flux)</strong>, and the <strong>Health Australia Party (HAP)</strong>, submitted requests for review of their deregistration, predominantly arguing that the AEC's statistical methodology for verifying party membership is flawed and unfair.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Arguments raised by DLP, Flux, and HAP:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Statistical Validity:</strong> They contend that the AEC's sampling method (e.g., testing only a small sample of members) is unreliable and does not definitively prove a party's membership numbers. Flux provided extensive statistical analysis by Max Kaye, arguing that the methodology has a high "false negative" rate (over 99.99% for Flux in a hypothetical scenario where it met the membership threshold) and that its outcomes are "predetermined" and "rigged."</li>
<li><strong>Membership List Limits:</strong> Parties criticized the AEC's policy of limiting the number of members a party can submit for verification (e.g., 1650 members), arguing it prevents them from demonstrating their true membership numbers (e.g., Flux claimed 4,680 members, HAP claimed 3,000-4,000 members). They argue this policy is not legislated and unduly disadvantages parties.</li>
<li><strong>Procedural Fairness:</strong> Claims of denial of natural justice were made, including:<ul>
<li>AEC ignoring requests to submit additional member lists while allegedly permitting other parties to do so without explicit permission (DLP).</li>
<li>AEC's selective sampling (e.g., Flux alleged the AEC sampled only from the top 1,650 names alphabetically, excluding many members).</li>
<li>Denial of access to comprehensive electoral roll databases (ELIAS) for parties to accurately prune their member lists (HAP).</li>
<li>Allegations of "apprehended bias" against certain party types (DLP).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Consequences and Historical Context:</strong> The statistical analysis by Max Kaye further suggests that the AEC's methodology, combined with changes in electoral law (e.g., increasing required members from 500 to 1500), has "systemically disadvantaged non-parliamentary parties" and acted as a tool for "eliminating competition." It identifies several historical cases as "suspected" or "possible farces" where the AEC's testing method likely had a very low accuracy rate.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2. Suspected Clerical Error (Australian Progressives):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>Australian Progressives</strong> requested an urgent internal review of their deregistration, alleging a "clerical error" in the AEC's assessment of their membership. They noted a drastic and inexplicable drop in their membership match rate between two submitted lists (from 96% to 12%), which they believe was not justified by amendments made to the list.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3. Objection to Party Registration (David Pocock Party):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>An individual requested an internal review of the AEC's decision to <em>register</em> the <strong>David Pocock party</strong>. The objections were based on two main grounds:<ul>
<li><strong>Candidate Eligibility:</strong> David Pocock's public admission of foreign (Zimbabwean) citizenship, arguing that registering a party named after an individual ineligible for election is contrary to the Commonwealth Electoral Act's purpose and could mislead the public.</li>
<li><strong>Party Name Consistency:</strong> The name "David Pocock" was deemed inconsistent with the legal concept of a "party," which should represent a collective rather than an individual. Concerns were raised about potential confusion on ballot papers and an unfair advantage for the candidate.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>4. Objection to Party Logo (Australian Federation Party):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>An individual objected to the proposed logo for the <strong>Australian Federation Party</strong>. The concern was that a "tick" symbol within the logo could be misinterpreted by voters as a mark for the ballot box, potentially leading to invalidated votes. (Note: While included in the released documents, this is an objection to a logo under s 134(6)(c), not a s 141(2) review of a registration/deregistration decision.)</li>
</ul>
<p>In summary, the documents reveal a strong theme of challenges to the AEC's administrative processes, particularly its membership verification methodology, with parties arguing that the methods are statistically flawed, procedurally unfair, and lead to arbitrary or predetermined deregistration outcomes.</p>

    <div class="ai-summary-markdown-content">
      <p>The Freedom of Information (FOI) documents reveal a series of applications made to the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) for reviews of decisions, predominantly concerning the deregistration of political parties in 2022. From a left-leaning perspective, these documents highlight significant concerns regarding the fairness, accessibility, and integrity of Australia's democratic processes, raising red flags related to social justice, corporate influence, and civil liberties.</p>
<p><strong>Key Issues and Progressive Analysis:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Barriers to Democratic Participation and Civil Liberties:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Increased Membership Threshold and Lack of Grace Period:</strong> Multiple parties (Democratic Labour Party, Flux, Health Australia Party, Australian Progressives) are struggling with the recent increase in the minimum membership requirement from 500 to 1,500. This legislative change, implemented without a grace period, is perceived as an arbitrary barrier, disproportionately impacting smaller, non-parliamentary parties. This directly deviates from progressive values of inclusive democracy and fair participation, as it stifles new and diverse political voices, which often originate from grassroots movements.</li>
<li><strong>Flawed and Biased Membership Testing Methodology:</strong> This is the most critical issue raised. Documents from Flux and Health Australia Party, particularly Flux's extensive statistical analysis, assert that the AEC's membership verification method is "faulty," "inaccurate," "unreliable," and effectively "rigged."<ul>
<li><strong>High False-Negative Rates:</strong> The analysis demonstrates that the AEC's method frequently produces "false negatives," meaning eligible parties with sufficient members are wrongly deregistered (e.g., Flux claims a 71.7% false-negative rate for its own test, and up to 99.998% for hypothetical eligible parties). This undermines the fundamental civil liberty of free association and the right to participate in the political process via party registration.</li>
<li><strong>Arbitrary Limits and Lack of Transparency:</strong> Parties argue that the AEC's policy limiting submitted membership lists to 1,650 names, even when they possess thousands more, is unlegislated and unfair. The AEC's refusal to allow parties to replace filtered members (due to duplicates, deceased, etc.) or to grant full access to electoral roll data for list cleaning further exacerbates this. This lack of transparency and an opaque process are antithetical to progressive demands for open and accountable governance.</li>
<li><strong>Allegations of Bias:</strong> The Democratic Labour Party explicitly claims "conservative Christian parties" like theirs were "singled out for quick deregistration" while "left-leaning secular parties" allegedly remained registered, though they do not provide evidence for this specific bias, their broader critique of unfair process resonates with concerns about social justice in electoral administration.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Entrenchment of the Status Quo and Corporate Influence (Implicit):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The consistent theme across the appeals is that the AEC's policies and the recent legislative changes are serving to "cull" smaller parties and "entrench the status quo" of major parties. From a progressive viewpoint, this creates an unlevel playing field, making it harder for emergent movements, independent voices, or parties advocating for environmental protection, wealth redistribution, or other social justice reforms to gain traction. This systemic bias implicitly benefits established interests, including potentially corporate influence, by limiting political competition and the diversity of policy debates.</li>
<li>Flux explicitly notes that building and maintaining large membership lists is "expensive, time consuming, and difficult to manage," implying that smaller parties with fewer resources are at a disadvantage, unless they, like Flux, develop "significant automation" for member management, which is "too involved, expensive, and specialized for it to be practical for most political parties." This speaks to an indirect form of wealth-based exclusion in the political sphere.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Government Accountability and Trust in Institutions:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The detailed statistical critiques, particularly by Max Kaye from Flux, accuse the AEC of enforcing a "rigged" method and ignoring "reason, or logic, or statistical arguments." The AEC's dismissal of these critiques, often by citing its own internal validations, reveals a lack of responsiveness and accountability that directly contradicts progressive expectations for public institutions. The David Pocock Party objection, while different in nature, also critiques the AEC for taking an "extraordinarily narrow approach to statutory interpretation" and failing to make key factual findings, further eroding trust in the AEC's impartiality and competence.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In summary, these FOI documents paint a concerning picture from a left-leaning perspective, suggesting that government actions and electoral policies, ostensibly aimed at maintaining "electoral integrity," are in practice creating significant barriers to democratic participation, disproportionately disadvantaging smaller, non-parliamentary parties, and entrenching the power of established political elites. This represents a significant deviation from progressive values of civil liberties, social justice, and fair, transparent, and representative democracy.</p>

    <div class="ai-summary-markdown-content">
      <p>These FOI documents reveal significant concerns regarding the Australian Electoral Commission's (AEC) administration of electoral regulations, particularly in relation to party registration and deregistration processes. Analyzing these through a conservative lens, several deviations from core principles of economic efficiency, individual liberty, fiscal responsibility, and limited government are apparent.</p>
<p><strong>Economic Efficiency and Fiscal Responsibility:</strong><br />
The documents repeatedly highlight the AEC's use of a membership testing methodology that is criticized as "faulty," "inaccurate," "unreliable," and "unsuitable." The Flux party's detailed statistical analysis (Document 4, 6) strongly suggests this method leads to a high rate of "false negatives," effectively deregistering eligible parties. If a government process consistently produces incorrect outcomes, it is inherently inefficient. Parties expend significant resources to maintain membership lists and comply with regulations, only to be subjected to a "rigged" test that is described as a "farce." This represents a considerable waste of private resources and taxpayer money, as appeals and re-tests become necessary, and legitimate political organizations are forced to fight administrative incompetence rather than engaging in the democratic process. The claim that the AEC's "trivial mistakes in the documentation and execution" (Document 6) further underscores a lack of fiscal discipline and operational efficiency within the agency.</p>
<p><strong>Individual Liberty:</strong><br />
The core function of an electoral commission in a free society is to facilitate, not hinder, political participation. The documents present multiple instances where AEC actions appear to curtail individual liberty and the freedom of association.<br />
*   <strong>Arbitrary Barriers:</strong> The Democratic Labour Party (DLP) (Document 3) and Flux (Document 4, 6) both challenge the AEC's strict limit of 1650 members for validation, arguing it is "not legislated" and prevents them from demonstrating their full membership, which for some parties numbers in the thousands. This constitutes an arbitrary administrative barrier that restricts political organization and participation.<br />
*   <strong>Unequal Treatment:</strong> The DLP alleges a "singling out" of "conservative Christian parties" for quick deregistration compared to "left-leaning secular parties," suggesting a potential ideological bias that undermines the principle of equal treatment under the law and fair political competition (Document 3).<br />
*   <strong>Denial of Natural Justice:</strong> Both the DLP (Document 3) and Health Australia Party (HAP) (Document 7) claim denial of natural justice, citing restrictions on providing additional member lists or access to necessary databases (ELIAS) to verify member details. This hinders parties' ability to comply and participate, infringing on their liberty to organize effectively.</p>
<p><strong>Limited Government:</strong><br />
A foundational conservative principle is that government should be limited in scope and operate strictly within its legislative mandate. These documents raise serious questions about AEC overreach and lack of accountability.<br />
*   <strong>Bureaucratic Overreach:</strong> The claim that the AEC imposes policies, such as the 1650-member limit, that are "not legislated" (Document 7) is a direct challenge to the concept of limited government. It suggests an unelected bureaucracy is creating rules beyond the explicit will of the legislature, thereby exercising undue power.<br />
*   <strong>Lack of Accountability and Competence:</strong> The detailed statistical analysis from Flux, asserting the AEC's method "fails more than 99% of the time" for eligible parties and that the agency uses a "typo" in its testing table for years (Document 4), points to a severe lack of internal oversight and competence. The AEC's dismissal of these critiques as "irrelevant" or stating that its "own organization’s endorsement of its own process is an entirely circular justification" (Document 3) demonstrates a troubling lack of responsiveness and accountability to legitimate concerns.<br />
*   <strong>Compromising Electoral Integrity:</strong> The objections to the registration of the "David Pocock" party (Document 8) highlight a concern that the AEC adopted an "extraordinarily narrow approach to statutory interpretation" ("ticking boxes") rather than considering the broader "scheme of the legislation or its purpose." This enabled the registration of a party named after an individual publicly admitting foreign citizenship, raising concerns about the AEC's role in upholding constitutional eligibility for elected officials. Such administrative failures can indirectly compromise national integrity by allowing ineligible individuals to stand, wasting electoral resources, and undermining public trust in the democratic process.</p>
<p>In summary, these documents paint a picture of an electoral commission that, in the view of the complainants, may be operating inefficiently, infringing on individual liberties through arbitrary rules and perceived bias, and exceeding its limited governmental mandate through questionable interpretations and administrative incompetence. These issues directly contradict key conservative tenets and suggest a need for greater transparency, accountability, and adherence to foundational principles in government administration.</p>

    <div class="ai-summary-markdown-content">
      <p>The requested FOI documents reveal a concerning pattern of administrative overreach, questionable decision-making, and a striking lack of transparency within the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC), particularly regarding party registration and deregistration processes.</p>
<p>A central theme emerging from the complaints is the AEC's <strong>dubious methodology for membership validation</strong>, which is repeatedly challenged as being "rigged," "flawed," and "inaccurate." One detailed statistical analysis provided by a deregistered party (Flux) explicitly claims the AEC's testing method has a false negative rate exceeding 99% in certain scenarios, effectively predetermining outcomes for eligible parties. This analysis, reportedly ignored by the AEC, suggests an agency unwilling to engage with evidence-based critiques of its own operations.</p>
<p>Key findings highlighting waste, power abuse, and questionable decisions include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Arbitrary and Inconsistent Application of Rules:</strong> The Democratic Labour Party (DLP) alleges they were "singled out for quick deregistration" while other, "left-leaning secular parties" receiving similar notices remained registered. DLP also claims that while they were denied permission to submit additional member lists, other parties were "permitted to lodge new lists along with their statement" without explicit permission, indicating a lack of uniform and fair process.</li>
<li><strong>Flawed Statistical Sampling:</strong> Parties contend the AEC's reliance on "tiny samples" (e.g., 42 members from a list of 1650) to determine eligibility is "questionable from the standpoints of both procedural fairness and legal validity." The AEC's justification for this method is dismissed as "entirely circular justification" lacking credibility. This ineffective process wastes party resources in compliance efforts and AEC resources in conducting flawed tests and managing subsequent appeals.</li>
<li><strong>Artificial Barriers to Compliance:</strong> The AEC's policy of capping submitted membership lists at 1650 names, even when parties claim to have thousands more (e.g., Flux with 4680, Health Australia Party with ~4000), is viewed as an arbitrary limitation that actively prevents parties from demonstrating their true membership numbers. Furthermore, the Health Australia Party alleges they were "denied access to the ELIAS database for every State and Territory" to clean their membership lists, severely restricting their ability to comply.</li>
<li><strong>Dismissal of Reasoned Critique and Lack of Accountability:</strong> The AEC's response to detailed statistical challenges is characterized as dismissive, relying on self-endorsement rather than engaging with the facts. One AEC delegate's "statement of reasons" is criticized for being "dishonest" and largely "irrelevant" to the core arguments of flawed methodology. This indicates a profound lack of transparency and an unwillingness to be held accountable for potentially erroneous decisions.</li>
<li><strong>"Ticking Boxes" Mentality over Legislative Intent:</strong> In the case of the David Pocock party registration, an objector claims the AEC adopted an "extraordinarily narrow approach to statutory interpretation" and a "ticking boxes" approach. This led to the purported failure to consider a candidate's public admission of foreign citizenship (a fundamental eligibility issue) or the potential for voter confusion and "unfair advantage" if a candidate's name appears as both a party and an individual on the ballot. This suggests bureaucratic rigidity overriding the broader purpose of electoral law and potentially misleading the public.</li>
<li><strong>Evidence of Clerical Errors and Incompetence:</strong> The Australian Progressives detail a "clerical error" where their matched membership rate inexplicably dropped from 96% to 12% between two submissions, suggesting a lack of rigor or competence in AEC's internal processes. Historical analysis of AEC tables also points to instances where "typos" in testing parameters were "enforced," leading to incorrect deregistration outcomes.</li>
</ul>
<p>In summary, the documents paint a picture of an AEC whose administrative processes, particularly in regulating political parties, are perceived as arbitrary, lacking transparency, and fundamentally flawed. The rigid adherence to dubious methodologies, coupled with a dismissive attitude towards detailed critiques and apparent internal inefficiencies, raises serious questions about the AEC's integrity, its equitable treatment of all political actors, and its role in maintaining a fair and competitive democratic landscape.</p>

      <p>These FOI documents highlight the Australian Electoral Commission's (AEC) unwavering commitment to effective governance, necessary regulation, and positive outcomes in upholding Australia's democratic processes. The records showcase a robust system designed to ensure electoral integrity, maintain public trust, and manage the registration of political parties with transparency and fairness.</p>
<p>The documents reveal the AEC's proactive approach to maintaining the clarity and integrity of elections, as evidenced by its responsiveness to public feedback on issues like party logos, where even minor details are meticulously reviewed to prevent voter confusion and ensure an unblemished democratic experience. This demonstrates the government's dedication to every aspect of the electoral process.</p>
<p>A central theme is the AEC's diligent application of necessary regulations, particularly regarding the vital requirement for political parties to demonstrate a minimum membership threshold. While some parties, such as the Democratic Labour Party (DLP), Flux, and the Health Australia Party (HAP), have expressed concerns or challenged the statistical methodology used for membership verification, these documents underscore that the AEC employs a consistent, scientifically-backed approach, developed in consultation with the Australian Bureau of Statistics. This methodology is critical for ensuring that registered parties possess genuine public support, thereby streamlining the electoral landscape and reducing complexity for voters. Any challenges to this methodology are not indicative of flaws, but rather demonstrate the transparency and accountability inherent in the AEC's processes, where parties are afforded comprehensive avenues for review and appeal under the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the documents illustrate the government's commitment to procedural fairness and due process. Requests for internal reviews, as seen from the Australian Progressives and the David Pocock party's registration, are diligently considered. The AEC's willingness to re-examine specific claims, such as alleged clerical errors in membership list validation or concerns about party names' consistency with legislative intent, reflects its dedication to administrative precision and continuous improvement. The handling of these appeals reinforces that every decision is subject to scrutiny and that the AEC strives for accuracy and consistency in applying electoral law, even when dealing with complex or high-profile issues.</p>
<p>In sum, these FOI disclosures provide a clear picture of an electoral commission that is transparent, responsive, and rigorously committed to serving the public interest by ensuring a fair, orderly, and credible democratic system. The challenges and reviews documented are not setbacks but rather integral components of a robust governance framework, demonstrating the AEC's effective management of essential electoral functions for the public good.</p>

      <p>The provided FOI documents expose a deeply disturbing pattern of systemic failures, incompetence, potential bias, and a casual disregard for democratic principles within the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC). Far from upholding electoral integrity, the AEC's actions, as meticulously detailed by the aggrieved parties, suggest an agency that is either spectacularly inept, deliberately obstructive, or a willing participant in the suppression of political competition.</p>
<p><strong>A. Membership Testing: A "Rigged Farce" Built on Incompetence and Obstruction:</strong></p>
<p>The most damning revelations center on the AEC’s membership testing methodology, repeatedly lambasted as "faulty," "unreliable," "unfair," "unsuitable," and explicitly "rigged and a farce."</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Statistical Malpractice and Deliberate Failure:</strong> Max Kaye’s extensive statistical analysis (Doc 3 &amp; 5, particularly from VOTEFLUX.ORG) mathematically proves the AEC's test is designed to fail eligible parties. For a hypothetical party (like Flux, with thousands of legitimate members), the test has a near 99.998% false-negative rate, meaning it is "predetermined in its outcome" and provides "no meaningful information" on actual membership. This isn't mere error; it's a profound systemic flaw that, when combined with the AEC's continued reliance on it despite clear evidence, demonstrates either an unparalleled level of statistical illiteracy or a cynical, deliberate intent to deregister parties.</li>
<li><strong>Arbitrary Limits and Biased Sampling:</strong> The AEC's policy of limiting submitted member lists to 1,650, even when parties (like Flux with 4,680 members and HAP with ~4,000) possess far more, is identified as a primary cause of these false negatives. This artificial constraint, described as "AEC policy alone" with "no mathematical reason," actively prevents accurate assessment. Adding insult to injury, the AEC’s decision to select the <em>top 1,650 names alphabetically</em> from Flux's list (Doc 3) for testing demonstrates a breathtaking level of procedural ignorance or a malicious intent to introduce bias, effectively guaranteeing a skewed result.</li>
<li><strong>Active Obstruction and Unequal Treatment:</strong> The Democratic Labour Party (DLP, Doc 2) and Health Australia Party (HAP, Doc 6) explicitly accuse the AEC of denying natural justice and creating an uneven playing field. DLP alleges being denied the opportunity to submit additional member lists while other, implicitly favored, parties were permitted to do so. HAP was actively denied access to the full national electoral roll database (ELIAS), severely hindering its ability to clean its membership list – yet the AEC then penalizes them for issues like deceased members. This suggests a pattern of deliberately setting up smaller parties to fail by withholding necessary tools and applying inconsistent standards.</li>
<li><strong>Administrative Shambles and Gross Negligence:</strong> The Australian Progressives (Doc 9) highlight a catastrophic "clerical error" where their membership match rate plummeted from 96% to 12% between submissions. This, coupled with the "lack of a similar breakdown" in the AEC's response, points to an organization cutting corners, operating with alarming sloppiness, and fundamentally mismanaging critical data, directly jeopardizing a party's democratic participation. The historical revelation that the AEC enforced a "typo" in its own testing table for "at least 4 years" (Doc 3, appendix) without detection or correction is a damning indictment of its internal quality control and oversight.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>B. Beyond Membership: Misleading the Public and Undermining Democratic Processes:</strong></p>
<p>The AEC's failures extend beyond membership tests, revealing a broader pattern of negligence and potential complicity in undermining electoral fairness.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Enabling Ineligible Candidates and Ignoring Constitutional Risks:</strong> The objection to the "David Pocock party" (Doc 8) highlights the AEC's dangerously superficial "ticking boxes" approach to party registration. Despite public admissions of foreign citizenship from the candidate, the AEC allegedly ignored these critical eligibility concerns. This inaction is condemned as "misleading the Australian public" and directly contributing to a risk of "ineligible" persons being elected, echoing past constitutional crises caused by the AEC's "procedural failure." This demonstrates a shocking disregard for foundational constitutional requirements and the integrity of elected office.</li>
<li><strong>Lax Standards and Unfair Advantage:</strong> The same objection (Doc 8) also lambasts the AEC for allowing "David Pocock" as a party name, arguing it is inconsistent with the legal concept of a "party." This decision is portrayed as "perverse" and granting an "unfair advantage" by causing confusion on ballot papers, reinforcing the perception that the AEC is not maintaining a level playing field or even basic common sense in its registration decisions.</li>
<li><strong>Ignoring Public and Party Concerns:</strong> The email regarding the Australian Federation Party logo (Doc 1) raises concerns about a tick mark that could "invalidate the vote" or mislead voters, yet the objection notes "only five have objected," suggesting AEC's indifference to minor but valid public concerns. More broadly, the repeated accusations from Flux that the AEC "ignored our criticisms" and "does not care about reason, or logic, or statistical arguments" (Doc 3), instead offering "insanity" and "circular" justifications, paints a picture of an unresponsive and unaccountable bureaucracy.</li>
</ol>
<p>In conclusion, the documents collectively portray an AEC that is fundamentally compromised. Its procedures are demonstrably flawed, its interpretations of law are "extraordinarily narrow," and its responses to legitimate concerns are arrogant and dismissive. The repeated accusations of unfairness, incompetence, and potentially deliberate actions to disadvantage non-parliamentary parties – all while claiming "integrity, professionalism and quality" – paint a damning picture of an institution actively undermining the very democratic processes it is mandated to protect.</p>

Notice under s 134(6)(c) of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 (Electoral Act) - 
Australian Federation Party

CAUTION:This email originated from outside of the Australian Federal Government. Do not click links or open 
attachments unless you recognise the sender and know the content is safe. 

I refer to your reply to my submission on the Australian Federation Party logo.  Although only five have objected to 
the logo, we all appear to agree. 

Logos are placed next to the name or party on the  voting slip.   Voters could easily interpret the tick as the place to 
mark the box.  If a tick is actually put in the box this would invalidate the vote   Alternatively, the correct number 
could be placed in the box because the voter thought the tick indicated this was what should be done. 

I hope that this will be reconsidered.

Mr Tom Rogers 
 Australian Electoral Commissioner 
Locked Bag 4007  
Canberra City ACT 2601 

By email to: commission.secretariat@aec.gov.au 

Dear Mr Rogers 

REQUEST FOR REVIEW OF DECISION 

Pursuant to section 141(2) of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918, (the Electoral Act), we 
request a review of the decision on 4 March 2022 by the Delegate of the Commissioner, Joanne 
Reid, to deregister the Democratic Labour Party (the DLP) under section 137(6)(a) of the Act. 

In the first instance, it is of concern to us that amongst many small parties which have received 
Notices of Intent to Deregister, conservative Christian parties such as the DLP and the Christian 
Democrats appear to have been singled out for quick deregistration while left-leaning secular 
parties such as “Derryn Hinch’s Justice Party” which also received similar notices months before 
the DLP continue to be registered. It is also of great concern to us that we appear to have been 
denied natural justice in our efforts to comply with the minimum 1500 member requirement by 
being restricted to only providing 1650 names, by having only a tiny sample of these being 
contacted by the Electoral Commission and then finally by being denied the opportunity to 
provide any additional lists of members.


--- Page 2 ---

On 27 January 2022 we received a letter from the AEC delegate, Joanne Reid, advising us of the 
intention to deregister the DLP. We were given a month to supply “a statement, in writing, 
setting out the reasons why the party should not be deregistered.” 

Shortly after this notice I, as registered officer, had a conversation with a member of the AEC 
who rang me. I asked what we could include in the statement and was advised we could 
provide any statement that would explain why we should not be deregistered. I twice asked 
whether we “can we supply a new list of members” and was advised the statement can contain 
anything that demonstrates why we should not be deregistered. The person I spoke with did 
not refer to a new list or whether a new list could be supplied.  

On 26 February 2022, we submitted our statement setting out the reasons why we should not 
be deregistered including the fact that we did have over 1500 members, The email we sent with 
the statement specifically asked for permission to submit a new list of names and the 
statement itself also specifically asked for permission to submit a new list of names.  

We now find that parties who never asked for permission were permitted to lodge new lists 
along with their statement and those lists were accepted by the AEC. This despite no reference 
to supplying a new list being mentioned in the “intention to deregister” letter we received and 
no acknowledgment or suggestion that a new list could be lodged being mentioned in my 
phone conversation with the AEC, despite my specifically asking that question. 

At the very least the AEC, who are happy to call and advise us that we are being deregistered, 
could have called and said a new list would be accepted if supplied within 24 hours. I am 
seriously concerned about impartiality in the AEC when some parties were permitted to lodge a 
new list supposedly without permission while those who sought permission were ignored, to 
their detriment.  

Instead of acting on the request contained in the DLP’s statement and email, the statement 
seems to have been given priority for denial, because barely four business days later we 
received the notice of ‘Intention to Deregister.’ Meanwhile, the “Derryn Hinch Justice Party” 
which was listed for deregistration on 17 December 2021, the Health Australia Party which was 
listed on 18 January 2022 and the Australian Progressives which was listed on 11 January 2022 
all remain on the list of registered parties.  

I would suggest the least the AEC could do is to immediately restore the DLP to the list of 
Registered Parties while examining the new list of members supplied with this appeal.


--- Page 3 ---

Attached to this statement is another list of 1650 members. As mentioned we request we be 
afforded the same treatment as other parties and our qualification for registration be 
immediately re-established then re-assessed based on this list.   

In the Notice of Decision on Party Registration dated 4 March 2022, the Delegate, Joanne Reid, 
simply asserts that she “rejects the reasons outlined by (the DLP) in its statement provided on 
26 February 2022” including both the issue of the legal validity of the sampling process used to 
assess the membership number and the fact that the DLP advised that it has more membership 
names which it was prevented from providing, without explaining how or why this “rejection” is 
decided upon.  The fact that the DLP requested permission to lodge another list of members in 
the very statement the Delegate rejects while other parties, whom the same delegate would 
presumably have dealt with for deregistration purposes, were permitted to lodge new lists 
apparently without permission seems to be unfair and suggests the Delegates reasons for 
rejection of our statement are inconsistent with her or the AEC’s actions. 

Ms Reid declares that she “remain(s) satisfied that the (DLP) does not have 1500 members” 
despite the fact that we have advised that we have more than the maximum 1650 sample we 
were permitted to provide, so it is not clear how the Delegate would arrive at this prejudicial 
conclusion when it appears to be at odds with all available facts. 

The use of a sample of only 42 members to draw conclusions regarding the membership status 
of 1572 members would appear to be questionable from the standpoints of both procedural 
fairness and legal validity. In the Notice, the Delegate declares that her faith in the validity of 
this approach derives from the fact that the Electoral Commission “has previously concluded 
that the methodology was appropriate for membership testing because it was rational, fair and 
practical in all the circumstances,” however her own organization’s endorsement of its own 
process is an entirely circular justification and provides no credibility whatsoever. In fact, from a 
statistical standpoint, a parametric estimate of valid membership numbers using such a tiny 
sample must have a huge standard error and so can only logically be regarded as indicative 
rather than definitive. 

Moreover, the Delegate’s statement that she considers that a statistical estimate “provide(s) a 
more robust method for ascertaining whether a party has satisfied the requirements of the 
Electoral Act than a statement by the party” appears disingenuous.  

We did not, nor obviously would anyone else, seriously suggest that an assertion of 
membership numbers had any weight in assessing eligibility for registration. We merely pointed


--- Page 4 ---

out that we had additional members which we could have provided if we had been told that we 
were allowed to do so. 

In fact, the key question that we raised was neither this nor whether the ABS provided 
estimation method was an effective indicative tool, but rather whether statistical extrapolation 
from a sample of only 42 members could be a fair and valid method to decide definitively that a 
party which supplied 1650 member names did not have 1500 members. 

The DLP would contend that the only way to definitively assess whether a party has the 
minimum 1500 members required by the amended Electoral Act is for the AEC to contact each 
and all of the members provided.  

While this may be a major task for the AEC, given that rejection of a party’s claim to the 
required membership denies it the right to participate in our nation’s democratic processes, we 
submit respectfully that the AEC’s convenience should not be the primary consideration. 

As set out in the Administrative Review Council’s Best Practice Guide to Decision Making, an 
important legal requirement in any administrative decision making is to conform to the 
principles of natural justice, to the extent that “natural justice generally applies whenever a 
statute gives power to make an administrative decision that might adversely effects the rights, 
interests or legitimate expectations of an individual or organization.”1  Moreover, as the guide 
makes clear, “the requirement of natural justice comes from general administrative law, not 
the particular statue being administered”2 and these obligations for administrative decision 
makers are reflected in the Australian Public Service Values and Code of Conduct set down in 
the Australian Public Service Commissioner’s Directions 2016 and the Public Service Act 1999.      

The wording of the Delegate’s written decision suggests to us that she may have been 
unfamiliar with these obligations. 

In conclusion, the grounds upon which we request review of the Delegate’s decision are 

1.  That in not being advised that we were allowed to submit additional names as part of 

our statement on 26 February 2022 as other parties did, we were denied natural justice 
in the decision making process; 

1 Administrative Review Council Best Practice Guide 2, “Decision Making: Natural Justice”, 2007, p4 
2 Ibid, p5


--- Page 5 ---

2.  That in not responding to our request for permission to lodge a new list of names, as 

contained in both our email and statement of 26 February 2022, the DLP was denied the 
ability to demonstrate our eligibility to registration as was granted to numerous other 
parties; 

3.  That the means of statistical extrapolation by which the minimum membership is 

determined is neither “fair” nor “robust” but merely indicative and therefore does not 
comply with the AEC’s legal obligations to definitively determine eligibility for 
registration under the Electoral Act; 

4.  That because the AEC failed to contact 1530 of the 1650 members we supplied, the AEC 

denied us a just and equitable assessment of our membership; and 

5.  That wording of the Delegate’s written response suggests an apprehended bias against 

us and raises the possibility that we were not afforded an objective assessment. 

Accordingly we request that our registration be immediately re-established while our ongoing 
entitlement to registration is re-assessed by the Commission, including an assessment of the 
new list of 1650 member names which we attach.  

Yours sincerely 

Stephen Campbell

Request	for	Review	of	Decision	to	Deregister
Flux

To:	Mr	Tom	Rogers,	Australian	Electoral	Commissioner

CC:	The	other	members	of	the	Commission:	Justice	Kenny,	Chairperson,	and	Dr	Gruen,	the	Australian

Statistician.

This	is	a	request	for	the	Commission	to	review	the	decision,	made	on	the	24th	of	March	2022,	to

deregister	“VOTEFLUX.ORG	|	Upgrade	Democracy!”	(Flux)	under	s137(6)	of	the	Electoral	Act.	It	is

made	under	s141(2)	of	the	Electoral	Act.

I	am	making	this	request	because	the	AEC	has	been	using	and	continues	to	use	a	faulty	method	to

test	party	eligibility	with	regards	to	sufficient	membership.	Thus,	I	am	dissatisfied	with	the	decision

to	deregister	Flux.	Additionally,	as	an	Australian	elector,	a	fundamental	oversight	in	the	AEC’s	policy

could	compromise	the	democracy	that	I	am	a	constituent	of,	so	I	am	affected,	along	with	all	other

Australians.	As	part	of	this	request,	I	provide	statistical	analysis	as	grounds	that	the	AEC’s	testing

method	is	flawed.

My	Statement	to	the	Commission

I	invite	the	Commission	–	Mr	Rogers	along	with	Justice	Kenny	and	Dr	Gruen	–	to	consider	the

following	hypothetical	case	regarding	the	AEC’s	method	for	validating	that	a	party	meets	the

requirements	of	the	Electoral	Act.	I	assume	that	you	all	are	familiar	with	the	AEC’s	testing

methodology.

Consider	a	party	with	9,000	members,	and	let’s	say	that	half	of	those	members	(4,500)	are

validatable	as	electors,	and	a	further	60%	of	those	members	(2,700)	will	respond	“yes”	to	an	AEC

request	for	membership	confirmation.	It	is	natural	for	a	party	to	have	members	that	can	not	be

validated	against	the	electoral	roll	(which	can	happen	for	a	variety	of	reasons;	a	member’s	status	of

silent	elector	is	one).	Thus,	parties	go	to	some	substantial	effort	to	submit	only	those	members	that

can	be	validated	against	the	roll	–	for	reasons	that	I	hope	are	obvious	to	you	who	comprise	the

Commission.

That	is,	in	our	hypothetical	case:	4,500	members	are	not	validatable	as	electors,	and	a	further	1,800

would	deny	membership	if	asked	by	the	AEC.	The	remaining	2,700	are	legitimate.

Justice	Kenny,	as	I’m	sure	you’re	aware,	the	Electoral	Act	(EA)	specifies	that	an	eligible	party

requires	at	least	1,500	members.	In	your	legal	opinion,	would	a	party	with	2,700	members	satisfy

that	clause	of	the	EA?

I	hope	that	you	agree	that	it	would.	I	anticipate	that	you	would	also	agree	that,	all	else	being	equal,
this	hypothetical	party	appears	eligible	under	the	EA.	At	the	very	least,	we	do	not	have	a	reason	to
conclude	that	the	party	is	ineligible,	right?

Dr	Gruen,	I	wonder	if	you	are	a	man	dedicated	to	facts	and	truth	or	falsehoods	and	political	agendas.
I’m	sure	that,	as	an	expert	statistician,	you	hold	mathematical	facts	above	unsubstantiated	claims.
I’m	also	sure	that	you	appreciate	that	if	a	statistical	test	has	a	predetermined	outcome,	then	that
test	is	neither	reliable	nor	suitable	for	any	real-world	purpose.	If	you	had	a	blood	sample	processed
by	a	doctor,	would	you	accept	the	results	if	that	doctor	gave	them	to	you	before	the	blood	sample

was	taken?	No,	of	course	not,	that	would	be	crazy.

So,	Dr	Gruen,	please	consider	our	hypothetical	case.	Given	that	this	hypothetical	party	is	eligible

under	the	EA,	what	should	we	expect	as	the	results	of	the	AEC’s	testing	method	as	applied	to	this

LEX3070 Released Document No. 3Released under the Freedom of Information Act 1982


--- Page 2 ---

party?	Given	that	this	party	cannot	determine	which	of	the	4,500	validatable	members	will	respond

“yes”	or	“no”,	and	that	this	party	can	submit	no	more	than	1,650	members	due	to	AEC	policy	alone:

the	best	that	can	be	done	is	selecting	a	subset	of	those	members,	essentially	at	random.	There	may

be	some	small	optimizations	the	party	could	make,	but	in	principle	the	limiting	factors	are	those	that

we	have	already	discussed.	Thus	each	member	on	the	submitted	list	is	expected	to	respond	to	the

AEC	with	a	membership	denial	with	a	probability	of	0.4	(40%).	Of	course,	we	know	this	because

1,800	/	(2,700	+	1,800)	=	0.4,	and	because	there	is	no	reason	that	the	ratio	of	denying	members	to

confirming	members	would	change	substantially	(outside	the	statistical	variance	of	the	selection	of

1,650	members,	which	is	not	very	substantial	anyway).

Let	us	assume	that	this	hypothetical	party	randomly	selects	1,650	validatable	members	from	its	pool

of	4,500.	Dr	Gruen,	I	hope	that	you	find	this	a	reasonable	course	of	action	for	the	party	to	take	and

have	followed	the	logic	thus	far.

Dr	Gruen,	would	you	agree	that	the	accuracy	of	a	statistical	method	is	roughly:	how	often	it	results	in

true	positives	and	true	negatives?	That	is:	if	a	method	results	in	false	positives	and	false	negatives

some	of	the	time,	it	cannot	have	100%	accuracy.	If,	for	some	cases,	it	only	produces	false	positives

and	false	negatives,	then	it	has	0%	accuracy	for	those	cases.	If	there	exists	some	case	where	the

method	will	always	result	in	false	negatives,	then	we	can	conclude	that	such	a	method	is,	at	least

sometimes,	inaccurate,	yes?

I	invite	you,	Dr	Gruen,	to	please	calculate	the	probability	that	this	hypothetical	party	passes	the
AEC’s	membership	testing	methodology	–	that	the	party	passes	the	test	that	is	endorsed	by	your

bureau.	You	may	assume	that	no	members	are	filtered	out,	i.e.,	that	during	the	AEC’s	validation	of

the	membership	list	no	electors	are	excluded	for	being	duplicates,	or	deceased,	or	unmatchable

against	the	electoral	roll,	etc.

All	the	information	required	for	such	a	calculation	is	specified	above.	I	assume	that	such	a	calculation

is	trivial	for	a	statistician	such	as	yourself,	with	the	resources	available	to	you.	Surely,	you	agree	that

it	is	fairly	straight	forward	to	calculate,	yes?

Mr	Rogers,	while	Dr	Gruen	is	calculating	that	probability,	let	us	discuss	something	that	you	wrote

recently:

The	AEC’s	values	of	electoral	integrity	through	agility,	professionalism	and	quality	underpin

everything	we	do	[…]

I	also	believe	that	integrity	is	important.	Integrity	is	necessary	for	a	system	(or	a	person)	to	remain

robust.	Integrity	is	a	major	difference	between	‘stable	and	enduring’,	and	‘compromised	and

corrupted’.	When	integrity	fails,	good	systems	become	rotten.	Do	you	not	agree?

It	is	to	your	integrity,	and	the	integrity	of	Justice	Kenny	and	Dr	Gruen,	too,	that	I	make	this	appeal.	I
am	fully	aware	that	you	are	free	to	decide	whatever	you	wish	–	the	Electoral	Act	is	written	such	that
you	are	practically	unconstrained	in	this	matter.

I	ask	you	this:	if	the	AEC	and	the	ABS	were	wrong	about	the	AEC’s	testing	methodology,	how	would
you	know?	Surely	you	realize	that	it	is	possible	that	the	AEC	is	mistaken	somehow	–	that	we	are	all
fallible,	and	our	ideas	are	fallible?	Institutions	like	the	AEC,	and	methods	like	the	one	the	AEC	use,
are	based	on	ideas	that	were	thought-up	by	people,	and	are	therefore	fallible.

Justice	Kenny	and	Dr	Gruen,	do	you	also	realize	this?	That	there	are	no	infallible	humans,	no	infallible

institutions,	and	no	infallible	ideas?

Mr	Rogers,	if	it	is	possible	to	be	wrong,	what	does	it	mean	to	have	integrity	in	the	face	of	potentially

being	wrong,	and	thus	potentially	making	progress?	Should	one	take	the	path	of	honesty	and	truth-

LEX3070 Released Document No. 3Released under the Freedom of Information Act 1982


--- Page 3 ---

seeking,	or	should	one	take	the	path	of	enforcing	authority	through	baseless	claims,	evasion,	and

dismissal?	If	you	have	some	other	path	to	take,	is	it	not	one	of	honesty	and	truth-seeking?	Surely

you	would	not	advocate	a	path	that	is	dishonest	and	avoids	the	truth?	Perhaps	Justice	Kenny	has

some	insight	on	this;	I	understand	that	judges	often	have	some	experience	in	these	matters.

Now,	let	us	return	to	the	matter	of	the	accuracy	of	the	AEC’s	testing	methodology.	Dr	Gruen,	are	you

done	calculating	those	probabilities?	Let	us	compare	answers.

Here	are	my	results	with	95%	confidence	intervals:	the	probability	that	the	hypothetical	party	passes

the	AEC’s	testing	method	is	0.0020%	±	0.0012%.	The	mean	membership	denials	via	the	AEC’s	test	is

	=	23.998	±	0.010	(out	of	60	successful	contacts).	The	standard	deviation	of	that	distribution	is	

=	3.765	±	0.007.	The	SEM	for	these	results	is	

	=	0.005.

Dr	Gruen,	would	you	consider	a	statistical	method	accurate	if	the	probability	of	it	producing	a	false

negative	is	99.9980%	±	0.0012%?	Would	you	consider	that,	for	all	intents	and	purposes,	such	a

statistical	method	is	predetermined	in	its	outcome?

Justice	Kenny,	do	you	consider	it	appropriate	for	an	important	legal	institution	to	use	a	method	that,

in	some	conditions,	fails	more	than	99%	of	the	time?	What	would	our	society	be	like	if	the	courts	had

this	kind	of	failure	rate	for	certain	types	of	cases?	How	do	we	know	that	they	don’t?	How	does	the
AEC	know	that	its	method	doesn’t?	Why	are	the	answers	to	those	questions	different?

Mr	Rogers,	do	you	think	that	a	test	which,	in	some	cases	has	a	failure	rate	greater	than	99%,	should

be	used	by	a	leader	who	values	integrity	and	quality?	Do	you	think	that	a	test	which,	when	applied	to

certain	cases,	succeeds	only	0.002%	of	the	time	is	“rational,	fair	and	practical	in	all	the

circumstances”?	[1]

Dr	Gruen,	do	you	think	that	a	test	which,	for	certain	cases,	is	less	than	1%	accurate	is	“rational,	fair

and	practical	in	all	the	circumstances”?	After	all,	it	is	a	fact	that	the	AEC’s	method	performs	this

poorly	some	of	the	time.	You	have	calculated	so	yourself.	( ou	have	done	the	calculations,	haven’t

you?)

Justice	Kenny,	do	you	think	that,	when	a	citizen	appeals	to	a	judicial	process	of	their	country’s	legal

institutions,	they	deserve	the	right	to	be	taken	seriously?	That	they	deserve	the	right	to	present	their

case	and,	if	it	is	supported	by	the	facts,	to	have	an	injustice	undone?	Is	that	not	one	of	the	primary

values	of	judicial	processes	and	the	courts?	To	safeguard	citizenry	from	injustices?	To	undo	decisions
that	would	otherwise	be	mistakes?	Is	that	not	something	that	the	integrity	of	our	legal	institutions
depend	on?	Is	the	AEC	not	part	of	the	bedrock	of	our	legal	system?	(Its	foundational	role	being	that	it
provides	the	system	by	which	parliamentarians,	who	alone	can	create	and	modify	legislation,	are
elected.)

If	a	citizen	petitions	an	institution	via	a	judicial	process,	and	proves	their	case	with	mathematics	and
evidence,	what	are	they	to	do	if	that	is	not	enough?	If	that	institution	is	unconvinced	by	facts	and
evidence,	how	can	a	citizen	have	confidence	in	their	legal	system?	How	can	they	have	confidence	in
that	foundational	component	of	our	society?

Moreover,	if	judicial	processes	ignore	facts	and	evidence,	are	those	processes	serving	one	of	their

major	purposes	–	error	correction?	Is	that	not	a	core	goal	of	judicial	processes:	righting	wrongs,

undoing	mistakes,	preventing	mistakes,	promoting	justice,	and	so	on?	What	is	a	citizen	to	do	when	a
judicial	process	ignores	facts	and	evidence?

Mr	Rogers,	I	cannot	force	you	to	change	your	mind	about	anything,	that	is	solely	up	to	you.

I	can	present	you	with	this	case,	though.	Perhaps	you	(along	with	Justice	Kenny	and	Dr	Gruen)	have

guessed	that	the	hypothetical	party	was	not	so	hypothetical	after	all.	The	parameters	of	that	case

are	spitting	distance	from	those	of	Flux’s	second	membership	test	(conducted	Feb/March	2022).

There	is	at	least	one	major	difference	–	in	the	hypothetical	case,	the	party	selected	members

randomly;	in	Flux’s	case,	your	delegate	selected	1,650	members	from	the	top	of	the	list	of	4,680

members	that	Flux	submitted.	That	list	was	alphabetical,	so	the	AEC	only	sampled	from	members

whose	first	name	started	with	one	of	A	through	G.

Dr	Gruen,	in	your	expert	opinion	and	in	light	of	the	above,	and	given	that	Flux	failed	this	test,	which

of	these	should	we	believe	true?

That	Flux	has	fewer	than	1,500	members;	or

That	Flux	has	fewer	than	1,500	members	whose	first	name	starts	with	one	of	A	through	G.

If	a	party	has	1,000	(~1586	*	29/(17+29))	members	whose	first	name	starts	with	one	of	A	through	G,

how	many	members	whose	name	starts	with	one	of	H	through	Z	do	we	expect	that	party	to	have?

After	all,	what	are	the	chances	that	a	party	only	has	members	with	first	names	that	start	with	a	letter

between	A	and	G	inclusive.

The	point	of	this	argument	is	not	that	Flux	has	sufficient	members	to	satisfy	the	electoral	act.	The

point	of	this	argument	is	that	the	AEC’s	method	is	flawed.	It	is	inaccurate,	it	is	unreliable,	it	is	unfair,

and	it	is	unsuitable	–	at	least	in	this	case.	The	facts	prove	this.

I	am	not	asking	that	the	Commission	believe	me,	I	am	asking	the	Commission	to	believe	facts	and

evidence.

Justice	Kenny,	I	will	ask	you	again,	does	a	citizen	deserve	the	right	to	present	their	case	via	a	judicial

process	and,	if	it	is	supported	by	the	facts,	to	have	an	injustice	undone?	I	hope	that	your	answer	is

the	same	in	this	case	as	it	would	have	been	for	all	other	cases	that	you	have	presided	over	as	a

Judge	of	the	Court.

The	above	is	sufficient	to	conclude	that	Flux	was	wrongfully	deregistered.	It	was	wrongful	because,

regardless	of	whether	Flux	should	be	deregistered	or	not,	the	AEC’s	method	is	not	good	enough	to

produce	an	accurate	result	in	this	case.	From	a	truth-seeking	point	of	view,	the	AEC’s	test	provides

no	meaningful	information	on	whether	Flux	is	eligible	or	not.	Since	we	should	not	take	my	word	for	it,

if	our	goal	is	to	determine	whether	Flux	is	eligible	with	regards	to	sufficient	membership,	we	are	at

square	one.	Scientifically,	we	can	draw	no	conclusions	based	on	the	AEC’s	testing.	It	is	not	my	place
to	tell	you	what	should	be	done	instead	of	the	current	method,	I	can	only	demonstrate	to	you	that

the	outcome	is	predetermined	in	Flux’s	case,	as	the	test	results	in	a	false	negative	with	probability
0.999978	±	0.000013.	(These	numbers	differ	slightly	from	those	in	the	hypothetical	case	above
because	the	calculations	are	based,	specifically,	on	Flux’s	second	test.)

Mr	Rogers,	Justice	Kenny,	and	Dr	Gruen:	perhaps	this	is	not	enough	to	convince	that	there	is	a
reasonable	chance	of	some	problems	with	the	AEC’s	methodology.	The	only	other	thing	I	can	do	is
present	you	with	a	more	in-depth	statistical	analysis	of	the	method	–	covering	this	problem	and
others,	both	historical	and	on-going.	I	suppose	that	it	is	most	relevant	for	Dr	Gruen,	since	he	is	the
only	one	I	can	reasonably	expect	to	have	the	knowledge	of	statistics	necessary	to	judge	the	analysis.
To	my	knowledge,	this	is	the	first	third	party	review	of	the	AEC’s	methodology.	If	there	has	been	a
third	party	review	that	is	not	public,	I	think	that	it	is	reasonable	for	the	Commission	to	provide	it

(without	an	FOI	request).

After	I	sign	off,	you	will	find	supporting	graphs	of	the	Probability	Mass	Functions	comprising	the

statistical	analysis	from	which	my	above	results	were	drawn.	Following	that,	the	in-depth	review	of

therefore	constitutes	a	case	where	the	AEC&#39;s	method	is	completely	inaccurate.

Abstract	/	Executive	Summary

In	Australia,	to	register	a	political	party	you	need	a	minimum	number	of	members.	Federally,	that’s

usually	1500	(as	of	September	2021)	–	the	Australian	Electoral	Commission	(AEC)	will	conduct

membership	tests	to	verify	this	minimum.	Political	parties	with	a	parliamentarian	have	no	minimum

membership	limit	and	are	not	tested.	Political	parties	without	a	parliamentarian	must	go	through	a

membership	test	when	they	register,	and	then	once	every	election	cycle	thereafter.

This	document	evaluates	the	AEC’s	testing	methodology	for	particular	cases	and	finds	that	there	are
real-world	situations	where	the	testing	methodology	has	a	false	negative	(improper	failure)	rate	over
50%,	and	often	much	higher.

Therefore,	it	is	reasonable	to	conclude,	for	those	cases:	the	methodology	is	rigged	and	a	farce.

If	something	is	rigged	and	a	farce	–	based	on	the	definitions	included	and	cited	in	the	appendix	–
then	it	is	an	unfair,	empty	act,	done	for	show	where	the	outcome	is	already	known.	This	document
proves	that	the	current	method	has	unfair	and	predetermined	outcomes	for	many	situations.

Note:	I	am	not	accusing	the	AEC	of	doing	the	rigging;	just	proving	that	the	method	is
rigged.

To	date,	there	is	1	known	incident	of	a	farce,	at	least	5	suspected	incidents,	at	at	least	5	other

possible	farces.	This	is	based	only	on	results	that	the	AEC	have	published	as	part	of	a	review	(other

LEX3070 Released Document No. 3Released under the Freedom of Information Act 1982


--- Page 8 ---

results	are	not	available).

The	Flux	Party’s	recent	2021	membership	test	is	analyzed	in	multiple	ways:

Measured	case:	a	17%	membership	denial	rate	–	as	measured	by	the	AEC	during	this

membership	test.

More	extreme	–	but	realistic	–	cases:	These	are	more	extreme	cases	than	the	measured

case,	but	it	is	an	assumption	of	all	cases	that	the	party	is	eligible	under	the	Electoral	Act.

Threshold	case:	the	case	where	9.09%	(150/1650)	of	any	membership	list	submitted	will	deny

membership.	I	suspect	this	is	close	to	an	AEC	assumption	used	for	calculating	the	maximum

number	of	denials	for	the	AEC’s	testing	table	(given	their	advertised	risk	of	false	results).

Experimental	evidence	shows	that	the	measured	true	positive	rate	of	The	Flux	Party’s	2021

membership	test	was	just	28.3%	±	0.12%.	This	is	despite	the	experimental	assumption	that	Flux

has	more	members	than	the	legislatively	required	number.

In	Flux’s	threshold	case,	where	150/1650	=	9.09%	of	the	submitted	membership	list	will	deny

membership	and	24	members	are	filtered	without	replacement,	experimental	evidence	shows	that

the	AEC	method’s	true	positive	rate	was	89.0%,	which	is	less	than	the	limit	previously	advertised

(90%	or	better).	The	true	positive	rate	is	that	high	because	Flux	has	gone	to	a	great	deal	of	effort	to

increase	the	quality	of	our	membership	lists	to	avoid	members	being	filtered	–	we	did	this,	in	large

part,	to	address	inadequacies	of	the	AEC’s	methodology.	As	more	members	are	filtered

without	replacement,	the	false	negative	rate	increases	dramatically.

Experimental	evidence	proves	that	the	AEC’s	claim	that	their	membership	tests	are	90%

accurate	is	false.	In	actual	fact,	for	a	party	that	is	capable	of	providing	a	list	of	1,650	members

wherein	exactly	1,500	members	will	not	deny	membership	(and	150	will):	the	worst-case

accuracy	of	the	AEC’s	membership	test	is	just	15.1%,	indicating	a	false	negative	rate	of

84.9%.

In	other	cases,	where	a	party	is	capable	of	providing	1,500	members	that	will	not	deny	membership

(with	no	limit	on	the	number	of	members	that	will	deny	membership),	the	lower-bound	on	the

accuracy	of	the	AEC’s	method	is	0%.	That	is:	it	fails	100%	of	the	time	for	certain	eligible	parties.

This	is	not	a	theoretical	problem.	It	has	been	happening	and	continues	to	happen.	The	AEC	has	been

enforcing	a	policy	that	compromises	the	integrity	of	our	political	process.	The	ABS	has	been

complicit.	Political	elites	have	exploited	this.

Additionally,	the	AEC	mistakenly	enforced	a	testing	table	with	a	typo	for	4	years	–	it’s	unknown	if

they	ever	noticed	before	the	table	was	updated.	(See	Appendix:	AEC	Membership	Testing	Tables	/
Circa	2012	to	2016)

Disclosure	and	context:	My	roles	in	The	Flux	Party	(Flux)	were:	a	founder,	the	deputy	leader,	the
secretary,	and	the	deputy	registered	officer.

Update:	Flux	was	deregistered	on	2022-03-24.	See	8.	Flux’s	Second	Membership	Test	(March	2022).

1.	Background	Context

Recently	(leading	up	to	September	2021),	most	parliamentarians	(i.e.,	the	4	major	parties)	decided

LEX3070 Released Document No. 3Released under the Freedom of Information Act 1982


--- Page 9 ---

that	we	had	too	many	political	parties	and	that	this	was	a	problem!	It	would	not	do.	So,	a	bunch	of

changes	were	made	to	the	Electoral	Act.	Changes	designed	to	make	life	harder	for	anyone	who

wanted	to	be	part	of	our	democracy,	but	did	not	want	to	participate	in	the	rotten,	tribalist,	political

cults	that	run	the	show.	Some	of	those	changes	resulted	in	(as	of	Feb	2022)	the	pending

deregistration	of	12	parties,	and	the	very	real	deregistration	of	9	parties.	In	practice	that	is	~40%	of

parties,	gone	before	the	next	election.	Political	elites	will	claim	(and	have	claimed	in	Parliament

already)	that	these	changes,	the	culling,	and	the	subsequent	entrenchment	of	the	status	quo,	is	a

good	thing.	That	it	is	making	our	democracy	better.

In	September	2021,	the	legislatively	required	number	of	members	for	a	political	party	was	increased

from	500	to	1500	with	little	warning	and	no	grace	period.	The	AEC’s	policies	–	going	back	at	least	a

decade	–	have	encouraged	parties	not	to	bother	going	over	1.1x	the	legislative	limit	(i.e.,	previously

550,	now	1650)	with	regards	to	their	number	of	members	that	are	verifiable	against	the	roll.

(Submitting	more	than	this	is	pointless	and	makes	registration	harder.)

2.	Regular	Membership	Testing

Every	few	years,	the	Australian	Electoral	Commission	(AEC)	will	check	that	each	political	party	has

enough	members	according	to	the	legislative	requirement.	The	party	must	provide	a	list	of	1500	to
1650	names	(inclusive)	to	use	as	evidence	of	their	eligibility.	The	AEC	will	then	filter	out	some	names

(duplicates,	deceased	members,	etc).	That	produces	a	NEW	list	of	≤	1650	names.	Then,	the	AEC	will

do	a	statistical	sampling	of	members	and	will	use	that	to	determine	whether	a	party	is	eligible.

Particularly,	a	small	subset	of	members	are	selected	and	contacted,	asking	for	a	yes/no	confirmation

of	membership.	Non-responses	are	skipped.	A	“No”	answer	counts	as	a	failure	–	this	is	a	membership

denial.	In	this	document	and	associated	code:	“failure	rate”	refers	to	the	rate	at	which	members

respond	“No”.

The	AEC	does	not	accept	lists	larger	than	1650;	there	is	no	chance	for	a	party	to	replace	any	of	those
filtered	members;	that	filtering	process	increases	the	chance	of	false	negatives	(when	list	length	is

limited	+	excluding	duplicates);	parties	are	not	told	which	members	were	filtered	(even	those	which

are	deceased)	so	they	cannot	be	proactively	removed;	and,	finally,	the	standard	of	statistical

evaluation	is	to	assume	that	the	list	of	1650	members	were	the	only	members	of	the	party.	Zero

consideration	is	given	beyond	this,	outside	the	chance	to	respond	–	a	tactic	that	has,	historically,

performed	poorly	except	by	the	grace	of	the	AEC.	How	many	parties	have	been	wrongly	denied

registration	due	to	this	artificial	limit?	Nobody	knows.

The	method	is	detailed	on	pages	23	and	24	of	“Guide	for	registering	a	party”.	(mirror)

3.	Flux’s	2021	Membership	Test:	A	Known	Farce

Flux	failed	its	recent	membership	test.	The	only	problem?	We	have	at	least	4680	members	whose
details	have	been	matched	against	the	electoral	roll.	It	is	the	AEC’s	imposition	of	1650	members
maximum	that	is	the	problem.

Note	that	Flux	is	only	in	a	position	to	offer	so	many	members	because	of	our	unique	membership
system:	free	for	life.	Additionally,	significant	automation	has	been	developed	to	assist	members	in
verifying	their	details	against	the	electoral	roll	and	keeping	their	details	up	to	date.	This	is	a	task	too
involved,	expensive,	and	specialized	for	it	to	be	practical	for	most	political	parties.

AEC’s	Notice	to	Flux	(with	test	results)

Our	Response

From	the	AEC’s	notice	(note	that	the	AEC	refuses	membership	lists	with	more	than	1650	members):

LEX3070 Released Document No. 3Released under the Freedom of Information Act 1982


--- Page 10 ---

On	7	December	2021,	the	Party	responded	to	the	s	138A	Notice	by	providing	a	list	of	between

1,500	and	1,650	members	of	the	Party.

I	am	notifying	you	under	s	137(1)(b)	of	the	Electoral	Act	that	the	Electoral	Commission	is

considering	deregistering	the	Party,	as	the	Electoral	Commission	is	satisfied	on	reasonable

grounds	that	the	Party	does	not	have	at	least	1,500	members.	A	copy	of	the	s	137(1)(b)	Notice

is	enclosed.

Here	is	an	except	from	the	first	page	of	our	response,	to	give	you	an	idea	of	the	gist:

We	have	3	arguments	supporting	our	case.	Each	argument	is	individually	sufficient	to	show	that

a	decision	(by	the	AEC)	to	deregister	the	Party	would	not	be	based	on	reasonable	grounds;	each

argument	is	a	decisive	criticism	of	the	current	methodology.

The	statistical	method	used	fails	~10%	of	the	time	for	borderline	cases.

The	statistical	method	uses	an	artificially	limited	sample	size	and	thus	does	not	estimate

party	membership,	though	does	(roughly)	measure	membership	attrition.

We	have	sufficient	membership	and	provide	evidence.	Attached	is	a	list	of	4680

members.	Each	entry	was,	at	some	point,	verified	against	the	electoral	roll.

Unless	each	of	these	criticisms	can	be	addressed,	we	do	not	believe	that	a	decision	by	the	AEC

to	deregister	the	Party	would	be	based	in	reality.

(Note:	there	are	at	least	two	non-critical	errors	in	our	response	–	the	AEC	has	already	been	informed.

See	the	end	of	the	doc	for	what	was	sent	to	the	AEC	re	those	errors.)

I	became	curious	about	the	actual	statistical	properties	of	the	AEC’s	process.	How	likely	would	it

have	been	for	us	to	succeed?	(Given	that	we	are	in	fact	an	eligible	party.)

Turns	out	there	was	a	71.7%	chance	that	the	AEC’s	method	would	find	a	false	negative.

TL;DR:	It’s	rigged.

In	this	document	and	the	associated	code	and	graphs:	a	farce	is	defined	as	any	case	where	the

chance	of	a	false	negative	is	≥	50%,	i.e.,	statistical	accuracy	is	≤	50%.

The	AEC’s	membership	test	being	rigged	means	that,	in	some	relevant	cases,	the	outcome	is

predetermined.	Since	there	are	cases	where	an	eligible	party	will	have	~0%	chance	of	success,	it	is

the	case	that	there	exist	relevant	cases	where	the	outcome	is	predetermined.

4.	Analysis	Methodology

The	code	associated	with	this	document	produces	statistical	graphs	(of	the	Probability	Mass
Function,	specifically)	based	on	500,000	simulations	of	the	AEC’s	method.

For	each	simulation,	the	number	of	failures	is	recorded	as	the	output.	Subsequently,	these	results
are	normalized	to	give	the	probability	of	X	failures	for	the	given	input	parameters.	These
probabilities	are	then	graphed,	with	the	x-axis	showing	the	number	of	failures,	and	the	y-axis
showing	
(membership	denials).	As	the	AEC	has	limits	on	the	acceptable	number	of	membership	denials	based

	–	i.e.,	the	probability	of	a	membership	test	having	a	certain	number	of	failures

on	the	reduced	membership	list,	the	bars	in	these	PMFs	are	colored	blue	or	orange	to	indicate	a	pass
or	a	failure.	In	cases	where	the	party	does	meet	legislative	requirements,	the	blue	bars	( P(success) )
should,	according	to	AEC	Policy,	always	sum	to	 &gt;	0.9 .	Where	 P(success)	&lt;	0.5 ,	the	case	is	deemed
a	farce	and	marked	as	such.

What	happens	if	Flux	gains	more	members?

Moreover,	say	that	Flux	is	gaining	members	faster	than	it	is	losing	them.	(‘Losing’	members	means

that	they	will	now	answer	“No”	but	do	not	revoke	their	membership.)	It	turns	out	that	this	can	make

the	AEC’s	methodology	less	likely	to	succeed.	Go	figure:	a	party	increases	it’s	membership	and	the

AEC	test	get’s	less	accurate!	See	Fig	5.2,	Example	5.2.1,	Example	5.2.2	(Filtered=0),	Example	5.2.3

(Filtered=24).

The	system	is	rigged.	It’s	a	farce.

Finally,	there	are	cases	where	the	AEC’s	method	fails	even	more	spectacularly.

Say	50%	of	Flux’s	4680	members	submitted	(as	part	of	our	objection	to	the	AEC’s	consideration	of

involuntary	deregistration)	respond	“No”	–	the	AEC’s	method	fails	100%	of	the	time	in	this	case,

even	though	Flux	would	exceed	the	legislative	requirement	by	1.56x.	See	Fig	5.3,	and	related:

Example	5.3.1.

Update:	additionally,	see	8.	Flux’s	Second	Membership	Test	(March	2022).

Reading	These	Graphs

N	Members:	The	number	of	members	that	the	party	is	capable	of	submitting,	i.e.,	they	are
validated	to	the	best	of	the	party’s	ability.

Submitted:	The	number	of	members	that	the	party	submits	to	the	AEC.

Filtered	Out:	The	number	of	members	removed	without	replacement	by	the	AEC	–	parties	cannot

preemptively	remove	these	members	as	the	AEC	uses	information	that	is	unavailable	to	parties.

Sample:	The	number	of	members	after	AEC	filtering.

P(denial):	The	probability	that	a	member	will	deny	membership	when	contacted.

(Y:	…,	N:	…):	The	number	of	members	that,	when	contacted	by	the	AEC,	will	respectively

respond:	“yes”,	and	“no”.	Note:	if	a	member	does	not	respond	to	a	request	for	contact,	the	AEC
selects	a	new	member	to	contact	from	the	sample.

Simulations:	The	number	of	times	the	AEC	test	was	simulated	while	generating	the	distribution.

Eligible?:	whether	the	party	is	eligible	under	the	Electoral	Act.

Exhaustive	test:	would	the	party	pass	a	membership	test	if	every	member	in	the	sample	group
were	contacted?	Note:	this	is	limited	by	AEC	policy	to	1650	(or	550	prior	to	Sept	2021).

“x	bar”	( ):	The	mean	of	the	distribution,	i.e.,	the	average	number	of	denials.

“sigma	sub	x”	(

):	Standard	deviation	of	the	distribution.

“sigma	sub	x	bar”	(

):	Standard	error	of	the	distribution.

P(Conflict:	AEC	Method	↔	Exhaustive):	The	probability	that	the	AEC’s	method	conflicts	with	the

results	of	an	exhaustive	test.

P(Conflict:	AEC	Method	↔	Reality):	The	probability	AEC’s	method	fails	(i.e.,	produces	a	false

positive	or	false	negative).

±:	This	indicates	the	95%	confidence	interval.	That	is:	the	95%	confidence	interval	for	a±b	has	a

lower	bound	of	a-b	and	an	upper	bound	of	a+b.

6.	Suspected	Farces

LEX3070 Released Document No. 3Released under the Freedom of Information Act 1982


--- Page 16 ---

Detecting	previous	farces	is	difficult	because	the	AEC	does	not	publish	the	results	of	membership

tests	and,	too	my	knowledge,	does	not	record	or	ask	for	the	number	of	members	a	party	could	offer

in	support	of	their	validity.	Instead,	we	only	know	the	number	of	members	that	were	submitted,

which	is	always	&lt;=	1650	(or	the	limit	in	effect	at	the	time),	and	we	only	know	this	when	the	AEC	has

published	a	statement	of	reasons	which	is	only	done	when	there	is	a	request	for	review.	If	a	party

just	gives	up,	or	otherwise	misses	the	deadline,	then	we	don’t	hear	about	it	and	thus	cannot

evaluate	whether	a	farce	occurred.

Note:	these	cases	occurred	prior	to	the	September	2021	increase	in	required	members.	Therefore

they	are	judged	against	the	previous	requirements	–	the	test	method	was	practically	the	same,	the

only	difference	being	that	it	was	calibrated	for	membership	lists	of	500-550	instead	of	1500-1650.

Since	parties	sometimes	max	out	the	number	of	members	they	may	provide,	the	only	reasonable

conclusion	is	that	they	have	more	members	they	could	provide	if	a	more	responsible	method	were

used.

Therefore,	parties	are	assumed	to	have	just	enough	excess	capacity	in	additional	members	to	be

eligible,	and	that	those	extra	members	could	have	been	provided.

Excess	Capacity	Explanation

Excess	capacity	here	refers	to	additional	members	that,	if	not	for	the	AEC’s	limit,	a	party	could

provide	–	expressed	as	a	percentage	of	the	limit.	If	a	party	requires	10%	excess	capacity,	and	the

limit	of	a	membership	list	is	1650,	then	that	party	must	be	capable	of	providing	a	list	of	1815

members	that	a	list	of	1650	members	is	randomly	sampled	from.

For	comparison:	in	Flux’s	case,	we	had	3030	additional	members	(excess	capacity	of	184%)	–

excluding	those	that	we	could	not	validate.	The	AEC	is	sometimes	able	to	validate	members	that	we

cannot,	and	we	have	at	least	4285	additional	members	that	we	could	contact	with	a	request	for

them	to	update	their	details.

What	about	cases	where	the	member	list	submitted	had	a	large	number	of	duplicates?	It	is	not	safe

to	assume	the	absence	of	a	farce	in	these	cases:	maintaining	membership	lists	is	difficult.	In	my

case,	I	wrote	thousands	of	lines	of	custom	code	to	assist	Flux	in	managing	our	member	list	–	and

the	proportion	of	our	list	that	is	automatically	matched	against	the	electoral	roll	is	proof	of	this.	But,

even	with	multiple	checks	for	duplicates	(matching	phone	numbers,	emails,	first	and	last	names,

etc),	still	we	would	occasionally	get	duplicates.	These	stragglers	were	usually	found	through	a

manual	process	before	submission.	At	some	point	it	just	isn’t	worth	worrying	about.	However,	due	to

the	ambiguity	of	these	cases,	this	document	will	exclude	them	from	“suspected”	farces.

The	Suspected	Farces

Since,	in	the	following	cases,	the	excess	capacity	of	the	party	undergoing	testing	was	not	known,
these	are	only	suspected	farces.

1.	 (Fig	6.1)	30	June	2021	–	deregistration	of	Child	Protection	Party	under	s	137(6)	(mirror)	–	excess

capacity	of	13.4%	required

2.	 (Fig	6.2)	9	March	2021	–	deregistration	of	Seniors	United	Party	under	s	137(6)	(mirror)	–	excess

Possible	Farces

These	are	cases	where	the	available	information	regarding	the	membership	test	is	incomplete,	so

some	assumptions	have	had	to	be	made.	Based	on	AEC	measurements,	if	the	party	had	some
minimum	number	of	members	(such	that	it	had	at	least	500	non-denying	members),	then	these

cases	are	farces.

LEX3070 Released Document No. 3Released under the Freedom of Information Act 1982


--- Page 22 ---

Flux	is	a	party	that	has	–	with	regards	to	membership	lists	–	excess	capacity;	if	filtered	members

could	be	replaced,	we	could	provide	them.	Note	that	filtered	members	are	never	replaced	in	the

AEC’s	method.

Given	this,	combined	with	the	artificial	limit	on	sample	size,	what	are	the	true	accuracy	values	for

the	AEC’s	test?

As	it	turns	out,	it	depends	on	the	quality	of	Flux’s	membership	list.	We	have	a	high-quality	list	–

thanks	to	a	lot	of	management	code	written	to	help	with	that	–	but	many	parties	do	not	have	the

skills	or	resources	to	do	that.

Fig	7.1	shows	that,	for	Flux’s	recent	membership	test,	the	true	accuracy	of	the	AEC’s	method	–
assuming	that	Flux’s	members	have	 P(denial)	=	0.0909 	–	was	89.0%;	which	is	lower	than	the	90%
accuracy	that’s	been	advertised	in	the	past.	That	means	that	the	results	of	the	AEC’s	test	would

incorrectly	find	Flux	ineligible	11%	of	the	time.

Additionally,	Fig	7.2	and	7.3	show	that,	as	the	number	of	members	filtered	out	increases,	accuracy

drops	–	a	lot.

@Thresh 	in	these	titles	indicates	a	9.09%	denial	rate	(which	is	not	what	was	measured	during	Flux’s
recent	membership	test).	9.09%	=	150	/	1650.

+F__ 	indicates	that	the	number	in	place	of	 __ 	is	the	number	of	members	that	were	filtered	out
(e.g.,	duplicates,	deceased	members,	etc).

Fig	7.1:	Assuming	that	91.9%	of	the	members	(randomly	sampled	from	the	full	list)	on	Flux&#39;s	2021
membership	test	will	not	deny	membership	when	contacted	(1500/1650):	500,000	simulations	of

Flux&#39;s	membership	test	show	that	it	has	an	accuracy	of	89.0%	(i.e.,	false	negative	rate	of	11.0%),

which	is	less	than	the	AEC&#39;s	previously	advertised	90%	accuracy.

8.	Flux’s	Second	Membership	Test	(March	2022)

After	Flux’s	response	in	February	2022,	the	AEC	decided	of	its	own	accord	to	conduct	another

membership	test.	Flux	did	not	request	this.	In	fact,	it	makes	no	sense	for	Flux	to	request	this

because	we	were	primarily	concerned	with	the	inability	of	the	test	to	function	as	intended.	The	AEC

ignored	our	criticisms.	It	appears	that	the	AEC	does	not	care	about	reason,	or	logic,	or	statistical

arguments.

As	though	to	emphasize	the	fact	that	the	AEC’s	method	is	a	joke,	the	AEC’s	statement	of	reasons

[mirror],	authored	by	one	Ms	Reid,	says:

 	22.	The	membership	list	submitted	by	the	Party	on	13	February	2022	contained	4,680	names

of	individuals	that	the	Party	considers	to	be	current	members	(referred	to	as	‘members’	below).

As	a	delegate	of	the	Electoral	Commission,	I	instructed	that	the	top	1,650	names	be	tested	to

conform	with	the	AEC’s	membership	testing	parameters.	[…]

LEX3070 Released Document No. 3Released under the Freedom of Information Act 1982


--- Page 25 ---

The	membership	list	that	we	submitted	was	sorted	alphabetically	by	first	name.	“Gloria”	was	the	first

member	to	miss	out	on	the	chance	to	be	contacted.	Every	member	whose	first	name	came	later	than

hers,	alphabetically,	was	excluded.

The	Statement	of	“Reasons”

Let	me	grace	you	with	the	AEC’s	wisdom.

First,	consider	that	Flux	did	not	ask	for	another	membership	test,	and	argued	that	the	method	was

invalid;	the	list	of	4680	members	was	not	provided	for	the	purpose	of	a	membership	test,	it	was

provided	as	evidence	that	the	AEC’s	method	was	in	conflict	with	reality.

The	“supporting	statement”	comprises:

 	25.	I	have	considered	the	statement	lodged	by	the	Party	on	13	February	2022,	setting	out

reasons	why	the	Party	should	not	be	deregistered.

[Omitted:	quotes	of	Flux’s	February	2022	response]	

 	26.	I	reject	the	reasons	outlined	by	the	Party	in	its	statement	provided	on	13	February	2022

for	the	following	reasons.	

 	27.	The	Party	failed	membership	testing	for	exceeding	the	maximum	number	of	permitted

denials	according	to	the	ABS	methodology	used	by	the	AEC.	It	did	not	fail	membership	testing

due	to	having	an	insufficient	number	of	members	being	identified	on	the	electoral	roll.	

 	28.	The	Electoral	Act	defines	an	elector	as	someone	that	is	on	the	Commonwealth	Electoral

Roll.	Section	123	of	the	Electoral	Act	prescribes	that	an	eligible	political	party,	not	being	a

Parliamentary	party,	has	‘at	least	1,500	members’.	The	requirement	is	not	to	be	solely	‘an

elector’	but	to	be	a	member	of	the	party.	

 	29.	The	Party	challenges	the	validity	of	the	AEC’s	membership	testing	process.	This	process

has	been	developed	by	the	AEC	to	support	the	delegate’s	consideration	of	whether	a	party	has

sufficient	members.	It	is	based	on	sampling	methodology	designed	in	consultation	with	the	ABS

and	provides	a	valid	methodology	to	satisfy	a	delegate	of	a	party’s	membership.	The	Electoral

Commission	has	previously	concluded	that	the	methodology	‘was	appropriate	for	membership

1
testing,	including	because	it	was	rational,	fair	and	practical	in	all	the	circumstances.’ 	

 	30.	I	consider	that	the	membership	testing	results	outlined	above	provide	a	more	robust

method	for	ascertaining	whether	a	party	has	satisfied	the	requirements	of	the	Electoral	Act	than

a	statement	provided	by	the	party.	

 	31.	In	summary,	I	remain	satisfied	that	the	Party	does	not	have	at	least	1,500	members

based	on	the	outcomes	from	membership	testing	both	membership	lists	of	7	December	2021

and	13	February	2022.	

 	32.	Accordingly,	in	my	capacity	as	a	delegate	of	the	Electoral	Commission,	I	have
deregistered	VOTEFLUX.ORG	|	Upgrade	Democracy!	under	s	137(6)	of	the	Electoral	Act	and	the
particulars	of	the	Party	have	been	cancelled	from	the	Register	under	s	138	of	the	Electoral	Act.

Ms	Reid	knows	this,	why	did	she	make	point	27?	That	the	AEC	method	failed	in	spite	of	Flux

9.	Feedback	Loops	Between	AEC	Policy	and	Party	Behavior

To	my	knowledge,	parties	typically	don’t	try	to	build	membership	to	many	thousands	of	members.

That’s	because	it’s	expensive,	time	consuming,	and	difficult	to	manage.	Most	importantly	–	there’s

no	point	when	it	comes	to	registration.

The	fact	that	the	AEC	has	imposed	this	flawed	method	for	years	means	that	non-parliamentary

parties’	common	practices	are	based	around	meeting	the	AEC’s	policies.	When	the	limit	was	550
(and	500	members	required),	there	literally	was	no	point	building	beyond	that	because	it	would	not

help	you	in	registering	or	maintaining	registration	–	it	was	largely	wasted	effort.

Additionally,	the	AEC’s	policies	have	entrenched	these	common	practices	which	enabled	the	political

elite	to	change	the	legislative	requirements	suddenly	and	dramatically	–	effectively	eliminate
competition.	The	AEC	is	complicit.

If	the	previous	status	quo	was	550	members	due	to	the	AEC	promulgating	a	culture	of	not	going
beyond	this,	and	then	parliament	decides	to	radically	change	the	limit	(there	is	no	reason	they	could
not	have	done	this	gradually	over,	say,	10	years	with	a	small	bump	each	year),	at	what	point	do	we
acknowledge	that	something	is	rotten?

The	AEC	is	on	record	about	why	it	imposes	a	limit	on	membership	lists	used	for	verification:

 	26.	In	respect	of	the	assertion	in	the	application	for	review	that	the	AEC	failed	to	test	the	lists

provided	by	the	Party	on	12	June	2017	(which	contained	650	members)	and	on	20	August	2017

(which	contained	739	members),	the	Commission	notes	that	the	‘Party	Registration	Guide’

requests	that	parties	provide	a	list	of	between	500	to	550	members.	This	is	considered	to	be	to

a	party’s	advantage,	by	minimizing	the	work	required	of	the	party	in	confirming	the	enrolment

/2018-commonwealth-of-australia-party-statement-of-reasons.pdf	(mirror)

Note:	this	case	cannot	be	analyzed	as	the	AEC	neglected	to	include	any	results	of	membership	tests.

How	about	the	AEC	stop	making	decisions	on	behalf	of	parties?	Especially	when	those	decisions	have

been	proven	(by	this	document)	to	have	systemically	disadvantaged	non-parliamentary	parties,	to

have	decreased	the	accuracy	of	the	AEC	membership	test,	to	be	based	on	falsehoods,	and,

ultimately,	to	be	a	reflection	of	a	condescension	and	hubris	that	has	no	place	running	a	democracy.

10.	Conclusion

With	the	AEC’s	existing	policies,	and	on	the	assumption	that	Flux	is	a	valid	party,	it	is	only

reasonable	to	conclude	that	Flux	will	find	it	increasingly	difficult	to	remain	registered	and	pass

registration	tests,	even	if	it	grows	in	membership.	This	applies	to	all	nonparliamentary	parties.	That

is	to	say:	the	process	has	a	predetermined	outcome,	and	is	an	empty	act	done	for	show.	It	is	rigged,

and	a	farce.

With	currently	measured	values	(based	on	AEC	results),	it	would	take	(on	average)	7	repeated	trials

for	Flux	to	have	1	successful	membership	test.	So	this	is	not	a	problem	that	can	be	solved	by

repeating	the	membership	test.

At	least	5	past	cases	have	been	identified	with	farcical	properties	–	they	are	suspected	farces	–	and

at	least	5	additional	cases	have	incomplete	information	but	may	be	farcical.

That	is:	in	these	cases	the	AEC’s	test	is	less	than	50%	accurate,	provided	that	those	parties	had

additional	members	(which	the	party	would	have	been	prevented	from	submitting	only	due	to	AEC

policy).	All	5	suspected	cases	required	less	than	15%	additional	members	–	i.e.,	the	membership	test
was	a	farce	for	all	cases	if	N	≥	630.	Note	that	all	5	cases	predate	the	September	2021	change	to

membership	requirements;	at	the	time	the	required	number	of	members	was	500.

It	has	thus	been	found	that	the	AEC’s	method	is	rigged	and	a	farce,	and	that	there	is

sufficient	evidence	to	back	this	up.

Note:	the	first	column	of	these	tables	(“Members	lodged”,	“Eligible	membership”)	is	the	reduced

membership	list	after	filtering	out	e.g.,	duplicates,	members	supporting	the	registration	of	other

parties,	deceased	members,	etc.

It	is	“AEC	Policy”	that	lists	are	no	more	than	1.1x	the	legislative	limit	(e.g.,	a	maximum	of	550	prior

to	September	2021,	and	1650	after	September	2021).	That	is:	lists	with	more	members	than	this	are
rejected.

Note:	It	seems	likely	that	 max	denials	to	pass =3	for	the	 members	lodged =529	row	is	a	typo	–	it
should	probably	be	 4 ,	however,	in	all	source	documents	it	was	 3 .	In	the	2016	RPA	statement	of
reasons,	a	list	of	530	lead	to	38	contacts,	and	4	or	more	denials	was	a	fail	(so	 max	denials	to
pass =3).	This	typo	has	been	enforced.	(How	many	times?	Only	the	AEC	knows.)

According	to	the	sampling	methodology,	as	applied	to	a	list	of	530	names,	if	four	or	more	people
denied	membership	then	the	AEC	could	conclude	that	the	party	did	not	have	500	members.4

LEX3070 Released Document No. 3Released under the Freedom of Information Act 1982


--- Page 32 ---

[Footnote	4:]	According	to	the	ABS,	testing	a	sample	of	38	from	a	list	of	530	carried	with	it	a

2.72%	risk	that	the	AEC	could	end	up	accepting	a	party	that	had	only	400	members,	and	a

6.17%	risk	that	the	AEC	could	end	up	rejecting	a	party	that	had	500	members.

So	there	was	a	typo	at	some	point,	but	the	AEC	actually	used	the	typo	to	judge	party	membership.

So	a	party	with	between	529	and	536	members	during	this	period,	with	4	denials,	would	have	been

wrongly	denied	even	by	the	AEC’s	own	methodology.	Also,	the	footnote	values	don’t	match	the

previously	advertised	values	in	the	table…	is	that	just	because	it’s	calculated	for	530	instead	of	529?

Or	did	the	AEC	get	an	updated	table	in	2016	and	those	risk	values	changed?	If	they	did	change,	why?

(It’s	not	like	the	maths	changed,	right?)

The	2016	Australian	Democrats	statement	of	reasons	confirms	34	contacts	for	a	list	of	526	with

maximum	3	denials.

According	to	the	sampling	methodology,	as	applied	to	a	list	of	526	names,	if	four	or	more	people

3
denied	membership	then	the	AEC	could	conclude	that	the	party	did	not	have	500	members.

[Footnote	3:]	According	to	the	ABS,	testing	a	sample	of	34	from	a	list	of	526	carried	with	it	a

2.30%	risk	that	the	AEC	could	end	up	accepting	a	party	that	had	only	400	members,	and	a

8.53%	risk	that	the	AEC	could	end	up	rejecting	a	party	that	had	500	members.

Experimental	Eval

Note:	The	row	with	 members	lodged = 529	(corrected) 	corrects	the	erroneous	 max	denials	to	pass
from	 3 	to	 4 .	The	AEC	did	not	pick	up	on	this	error	for	at	least	4	years	(if	they	ever	did).

The	italicized	part	is	not	correct.	The	AEC&#39;s	method	is	much	better	than	this	--	it	only	fails	10%	to

20%	of	the	time	(the	above	quote	implies	that	the	method	fails	more	than	50%	of	the	time).	The

exact	false	negative	rate	depends	on	the	number	of	members	filtered	by	the	AEC,	similar	to	how

our	December	2021	list	of	1649	names	had	24	entries	filtered.	The	AEC&#39;s	method	is	more

reliable	when	fewer	names	are	filtered,	with	the	20%	false	negative	rate	corresponding	to	25

members	filtered	out.	(0	names	filtered	corresponds	to	a	10%	false	negative	rate.)

It	is	worth	pointing	out	that	there	are	similar	(though	slightly	more	extreme)	parameters	that	do

result	in	a	&gt;50%	failure	rate	of	the	AEC&#39;s	method.	For	example	a	party	of	2000	members,	300	of

which	are	malicious,	and	15	names	filtered	has	a	failure	rate	of	50.4%.

My name is

I was linked to an article on the website of the flux party via one of their communication channels: 
https://www.voteflux.org/2022/04/20/wrongful-deregistration/ 

This article outlines reasons that the flux party believe their deregistration was unfair/unjust and I agree with their 
reasoning; that there is no reason not to poll the list of active memberships extensively to reach the firmest result. 
The flux party pose a plausible attempt at contesting the status quo and creating a better life for all Australians, so I 
ask that you please review your recent decision to deregister flux party. 

Thanks,

Application under s 141(2) regarding Health Australia Party

CAUTION: This email originated from outside of the Australian Federal Government. Do not click links or open 
attachments unless you recognise the sender and know the content is safe. 

To: Mr Tom Rogers 
via email: commission.secretariat@aec.gov.au 

Hi, 

This is an application under s 141(2) of the EA to review the decision to deregister Health Australia Party (HAP) [1]. 

I learned of HAP&#39;s deregistration on the 14th of April. 

As a voter I am affected by the wrongful deregistration of political parties and I am concerned that the AEC&#39;s 
processes are inadequate. Thus I am concerned that wrongful deregistrations have occurred many times and are 
continuing to occur -- HAP being just one example of more than a do en. 

Particularly: I do not believe the AEC&#39;s membership testing method is accurate enough to support the decision. 

This is because, based on the statistics gathered and published by the AEC in [1], the AEC&#39;s method had a false 
negative rate of 72.34% ± 0.12% if HAP has &gt; 1769 members. That is, *if* HAP has &gt; 1769 members, *then* it is 
expected that the AEC&#39;s method has that false negative rate. 

The number 1769 is important because, based on the data gathered by the AEC, *if* HAP could have submitted 
1769 members then they would have passed this hypothetical membership test. (Note, there is no mathematical 
reason that the membership test methodology could not simply allow longer lists; the only restriction is *AEC policy 
alone*.) 

HAP&#39;s Nov 2021 membe ship test had a false negative rate of 72.40% ± 0.12% if HAP has &gt; 1769 members. 

This means that, if HAP has more than 1769 members (which would imply they are an eligible party), that the 
probability that HAP passed either the first test or failed the first but passed the second was only 0.476 -- i.e., 47.6%. 
That&#39;s worse odds than a coin flip. 

S nce the AEC, *by the Commission&#39;s own policy,* does not allow a party to submit more than 1650 members as 
part of the test methodology, there is no way -- by the best known principles of statistics and the philosophy of 
science available to us -- that the AEC can be statistically confident in the results of the membership test 
methodology, and thus the Commission does not have statistical grounds for the decision to deregister. This is 
especially poignant considering that HAP claims to have ~4,000 members nationally [1]. Considering the AEC&#39;s 
measurements to-date, it is reasonable to expect that HAP could produce an additional 129 members unless 
evidence can be produced to contradict this. The membership testing method does not gather such evidence -- and 
parties are forbidden from submitting additional members -- so it is a mystery how the AEC would have such 
evidence. In fact, if the lists that HAP submitted to the AEC have fewer than 1521 overlapping members, HAP has 

1

LEX3070 Released Document No. 6Released under the Freedom of Information Act 198210


--- Page 2 ---

already proven to the AEC that it does have sufficient membership. 

How many members were on both lists submitted by HAP? 

Given the above, I request that the decision to deregister HAP be set aside. 

As evidence of my claims, please see [2] -- particularly Fig 6.6 which is the results of the statistical analysis of HAP&#39;s 
Feb 2022 membership test. (A link to the results of the analysis of HAP&#39;s Nov 2021 membership test are linked in Fig 
6.6&#39;s description.) 

Additionally, I note that the AEC has made trivial mistakes in the documentation and execution of the method (see 
[3]), so I have no faith that those employees or delegates of the Commission that execute the method have any idea 
whatsoever about how to do it correctly, what the requirements for statistical validity are, or how to check that they 
are not making a mistake. 

Thus, the Commission should also reconsider their entire testing framework, setting aside all decisions to deregister 
or refuse registration on the basis of the results of the testing method until such a time when the Commission 
obtains the relevant skills necessary to develop a method that is not predetermined  n some cases. I can&#39;t request 
that under s 141(2); it&#39;s just my opinion. Seems worth mentioning, though.

Mr Tom Rogers 

AEC 

Commission.secretariat.aec.gov.au 

Dear Mr Rogers, 

RE: BDPXL8:  Notice 
under 137(6) to deregister the Health Australia Party (HAP) dated 5/4/2022 

I refer to the above noted decision by Joanne Reid to 
deregister HAP and I now formally request a review of the decision under S 
141(2) of the Electoral Act. 

I have sought advice from a number of people, especially Mr Mark 
Aldridge in Adelaide. The three principal reasons for making this application 
are: 

1.    1.  The method used by the AEC to determine our eligibility 

is not legislated, and we have been advised would not withstand a legal 
challenge. We have been advised that the direction to submit a list of only 
1,650 members is not legislated. We believe that we should have been allowed to 
submit our full member list of around 3,000 members and allow either the AEC to 

2

10LEX3070 Released Document No. 7Released under the Freedom of Information Act 1982


--- Page 3 ---

demonstrate that we did not have 1,500 members or, conversely allow that list 
to demonstrate we did have more than 1,500 members. 

2.    2.  We understand that the 36 members you identified 

as supporting the registration of another Party were not contacted to inquire 
if they wished to be considered as members of the HAP, or the other Party, 
meaning that some probably should have been included in our audit. 

3.      

3. Unfairness: The AEC denied our 
request, as a nationally registered Party, to access the ELIAS database for 
every State and Territory to allow us to confirm that members were correctly 
enrolled on the electoral rolls. We were only given access to the Victorian 
database. This materially restricted our ability to correct our national roll 
(which we had, prior to the second submission, reduced from around 4,000 
members to around 3,000 members). That would have meant that the 5 deceased 
members and the 16 members not able to be matched to the electoral roll would 
not have been included in our list, and we would have had the opportunity to supply you with a more 
accurate list. 

Mr Aldridge advised us that other issues could be raised, 
but we believe that the three above issues alone warrant a review and overturning 
of the decision that the HAP does not have 1,500 members. If, as part of your 
review, we are required to submit our complete list of members, we would first 
request that we be given access to the full ELIAS database so that we can prune 
any deceased or unenrolled people from our list of 3,000. We believe even a further severe pruning would 
demonstrate we have over 2,500 current members. 

We appreciate your consideration of our submission, including your advice as to our current status regarding the 
election which has not yet been called. 

Yours sincerely, 

Dr Isaac 
Golden 

National Secretary 

Health Australia Party

TO 

Mr Tom Rogers Australian Electoral Commissioner 

Dear Mr Rogers 

Thank you for the email notifying me of the decision dated 18 March 2022 to register the David Pocock 
party. 

I 

 of 

 seek internal review of the decision. 

I note that I have made an FOI request for all documents relating to consideration of my objection to the 
decision to register the David Pock Party. I believe those documents may inform my internal review 
request.  

I am conscious of the public interest in resolving this matter quickly and I have requested expeditious 
processing of my FOI application. I had hoped that the AEC would recognise the public interest in speedy 
resolution of internal review requests and would process the related FOI request speedily. I am therefore 
disappointed that my FOI request has still not been determined.  I seek your agreement to my 
supplementing this internal review request when the response to my FOI application is received. 

It is apparent from reading the decision to register the David Pocock Party that the decision-maker has 
taken an extraordinarily narrow approach to statutory interpretation. The decision-maker has followed a 
‘ticking boxes’ approach without consideration of the scheme of the legislation or its purpose. Also, 
notwithstanding a heading ‘Findings of Fact and Consideration’ the decision-maker has failed to make a 
finding of fact in relation to a key factual issue raised in the objections.  

It follows that the decision is fundamentally flawed. 

Two key issues were raised in the objections to the application to register the David Pocock Party. 

Issue (1)-that at the time of the application for registration it was clear from interviews published in the 
media including in the major ACT daily newspaper the Canberra Times that Mr David Pocock has publicly 
admitted that he was a citizen of a foreign country, Zimbabwe, and therefore ineligible for the Senate. 

This public admission is a serious question of fact.

The decision-maker has failed to make a relevant finding of fact.  

It was necessary for the decision-maker first to make a relevant finding of fact relating to matters raised in 
the objections then to set out reasons in relation to the legal significance of that finding of fact. 

The purpose of registration is to enable ‘above the line’ voting. Registration that would facilitate ‘election’ 
of a candidate not lawfully eligible would clearly be contrary to the scheme of the Act. 

The AEC will be aware that before the last election the AEC failed to establish proper eligibility procedures, 
as a result of this procedural failure on the part of the AEC persons who were ineligible nominated, 
election of a number of persons were subsequently overturned by the High Court on the foreign 
citizenship issue. Some regard the AEC as having failed properly to perform its functions eg properly 
drawing attention to the legal requirements to be eligible to nominate. 

The AEC should not in effect mislead the Australian public by registering as a party the name of a person 
who at the time of the application for registration on his own admission was not eligible for election. 

I emphasise that my submission is not that the AEC should itself determine eligibility. That is not the AEC’s 
function. My submission is that, Mr Pocock having publicly admitted that he was a citizen of Zimbabwe, 
the AEC should not have ignored the consequences when determining the registration application. 

As a minimum, having regard to Mr Pocock’s public admission that he was a citizen of Zimbabwe, and 
having regard to objections raising this issue, certain consequences should have been followed. 

The AEC and the decision-maker should have found as a fact that Mr Pocock had publicly admitted that he 
was a citizen of Zimbabwe.  
The AEC and the decision-maker should also have found as a fact that objections had been made on this 
ground. 

The AEC should then have considered the implications of its findings of fact,  in particular, the AEC should 
have drawn Mr Pocock’s attention to the eligibility requirements and drawn his attention to the standard 
qualification check list for candidates. 

Also, as the fact of Mr Pocock’s public admission that he was a citizen of Zimbabwe was raised in the 
objections, this should not have been ignored in the decision-maker’s finding of facts. The decision-maker 
simply failed to make a relevant finding of fact. 

The AEC should not register as a party the name of a person who on his own admission is a citizen 
of  foreign country and therefore ineligible. The significance of registration of a name of a person who is 
inedible cannot just be ignored. 

The application can easily be cured by the applicant himself by lodging a fresh application if and when Mr 
Pocock has terminated citizenship of a foreign country and become eligible for election. 

This issue is not to be resolved not by ‘ticking boxes’ but by proper consideration of the scheme of the Act 
and the purposes and consequences of registration. On this correct approach to statutory interpretation, it 
is abundantly clear that registration of the name of a person who, on his own admission, and as drawn to 
attention in the objections to registration, is a citizen of a foreign country and therefore is ineligible, is 
contrary to the scheme of the Act and the consequences of registration. 

It follows that the application must be rejected.

Issue (2) The proposed name ‘David Pocock’ is not consistent with the concept of a party. 

The reasons for this objection are set out in more detail in the decision-maker’s summary of objections 
from Ernst, Neil and Lis. I adopt all those reasons in this objection-I think it is unnecessary to set them out 
in detail again but I ask that the AEC reviewer take account of all those reasons as summarised in the 
decision. 

Again the decision-maker has adopted a ‘ticking boxes’ approach without understanding the scheme and 
purpose of the Act. 

It must surely be obvious that an application to be registered as a party must satisfy the legal concept of 
‘party’. To explain this by analogy, if seeking to register a motor vehicle it is not possible to register a cat, 
because a cat is not a motor vehicle. Similarly, to register a party there must be something that satisfies 
the legal concept of a party. As a matter of common sense, a single person or the name of a person does 
not constitute a party. A party simply put is a body of persons united in some sort of cause or opinion or 
otherwise engaged together. These matters have been set out in greater length in the objections from 
Ernst, Neil and Lis set out in the decision. A party may incorporate the name of a person, so, for example, 
‘David Pocock for Canberra’ would satisfy the party concept. 

The error in the decision can be illustrated by drawing attention to the consequences for the ballot paper.  

If the application were allowed to stand the ballot paper would have David Pocock above the line, as a 
name.  

Electors wishing to vote ‘below the line’ would also find the name David Pocock below the line. 

Surely this outcome would be perverse. Surely the scheme object and purpose of the Act envisage that the 
identification ‘above the line’ must be different from the name that appears below the line.  

The consequential confusion and uncertainty is obvious. Some electors may tick David Pocock boxes both 
above and below the line, some may be confused about how to allocate preferences and so on.  

In short, what appears above the line and what appears below the line must surely be different. A party 
must be different from and more than just a name. 

I add that it is arguable that this outcome would give Mr Pocock an unfair advantage over other 
candidates, his name and his name on its own would appear twice on the ballot paper. 

The decision-maker has failed to have regard to the scheme of the Act and the consequences for the ballot 
paper. 

This difficulty can readily be rectified. It is not for objectors to assist the applicant on how to rectify the 
defect but just to show how easy the defect could be remedied I suggest that a party name along the lines 
of the proposed logo would suffice.  

It follows that the application must be rejected. The applicant should be invited to submit a fresh 
application with an appropriate party name. 

Yours sincerely

Mr Tom Rogers
Australian Electoral Commissioner
Locked Bag 4007, Canberra City ACT 2601
commission.secretariat@aec.gov.au

Dear Mr Rogers,

I am writing to request an urgent internal review of the AEC’s decision to deregister the Australian Progressives,
as notified in the letter received on the 16th of March.

When reading through the reasoning given for deregistration, it became clear that some sort of clerical error has
occurred with the validation of the second member list that was submitted on February 11th 2022. In the
Breakdown of the first member list submitted on December 8th, the AEC was able to match 1475 members. The
second member list submitted on February 11, was an amended version of that same list - with insufficient
amendments to justify a 1290 person drop in match rate - from 96% on the December 8 list, to 12% on the
February 11 list.

We also note that there is a more substantial breakdown of the December 8 list, with members being manually
matched, as well as the identification of 13 deceased members. The lack of a similar breakdown in the response
to our February 11 submission suggests that the process has not been followed with the same level of rigour.

It is apparent that some form of clerical error has occurred in the AEC’s assessment of our membership list which
was submitted on the 11th of February - there is no other reasonable explanation for such a significant drop in
the number of members matched to the electoral roll.

We request that this matter is addressed urgently as the Federal election is due to be called within weeks - and
this error has put our ability to contest the election at risk. In addition, the Party risks reputational damage as a
result of this error, so we would appreciate prompt action to resolve it.

We are confident that we have over the 1500 required members to remain registered, as a reflection of our
team’s dedication to cleaning the list and verifying information, and believe that investigation of this clerical
error will support this confidence.

Regards,

Edward Carroll

2608 \n\n31 March 2022 \n\nMr Tom Rogers \n Australian Electoral Commissioner \nLocked Bag 4007  \nCanberra City ACT 2601 \n\nBy email to: commission.secretariat@aec.gov.au \n\nDear Mr Rogers \n\nREQUEST FOR REVIEW OF DECISION \n\nPursuant to section 141(2) of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918, (the Electoral Act), we \nrequest a review of the decision on 4 March 2022 by the Delegate of the Commissioner, Joanne \nReid, to deregister the Democratic Labour Party (the DLP) under section 137(6)(a) of the Act. \n\nIn the first instance, it is of concern to us that amongst many small parties which have received \nNotices of Intent to Deregister, conservative Christian parties such as the DLP and the Christian \nDemocrats appear to have been singled out for quick deregistration while left-leaning secular \nparties such as \u201cDerryn Hinch\u2019s Justice Party\u201d which also received similar notices months before \nthe DLP continue to be registered. It is also of great concern to us that we appear to have been \ndenied natural justice in our efforts to comply with the minimum 1500 member requirement by \nbeing restricted to only providing 1650 names, by having only a tiny sample of these being \ncontacted by the Electoral Commission and then finally by being denied the opportunity to \nprovide any additional lists of members.\n\n\n--- Page 2 ---\n\nOn 27 January 2022 we received a letter from the AEC delegate, Joanne Reid, advising us of the \nintention to deregister the DLP. We were given a month to supply \u201ca statement, in writing, \nsetting out the reasons why the party should not be deregistered.\u201d \n\nShortly after this notice I, as registered officer, had a conversation with a member of the AEC \nwho rang me. I asked what we could include in the statement and was advised we could \nprovide any statement that would explain why we should not be deregistered. I twice asked \nwhether we \u201ccan we supply a new list of members\u201d and was advised the statement can contain \nanything that demonstrates why we should not be deregistered. The person I spoke with did \nnot refer to a new list or whether a new list could be supplied.  \n\nOn 26 February 2022, we submitted our statement setting out the reasons why we should not \nbe deregistered including the fact that we did have over 1500 members, The email we sent with \nthe statement specifically asked for permission to submit a new list of names and the \nstatement itself also specifically asked for permission to submit a new list of names.  \n\nWe now find that parties who never asked for permission were permitted to lodge new lists \nalong with their statement and those lists were accepted by the AEC. This despite no reference \nto supplying a new list being mentioned in the \u201cintention to deregister\u201d letter we received and \nno acknowledgment or suggestion that a new list could be lodged being mentioned in my \nphone conversation with the AEC, despite my specifically asking that question. \n\nAt the very least the AEC, who are happy to call and advise us that we are being deregistered, \ncould have called and said a new list would be accepted if supplied within 24 hours. I am \nseriously concerned about impartiality in the AEC when some parties were permitted to lodge a \nnew list supposedly without permission while those who sought permission were ignored, to \ntheir detriment.  \n\nInstead of acting on the request contained in the DLP\u2019s statement and email, the statement \nseems to have been given priority for denial, because barely four business days later we \nreceived the notice of \u2018Intention to Deregister.\u2019 Meanwhile, the \u201cDerryn Hinch Justice Party\u201d \nwhich was listed for deregistration on 17 December 2021, the Health Australia Party which was \nlisted on 18 January 2022 and the Australian Progressives which was listed on 11 January 2022 \nall remain on the list of registered parties.  \n\nI would suggest the least the AEC could do is to immediately restore the DLP to the list of \nRegistered Parties while examining the new list of members supplied with this appeal.\n\n\n--- Page 3 ---\n\nAttached to this statement is another list of 1650 members. As mentioned we request we be \nafforded the same treatment as other parties and our qualification for registration be \nimmediately re-established then re-assessed based on this list.   \n\nIn the Notice of Decision on Party Registration dated 4 March 2022, the Delegate, Joanne Reid, \nsimply asserts that she \u201crejects the reasons outlined by (the DLP) in its statement provided on \n26 February 2022\u201d including both the issue of the legal validity of the sampling process used to \nassess the membership number and the fact that the DLP advised that it has more membership \nnames which it was prevented from providing, without explaining how or why this \u201crejection\u201d is \ndecided upon.  The fact that the DLP requested permission to lodge another list of members in \nthe very statement the Delegate rejects while other parties, whom the same delegate would \npresumably have dealt with for deregistration purposes, were permitted to lodge new lists \napparently without permission seems to be unfair and suggests the Delegates reasons for \nrejection of our statement are inconsistent with her or the AEC\u2019s actions. \n\nMs Reid declares that she \u201cremain(s) satisfied that the (DLP) does not have 1500 members\u201d \ndespite the fact that we have advised that we have more than the maximum 1650 sample we \nwere permitted to provide, so it is not clear how the Delegate would arrive at this prejudicial \nconclusion when it appears to be at odds with all available facts. \n\nThe use of a sample of only 42 members to draw conclusions regarding the membership status \nof 1572 members would appear to be questionable from the standpoints of both procedural \nfairness and legal validity. In the Notice, the Delegate declares that her faith in the validity of \nthis approach derives from the fact that the Electoral Commission \u201chas previously concluded \nthat the methodology was appropriate for membership testing because it was rational, fair and \npractical in all the circumstances,\u201d however her own organization\u2019s endorsement of its own \nprocess is an entirely circular justification and provides no credibility whatsoever. In fact, from a \nstatistical standpoint, a parametric estimate of valid membership numbers using such a tiny \nsample must have a huge standard error and so can only logically be regarded as indicative \nrather than definitive. \n\nMoreover, the Delegate\u2019s statement that she considers that a statistical estimate \u201cprovide(s) a \nmore robust method for ascertaining whether a party has satisfied the requirements of the \nElectoral Act than a statement by the party\u201d appears disingenuous.  \n\nWe did not, nor obviously would anyone else, seriously suggest that an assertion of \nmembership numbers had any weight in assessing eligibility for registration. We merely pointed\n\n\n--- Page 4 ---\n\nout that we had additional members which we could have provided if we had been told that we \nwere allowed to do so. \n\nIn fact, the key question that we raised was neither this nor whether the ABS provided \nestimation method was an effective indicative tool, but rather whether statistical extrapolation \nfrom a sample of only 42 members could be a fair and valid method to decide definitively that a \nparty which supplied 1650 member names did not have 1500 members. \n\nThe DLP would contend that the only way to definitively assess whether a party has the \nminimum 1500 members required by the amended Electoral Act is for the AEC to contact each \nand all of the members provided.  \n\nWhile this may be a major task for the AEC, given that rejection of a party\u2019s claim to the \nrequired membership denies it the right to participate in our nation\u2019s democratic processes, we \nsubmit respectfully that the AEC\u2019s convenience should not be the primary consideration. \n\nAs set out in the Administrative Review Council\u2019s Best Practice Guide to Decision Making, an \nimportant legal requirement in any administrative decision making is to conform to the \nprinciples of natural justice, to the extent that \u201cnatural justice generally applies whenever a \nstatute gives power to make an administrative decision that might adversely effects the rights, \ninterests or legitimate expectations of an individual or organization.\u201d1  Moreover, as the guide \nmakes clear, \u201cthe requirement of natural justice comes from general administrative law, not \nthe particular statue being administered\u201d2 and these obligations for administrative decision \nmakers are reflected in the Australian Public Service Values and Code of Conduct set down in \nthe Australian Public Service Commissioner\u2019s Directions 2016 and the Public Service Act 1999.      \n\nThe wording of the Delegate\u2019s written decision suggests to us that she may have been \nunfamiliar with these obligations. \n\nIn conclusion, the grounds upon which we request review of the Delegate\u2019s decision are \n\n1.  That in not being advised that we were allowed to submit additional names as part of \n\nour statement on 26 February 2022 as other parties did, we were denied natural justice \nin the decision making process; \n\n1 Administrative Review Council Best Practice Guide 2, \u201cDecision Making: Natural Justice\u201d, 2007, p4 \n2 Ibid, p5\n\n\n--- Page 5 ---\n\n2.  That in not responding to our request for permission to lodge a new list of names, as \n\ncontained in both our email and statement of 26 February 2022, the DLP was denied the \nability to demonstrate our eligibility to registration as was granted to numerous other \nparties; \n\n3.  That the means of statistical extrapolation by which the minimum membership is \n\ndetermined is neither \u201cfair\u201d nor \u201crobust\u201d but merely indicative and therefore does not \ncomply with the AEC\u2019s legal obligations to definitively determine eligibility for \nregistration under the Electoral Act; \n\n4.  That because the AEC failed to contact 1530 of the 1650 members we supplied, the AEC \n\ndenied us a just and equitable assessment of our membership; and \n\n5.  That wording of the Delegate\u2019s written response suggests an apprehended bias against \n\nus and raises the possibility that we were not afforded an objective assessment. \n\nAccordingly we request that our registration be immediately re-established while our ongoing \nentitlement to registration is re-assessed by the Commission, including an assessment of the \nnew list of 1650 member names which we attach.  \n\nYours sincerely \n\nStephen Campbell \nFederal Secretary and Registered Officer \nDemocratic Labour Party"}, {"type": "pdf", "output_file_path":

Do not click links or open \nattachments unless you recognise the sender and know the content is safe. \n\nTo: Mr Tom Rogers \nvia email: commission.secretariat@aec.gov.au \n\nHi, \n\nThis is an application under s 141(2) of the EA to review the decision to deregister Health Australia Party (HAP) [1]. \n\nI learned of HAP's deregistration on the 14th of April. \n\nAs a voter I am affected by the wrongful deregistration of political parties and I am concerned that the AEC's \nprocesses are inadequate. Thus I am concerned that wrongful deregistrations have occurred many times and are \ncontinuing to occur -- HAP being just one example of more than a do en. \n\nParticularly: I do not believe the AEC's membership testing method is accurate enough to support the decision. \n\nThis is because, based on the statistics gathered and published by the AEC in [1], the AEC's method had a false \nnegative rate of 72.34% \u00b1 0.12% if HAP has > 1769 members. That is, *if* HAP has > 1769 members, *then* it is \nexpected that the AEC's method has that false negative rate. \n\nThe number 1769 is important because, based on the data gathered by the AEC, *if* HAP could have submitted \n1769 members then they would have passed this hypothetical membership test. (Note, there is no mathematical \nreason that the membership test methodology could not simply allow longer lists; the only restriction is *AEC policy \nalone*.) \n\nHAP's Nov 2021 membe ship test had a false negative rate of 72.40% \u00b1 0.12% if HAP has > 1769 members. \n\nThis means that, if HAP has more than 1769 members (which would imply they are an eligible party), that the \nprobability that HAP passed either the first test or failed the first but passed the second was only 0.476 -- i.e., 47.6%. \nThat's worse odds than a coin flip. \n\nS nce the AEC, *by the Commission's own policy,* does not allow a party to submit more than 1650 members as \npart of the test methodology, there is no way -- by the best known principles of statistics and the philosophy of \nscience available to us -- that the AEC can be statistically confident in the results of the membership test \nmethodology, and thus the Commission does not have statistical grounds for the decision to deregister. This is \nespecially poignant considering that HAP claims to have ~4,000 members nationally [1]. Considering the AEC's \nmeasurements to-date, it is reasonable to expect that HAP could produce an additional 129 members unless \nevidence can be produced to contradict this. The membership testing method does not gather such evidence -- and \nparties are forbidden from submitting additional members -- so it is a mystery how the AEC would have such \nevidence. In fact, if the lists that HAP submitted to the AEC have fewer than 1521 overlapping members, HAP has \n\n1\n\nLEX3070 Released Document No. 6Released under the Freedom of Information Act 198210\n\n\n--- Page 2 ---\n\nalready proven to the AEC that it does have sufficient membership. \n\nHow many members were on both lists submitted by HAP? \n\nGiven the above, I request that the decision to deregister HAP be set aside. \n\nAs evidence of my claims, please see [2] -- particularly Fig 6.6 which is the results of the statistical analysis of HAP's \nFeb 2022 membership test. (A link to the results of the analysis of HAP's Nov 2021 membership test are linked in Fig \n6.6's description.) \n\nAdditionally, I note that the AEC has made trivial mistakes in the documentation and execution of the method (see \n[3]), so I have no faith that those employees or delegates of the Commission that execute the method have any idea \nwhatsoever about how to do it correctly, what the requirements for statistical validity are, or how to check that they \nare not making a mistake. \n\nThus, the Commission should also reconsider their entire testing framework, setting aside all decisions to deregister \nor refuse registration on the basis of the results of the testing method until such a time when the Commission \nobtains the relevant skills necessary to develop a method that is not predetermined  n some cases. I can't request \nthat under s 141(2); it's just my opinion. Seems worth mentioning, though. \n\nMax Kaye \n\n[1]: \nhttps://www.aec.gov.au/Parties and Representatives/Party Registration/Deregistered

The three principal reasons for making this application \nare: \n\n1.    1.  The method used by the AEC to determine our eligibility \n\nis not legislated, and we have been advised would not withstand a legal \nchallenge. We have been advised that the direction to submit a list of only \n1,650 members is not legislated. We believe that we should have been allowed to \nsubmit our full member list of around 3,000 members and allow either the AEC to \n\n2\n\n10LEX3070 Released Document No. 7Released under the Freedom of Information Act 1982\n\n\n--- Page 3 ---\n\ndemonstrate that we did not have 1,500 members or, conversely allow that list \nto demonstrate we did have more than 1,500 members. \n\n2.    2.  We understand that the 36 members you identified \n\nas supporting the registration of another Party were not contacted to inquire \nif they wished to be considered as members of the HAP, or the other Party, \nmeaning that some probably should have been included in our audit. \n\n3.      \n\n3. Unfairness: The AEC denied our \nrequest, as a nationally registered Party, to access the ELIAS database for \nevery State and Territory to allow us to confirm that members were correctly \nenrolled on the electoral rolls. We were only given access to the Victorian \ndatabase. This materially restricted our ability to correct our national roll \n(which we had, prior to the second submission, reduced from around 4,000 \nmembers to around 3,000 members). That would have meant that the 5 deceased \nmembers and the 16 members not able to be matched to the electoral roll would \nnot have been included in our list, and we would have had the opportunity to supply you with a more \naccurate list. \n\nMr Aldridge advised us that other issues could be raised, \nbut we believe that the three above issues alone warrant a review and overturning \nof the decision that the HAP does not have 1,500 members. If, as part of your \nreview, we are required to submit our complete list of members, we would first \nrequest that we be given access to the full ELIAS database so that we can prune \nany deceased or unenrolled people from our list of 3,000. We believe even a further severe pruning would \ndemonstrate we have over 2,500 current members. \n\nWe appreciate your consideration of our submission, including your advice as to our current status regarding the \nelection which has not yet been called. \n\nYours sincerely, \n\nDr Isaac \nGolden \n\nNational Secretary \n\nHealth Australia Party \n\n3\n\nLEX3070 Released Document No. 7Released under the Freedom of Information Act 1982\n\n\n--- Page 4 ---\n\nPersonal email: \n\nHAP email:  executive@healthaustraliaparty.com.au \n\n7th April, 2022 \n\nDISCLAIMER: \n\nIf you have received this transmission in error please notify us immediately by return email and delete all copies.

I believe those documents may inform my internal review \nrequest.  \n\nI am conscious of the public interest in resolving this matter quickly and I have requested expeditious \nprocessing of my FOI application. I had hoped that the AEC would recognise the public interest in speedy \nresolution of internal review requests and would process the related FOI request speedily. I am therefore \ndisappointed that my FOI request has still not been determined.  I seek your agreement to my \nsupplementing this internal review request when the response to my FOI application is received. \n\nIt is apparent from reading the decision to register the David Pocock Party that the decision-maker has \ntaken an extraordinarily narrow approach to statutory interpretation. The decision-maker has followed a \n\u2018ticking boxes\u2019 approach without consideration of the scheme of the legislation or its purpose. Also, \nnotwithstanding a heading \u2018Findings of Fact and Consideration\u2019 the decision-maker has failed to make a \nfinding of fact in relation to a key factual issue raised in the objections.  \n\nIt follows that the decision is fundamentally flawed. \n\nTwo key issues were raised in the objections to the application to register the David Pocock Party. \n\nIssue (1)-that at the time of the application for registration it was clear from interviews published in the \nmedia including in the major ACT daily newspaper the Canberra Times that Mr David Pocock has publicly \nadmitted that he was a citizen of a foreign country, Zimbabwe, and therefore ineligible for the Senate. \n\nThis public admission is a serious question of fact. \n\n1\n\nLEX3070 Released Document No. 81019Released under the Freedom of Information Act 1982\n\n\n--- Page 2 ---\n\n31. \n\n32. \n\n33. \n\n34. \n\n35. \n\n36. \n\n37. \n\n38. \n\nBusiness information (information having a commercial value that would be, \nor could reasonably be expected to be, destroyed or diminished if the \ninformation were disclosed). \n\nLegal Professional Communication redacted. \n\nDeliberative material redacted. \n\nElectoral Roll material redacted. \n\nTests, examinations or audits material redacted. \n\nManagement or assessment of personnel material redacted. \n\nProper and efficient conduct of the operations of AEC material redacted. \n\nLawful methods or procedures for preventing, detecting, investigating, or \ndealing with matters arising out of, breaches or evasions of the law redactged \n\n39. \n\nIrrelevant material redacted.\n\n\n--- Page 3 ---\n\nThe decision-maker has failed to make a relevant finding of fact.  \n\nIt was necessary for the decision-maker first to make a relevant finding of fact relating to matters raised in \nthe objections then to set out reasons in relation to the legal significance of that finding of fact. \n\nThe purpose of registration is to enable \u2018above the line\u2019 voting. Registration that would facilitate \u2018election\u2019 \nof a candidate not lawfully eligible would clearly be contrary to the scheme of the Act. \n\nThe AEC will be aware that before the last election the AEC failed to establish proper eligibility procedures, \nas a result of this procedural failure on the part of the AEC persons who were ineligible nominated, \nelection of a number of persons were subsequently overturned by the High Court on the foreign \ncitizenship issue. Some regard the AEC as having failed properly to perform its functions eg properly \ndrawing attention to the legal requirements to be eligible to nominate. \n\nThe AEC should not in effect mislead the Australian public by registering as a party the name of a person \nwho at the time of the application for registration on his own admission was not eligible for election. \n\nI emphasise that my submission is not that the AEC should itself determine eligibility. That is not the AEC\u2019s \nfunction. My submission is that, Mr Pocock having publicly admitted that he was a citizen of Zimbabwe, \nthe AEC should not have ignored the consequences when determining the registration application. \n\nAs a minimum, having regard to Mr Pocock\u2019s public admission that he was a citizen of Zimbabwe, and \nhaving regard to objections raising this issue, certain consequences should have been followed. \n\nThe AEC and the decision-maker should have found as a fact that Mr Pocock had publicly admitted that he \nwas a citizen of Zimbabwe.  \nThe AEC and the decision-maker should also have found as a fact that objections had been made on this \nground. \n\nThe AEC should then have considered the implications of its findings of fact,  in particular, the AEC should \nhave drawn Mr Pocock\u2019s attention to the eligibility requirements and drawn his attention to the standard \nqualification check list for candidates. \n\nAlso, as the fact of Mr Pocock\u2019s public admission that he was a citizen of Zimbabwe was raised in the \nobjections, this should not have been ignored in the decision-maker\u2019s finding of facts. The decision-maker \nsimply failed to make a relevant finding of fact. \n\nThe AEC should not register as a party the name of a person who on his own admission is a citizen \nof  foreign country and therefore ineligible. The significance of registration of a name of a person who is \ninedible cannot just be ignored. \n\nThe application can easily be cured by the applicant himself by lodging a fresh application if and when Mr \nPocock has terminated citizenship of a foreign country and become eligible for election. \n\nThis issue is not to be resolved not by \u2018ticking boxes\u2019 but by proper consideration of the scheme of the Act \nand the purposes and consequences of registration. On this correct approach to statutory interpretation, it \nis abundantly clear that registration of the name of a person who, on his own admission, and as drawn to \nattention in the objections to registration, is a citizen of a foreign country and therefore is ineligible, is \ncontrary to the scheme of the Act and the consequences of registration. \n\nIt follows that the application must be rejected. \n\n2\n\nLEX3070 Released Document No. 8Released under the Freedom of Information Act 1982\n\n\n--- Page 4 ---\n\nIssue (2) The proposed name \u2018David Pocock\u2019 is not consistent with the concept of a party. \n\nThe reasons for this objection are set out in more detail in the decision-maker\u2019s summary of objections \nfrom Ernst, Neil and Lis. I adopt all those reasons in this objection-I think it is unnecessary to set them out \nin detail again but I ask that the AEC reviewer take account of all those reasons as summarised in the \ndecision. \n\nAgain the decision-maker has adopted a \u2018ticking boxes\u2019 approach without understanding the scheme and \npurpose of the Act. \n\nIt must surely be obvious that an application to be registered as a party must satisfy the legal concept of \n\u2018party\u2019. To explain this by analogy, if seeking to register a motor vehicle it is not possible to register a cat, \nbecause a cat is not a motor vehicle. Similarly, to register a party there must be something that satisfies \nthe legal concept of a party. As a matter of common sense, a single person or the name of a person does \nnot constitute a party. A party simply put is a body of persons united in some sort of cause or opinion or \notherwise engaged together. These matters have been set out in greater length in the objections from \nErnst, Neil and Lis set out in the decision. A party may incorporate the name of a person, so, for example, \n\u2018David Pocock for Canberra\u2019 would satisfy the party concept. \n\nThe error in the decision can be illustrated by drawing attention to the consequences for the ballot paper.  \n\nIf the application were allowed to stand the ballot paper would have David Pocock above the line, as a \nname.  \n\nElectors wishing to vote \u2018below the line\u2019 would also find the name David Pocock below the line. \n\nSurely this outcome would be perverse. Surely the scheme object and purpose of the Act envisage that the \nidentification \u2018above the line\u2019 must be different from the name that appears below the line.  \n\nThe consequential confusion and uncertainty is obvious. Some electors may tick David Pocock boxes both \nabove and below the line, some may be confused about how to allocate preferences and so on.  \n\nIn short, what appears above the line and what appears below the line must surely be different. A party \nmust be different from and more than just a name. \n\nI add that it is arguable that this outcome would give Mr Pocock an unfair advantage over other \ncandidates, his name and his name on its own would appear twice on the ballot paper. \n\nThe decision-maker has failed to have regard to the scheme of the Act and the consequences for the ballot \npaper. \n\nThis difficulty can readily be rectified. It is not for objectors to assist the applicant on how to rectify the \ndefect but just to show how easy the defect could be remedied I suggest that a party name along the lines \nof the proposed logo would suffice.  \n\nIt follows that the application must be rejected. The applicant should be invited to submit a fresh \napplication with an appropriate party name. \n\nYours sincerely \n\n3\n\nLEX3070 Released Document No. 8Released under the Freedom of Information Act 1982\n\n\n--- Page 5 ---\n\n11 April 2022 \n\n4\n\nLEX3070 Released Document No. 81Released under the Freedom of Information Act 1982\n\n\n--- Page 6 ---\n\n1. \n\n2. \n\n3. \n\n4. \n\n5. \n\n6. \n\n7. \n\n8. \n\n9. \n\n10. \n\n11. \n\n12. \n\n13. \n\n14. \n\n15. \n\n16. \n\n17. \n\n18. \n\n19. \n\n20. \n\n21. \n\n22. \n\n23. \n\n24. \n\n25. \n\n26. \n\n27. \n\n28. \n\n29. \n\nREDACTION CODES \n\nPersonal Information (name) redacted. \n\nPersonal Information (date of birth) redacted. \n\nPersonal Information (place of birth) redacted \n\nPersonal Information (citizenship) redacted. \n\nPersonal Information (racial or ethnic origin) redacted. \n\nPersonal Information (photograph) redacted \n\nPersonal Information (facsimile of signature) redacted. \n\nPersonal Information (facsimile of manuscript initialling) redacted. \n\nPersonal Information (Individual\u2019s address) redacted. \n\nPersonal Information (Individual\u2019s email address) redacted. \n\nPersonal Information (individual\u2019s telephone number or mobile number) \nredacted. \n\nPersonal Information (individual\u2019s political opinion) redacted. \n\nPersonal Information (opinion about individual) redacted. \n\nPersonal Information (Individuals current or former occupation). \n\nPersonal Information (employment history) redacted. \n\nPersonal Information (qualifications) redacted. \n\nPersonal Information (membership of a professional or trade association). \n\nPersonal Information (membership of a trade union). \n\nPersonal Information (health) redacted. \n\nPersonal Information (membership of a political association) redacted \n\nPersonal Information (religious beliefs or affiliations) redacted. \n\nPersonal Information (sexual orientation or practices). \n\nPersonal Information (criminal record). \n\nPersonal Information (identifying individual) redacted. \n\nPersonal Information (bank account details) redacted) \n\nBusiness information (bank account details) redacted. \n\nBusiness information (billing account details) redacted. \n\nBusiness information (ureasonably affect a person adversely in respect of his \nor her lawful business or professional affairs) redacted. \n\nBusiness Information (reasonably be expected to prejudice the future supply \nof information to the Commonwealth or an agency for the purpose of the \nadministration of a law of the Commonwealth or of a Territory or the \nadministration of matters administered by an agency). \n\n30. \n\nBusiness information (trade secret)."}, {"type": "pdf", "output_file_path": "/downloaded_originals/LEX3070 Released Document No. 9.pdf", "content_files": [], "extracted_text_path": "/extracted_texts/LEX3070_LEX3070 Released Document No. 9.txt", "ai_summaries": {"balanced": {"needs_summary": true, "source_hash": "1814d80007d557d80f9692e772be2823a7b82cd6765c373e6c82faa5b5720bbb"}, "left_leaning": {"needs_summary": true, "source_hash": "1814d80007d557d80f9692e772be2823a7b82cd6765c373e6c82faa5b5720bbb"}, "right_leaning": {"needs_summary": true, "source_hash": "1814d80007d557d80f9692e772be2823a7b82cd6765c373e6c82faa5b5720bbb"}, "government_skeptic": {"needs_summary": true, "source_hash": "1814d80007d557d80f9692e772be2823a7b82cd6765c373e6c82faa5b5720bbb"}, "government_apologist": {"needs_summary": true, "source_hash": "1814d80007d557d80f9692e772be2823a7b82cd6765c373e6c82faa5b5720bbb"}, "highly_critical": {"needs_summary": true, "source_hash": "1814d80007d557d80f9692e772be2823a7b82cd6765c373e6c82faa5b5720bbb"}}, "filename": "LEX3070 Released Document No. 9.pdf", "download_path": "/foi_assets/LEX3070/LEX3070 Released Document No. 9.pdf", "extracted_text": "\n\n--- Page 1 ---\n\nMr Tom Rogers\nAustralian Electoral Commissioner\nLocked Bag 4007, Canberra City ACT 2601\ncommission.secretariat@aec.gov.au\n\nDear Mr Rogers,\n\nI am writing to request an urgent internal review of the AEC\u2019s decision to deregister the Australian Progressives,\nas notified in the letter received on the 16th of March.\n\nWhen reading through the reasoning given for deregistration, it became clear that some sort of clerical error has\noccurred with the validation of the second member list that was submitted on February 11th 2022.

The lack of a similar breakdown in the response\nto our February 11 submission suggests that the process has not been followed with the same level of rigour.\n\nIt is apparent that some form of clerical error has occurred in the AEC\u2019s assessment of our membership list which\nwas submitted on the 11th of February - there is no other reasonable explanation for such a significant drop in\nthe number of members matched to the electoral roll.\n\nWe request that this matter is addressed urgently as the Federal election is due to be called within weeks - and\nthis error has put our ability to contest the election at risk. In addition, the Party risks reputational damage as a\nresult of this error, so we would appreciate prompt action to resolve it.\n\nWe are confident that we have over the 1500 required members to remain registered, as a reflection of our\nteam\u2019s dedication to cleaning the list and verifying information, and believe that investigation of this clerical\nerror will support this confidence.\n\nRegards,\n\nEdward Carroll\nRegistered Officer\nAustralian Progressives\n42 Messara Circuit\nDURACK QLD 4077\n\nedward.carroll@progressives.org.au\n\nwww.progressives.org.au\n\nLEX3070

Request\n\nThe main purpose of the Freedom of Information (FOI) request (LEX3070) was to obtain \"all applications made to the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) under s 141 (2) of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 during the year 2022 prior to 21st June 2022.\" Section 141(2) of the Act pertains to requests for review of decisions made by the Electoral Commission, typically concerning the registration or deregistration of political parties.\n\n### Documents from the FOI Request\n\nThe released documents include:\n\n*   A \"Schedule of Published Documents\" outlining nine items related to the FOI request.\n*   Various communications, primarily emails and letters, from political parties or individuals to the AEC. These communications mostly constitute formal requests for review of AEC decisions under s 141(2) or related objections.\n*   One detailed statistical analysis report, \"AEC Party Membership Test Methodology is Rigged! A Statistical Analysis of AEC Methodology and Graphs (of PMFs),\" submitted as part of a review request by the Flux party.\n*   Standard redaction codes outlining reasons for information withholding (e.g., personal information, business information, legal professional communication).\n\n### Main Content from FOI Request Documents\n\nThe core content of the released documents revolves around challenges to the Australian Electoral Commission's decisions regarding party registration and deregistration, primarily focusing on the methodology for assessing party membership.\n\n**1. Challenges to AEC's Membership Testing Methodology (Common Theme):**\n\nSeveral parties, including the **Democratic Labour Party (DLP)**, **VOTEFLUX.ORG | Upgrade Democracy! (Flux)**, and the **Health Australia Party (HAP)**, submitted requests for review of their deregistration, predominantly arguing that the AEC's statistical methodology for verifying party membership is flawed and unfair.\n\n*   **Arguments raised by DLP, Flux, and HAP:**\n    *   **Statistical Validity:** They contend that the AEC's sampling method (e.g., testing only a small sample of members) is unreliable and does not definitively prove a party's membership numbers. Flux provided extensive statistical analysis by Max Kaye, arguing that the methodology has a high \"false negative\" rate (over 99.99% for Flux in a hypothetical scenario where it met the membership threshold) and that its outcomes are \"predetermined\" and \"rigged.\"\n    *   **Membership List Limits:** Parties criticized the AEC's policy of limiting the number of members a party can submit for verification (e.g., 1650 members), arguing it prevents them from demonstrating their true membership numbers (e.g., Flux claimed 4,680 members, HAP claimed 3,000-4,000 members). They argue this policy is not legislated and unduly disadvantages parties.\n    *   **Procedural Fairness:** Claims of denial of natural justice were made, including:\n        *   AEC ignoring requests to submit additional member lists while allegedly permitting other parties to do so without explicit permission (DLP).\n        *   AEC's selective sampling (e.g., Flux alleged the AEC sampled only from the top 1,650 names alphabetically, excluding many members).\n        *   Denial of access to comprehensive electoral roll databases (ELIAS) for parties to accurately prune their member lists (HAP).\n        *   Allegations of \"apprehended bias\" against certain party types (DLP).\n*   **Consequences and Historical Context:** The statistical analysis by Max Kaye further suggests that the AEC's methodology, combined with changes in electoral law (e.g., increasing required members from 500 to 1500), has \"systemically disadvantaged non-parliamentary parties\" and acted as a tool for \"eliminating competition.\" It identifies several historical cases as \"suspected\" or \"possible farces\" where the AEC's testing method likely had a very low accuracy rate.\n\n**2. Suspected Clerical Error (Australian Progressives):**\n\n*   The **Australian Progressives** requested an urgent internal review of their deregistration, alleging a \"clerical error\" in the AEC's assessment of their membership. They noted a drastic and inexplicable drop in their membership match rate between two submitted lists (from 96% to 12%), which they believe was not justified by amendments made to the list.\n\n**3. Objection to Party Registration (David Pocock Party):**\n\n*   An individual requested an internal review of the AEC's decision to *register* the **David Pocock party**. The objections were based on two main grounds:\n    *   **Candidate Eligibility:** David Pocock's public admission of foreign (Zimbabwean) citizenship, arguing that registering a party named after an individual ineligible for election is contrary to the Commonwealth Electoral Act's purpose and could mislead the public.\n    *   **Party Name Consistency:** The name \"David Pocock\" was deemed inconsistent with the legal concept of a \"party,\" which should represent a collective rather than an individual. Concerns were raised about potential confusion on ballot papers and an unfair advantage for the candidate.\n\n**4. Objection to Party Logo (Australian Federation Party):**\n\n*   An individual objected to the proposed logo for the **Australian Federation Party**. The concern was that a \"tick\" symbol within the logo could be misinterpreted by voters as a mark for the ballot box, potentially leading to invalidated votes. (Note: While included in the released documents, this is an objection to a logo under s 134(6)(c), not a s 141(2) review of a registration/deregistration decision.)\n\nIn summary, the documents reveal a strong theme of challenges to the AEC's administrative processes, particularly its membership verification methodology, with parties arguing that the methods are statistically flawed, procedurally unfair, and lead to arbitrary or predetermined deregistration outcomes.", "model": "gemini-2.5-flash", "generated_at": "2025-06-22T14:00:11.033091", "source_hash": "69f919acff14109a25c38d41674ae607a42fc20be91a054d7510844d5633adca", "raw_response_path": "data/llm_responses/LEX3070__overall__balanced__20250622T140010.json", "output_tokens": 1272, "prompt_tokens": 38402, "total_tokens": 43998, "summary_length": 5936}, "short_index": {"text": "The FOI request (LEX3070) sought applications made to the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) under s 141(2) of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 during early 2022, concerning reviews of party registration and deregistration decisions.

From a left-leaning perspective, these documents highlight significant concerns regarding the fairness, accessibility, and integrity of Australia's democratic processes, raising red flags related to social justice, corporate influence, and civil liberties.\n\n**Key Issues and Progressive Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Barriers to Democratic Participation and Civil Liberties:**\n    *   **Increased Membership Threshold and Lack of Grace Period:** Multiple parties (Democratic Labour Party, Flux, Health Australia Party, Australian Progressives) are struggling with the recent increase in the minimum membership requirement from 500 to 1,500. This legislative change, implemented without a grace period, is perceived as an arbitrary barrier, disproportionately impacting smaller, non-parliamentary parties. This directly deviates from progressive values of inclusive democracy and fair participation, as it stifles new and diverse political voices, which often originate from grassroots movements.\n    *   **Flawed and Biased Membership Testing Methodology:** This is the most critical issue raised. Documents from Flux and Health Australia Party, particularly Flux's extensive statistical analysis, assert that the AEC's membership verification method is \"faulty,\" \"inaccurate,\" \"unreliable,\" and effectively \"rigged.\"\n        *   **High False-Negative Rates:** The analysis demonstrates that the AEC's method frequently produces \"false negatives,\" meaning eligible parties with sufficient members are wrongly deregistered (e.g., Flux claims a 71.7% false-negative rate for its own test, and up to 99.998% for hypothetical eligible parties). This undermines the fundamental civil liberty of free association and the right to participate in the political process via party registration.\n        *   **Arbitrary Limits and Lack of Transparency:** Parties argue that the AEC's policy limiting submitted membership lists to 1,650 names, even when they possess thousands more, is unlegislated and unfair. The AEC's refusal to allow parties to replace filtered members (due to duplicates, deceased, etc.) or to grant full access to electoral roll data for list cleaning further exacerbates this. This lack of transparency and an opaque process are antithetical to progressive demands for open and accountable governance.\n        *   **Allegations of Bias:** The Democratic Labour Party explicitly claims \"conservative Christian parties\" like theirs were \"singled out for quick deregistration\" while \"left-leaning secular parties\" allegedly remained registered, though they do not provide evidence for this specific bias, their broader critique of unfair process resonates with concerns about social justice in electoral administration.\n\n2.  **Entrenchment of the Status Quo and Corporate Influence (Implicit):**\n    *   The consistent theme across the appeals is that the AEC's policies and the recent legislative changes are serving to \"cull\" smaller parties and \"entrench the status quo\" of major parties. From a progressive viewpoint, this creates an unlevel playing field, making it harder for emergent movements, independent voices, or parties advocating for environmental protection, wealth redistribution, or other social justice reforms to gain traction. This systemic bias implicitly benefits established interests, including potentially corporate influence, by limiting political competition and the diversity of policy debates.\n    *   Flux explicitly notes that building and maintaining large membership lists is \"expensive, time consuming, and difficult to manage,\" implying that smaller parties with fewer resources are at a disadvantage, unless they, like Flux, develop \"significant automation\" for member management, which is \"too involved, expensive, and specialized for it to be practical for most political parties.\" This speaks to an indirect form of wealth-based exclusion in the political sphere.\n\n3.  **Government Accountability and Trust in Institutions:**\n    *   The detailed statistical critiques, particularly by Max Kaye from Flux, accuse the AEC of enforcing a \"rigged\" method and ignoring \"reason, or logic, or statistical arguments.\" The AEC's dismissal of these critiques, often by citing its own internal validations, reveals a lack of responsiveness and accountability that directly contradicts progressive expectations for public institutions. The David Pocock Party objection, while different in nature, also critiques the AEC for taking an \"extraordinarily narrow approach to statutory interpretation\" and failing to make key factual findings, further eroding trust in the AEC's impartiality and competence.\n\nIn summary, these FOI documents paint a concerning picture from a left-leaning perspective, suggesting that government actions and electoral policies, ostensibly aimed at maintaining \"electoral integrity,\" are in practice creating significant barriers to democratic participation, disproportionately disadvantaging smaller, non-parliamentary parties, and entrenching the power of established political elites. This represents a significant deviation from progressive values of civil liberties, social justice, and fair, transparent, and representative democracy.", "model": "gemini-2.5-flash", "generated_at": "2025-06-22T14:00:39.254667", "source_hash": "69f919acff14109a25c38d41674ae607a42fc20be91a054d7510844d5633adca", "raw_response_path": "data/llm_responses/LEX3070__overall__left_leaning__20250622T140039.json", "output_tokens": 1007, "prompt_tokens": 38393, "total_tokens": 41612, "summary_length": 5416}, "short_index": {"text": "The Freedom of Information documents regarding 2022 deregistration reviews by the Australian Electoral Commission raise significant left-leaning concerns about the integrity and fairness of Australia's democratic processes.

Analyzing these through a conservative lens, several deviations from core principles of economic efficiency, individual liberty, fiscal responsibility, and limited government are apparent.\n\n**Economic Efficiency and Fiscal Responsibility:**\nThe documents repeatedly highlight the AEC's use of a membership testing methodology that is criticized as \"faulty,\" \"inaccurate,\" \"unreliable,\" and \"unsuitable.\" The Flux party's detailed statistical analysis (Document 4, 6) strongly suggests this method leads to a high rate of \"false negatives,\" effectively deregistering eligible parties. If a government process consistently produces incorrect outcomes, it is inherently inefficient. Parties expend significant resources to maintain membership lists and comply with regulations, only to be subjected to a \"rigged\" test that is described as a \"farce.\" This represents a considerable waste of private resources and taxpayer money, as appeals and re-tests become necessary, and legitimate political organizations are forced to fight administrative incompetence rather than engaging in the democratic process. The claim that the AEC's \"trivial mistakes in the documentation and execution\" (Document 6) further underscores a lack of fiscal discipline and operational efficiency within the agency.\n\n**Individual Liberty:**\nThe core function of an electoral commission in a free society is to facilitate, not hinder, political participation. The documents present multiple instances where AEC actions appear to curtail individual liberty and the freedom of association.\n*   **Arbitrary Barriers:** The Democratic Labour Party (DLP) (Document 3) and Flux (Document 4, 6) both challenge the AEC's strict limit of 1650 members for validation, arguing it is \"not legislated\" and prevents them from demonstrating their full membership, which for some parties numbers in the thousands. This constitutes an arbitrary administrative barrier that restricts political organization and participation.\n*   **Unequal Treatment:** The DLP alleges a \"singling out\" of \"conservative Christian parties\" for quick deregistration compared to \"left-leaning secular parties,\" suggesting a potential ideological bias that undermines the principle of equal treatment under the law and fair political competition (Document 3).\n*   **Denial of Natural Justice:** Both the DLP (Document 3) and Health Australia Party (HAP) (Document 7) claim denial of natural justice, citing restrictions on providing additional member lists or access to necessary databases (ELIAS) to verify member details. This hinders parties' ability to comply and participate, infringing on their liberty to organize effectively.\n\n**Limited Government:**\nA foundational conservative principle is that government should be limited in scope and operate strictly within its legislative mandate. These documents raise serious questions about AEC overreach and lack of accountability.\n*   **Bureaucratic Overreach:** The claim that the AEC imposes policies, such as the 1650-member limit, that are \"not legislated\" (Document 7) is a direct challenge to the concept of limited government. It suggests an unelected bureaucracy is creating rules beyond the explicit will of the legislature, thereby exercising undue power.\n*   **Lack of Accountability and Competence:** The detailed statistical analysis from Flux, asserting the AEC's method \"fails more than 99% of the time\" for eligible parties and that the agency uses a \"typo\" in its testing table for years (Document 4), points to a severe lack of internal oversight and competence. The AEC's dismissal of these critiques as \"irrelevant\" or stating that its \"own organization\u2019s endorsement of its own process is an entirely circular justification\" (Document 3) demonstrates a troubling lack of responsiveness and accountability to legitimate concerns.\n*   **Compromising Electoral Integrity:** The objections to the registration of the \"David Pocock\" party (Document 8) highlight a concern that the AEC adopted an \"extraordinarily narrow approach to statutory interpretation\" (\"ticking boxes\") rather than considering the broader \"scheme of the legislation or its purpose.\" This enabled the registration of a party named after an individual publicly admitting foreign citizenship, raising concerns about the AEC's role in upholding constitutional eligibility for elected officials. Such administrative failures can indirectly compromise national integrity by allowing ineligible individuals to stand, wasting electoral resources, and undermining public trust in the democratic process.\n\nIn summary, these documents paint a picture of an electoral commission that, in the view of the complainants, may be operating inefficiently, infringing on individual liberties through arbitrary rules and perceived bias, and exceeding its limited governmental mandate through questionable interpretations and administrative incompetence. These issues directly contradict key conservative tenets and suggest a need for greater transparency, accountability, and adherence to foundational principles in government administration.", "model": "gemini-2.5-flash", "generated_at": "2025-06-22T14:01:17.438874", "source_hash": "69f919acff14109a25c38d41674ae607a42fc20be91a054d7510844d5633adca", "raw_response_path": "data/llm_responses/LEX3070__overall__right_leaning__20250622T140117.json", "output_tokens": 973, "prompt_tokens": 38393, "total_tokens": 43509, "summary_length": 5316}, "short_index": {"text": "These FOI documents highlight significant concerns regarding the Australian Electoral Commission's (AEC) administration of electoral regulations, suggesting a troubling departure from core conservative principles.

This analysis, reportedly ignored by the AEC, suggests an agency unwilling to engage with evidence-based critiques of its own operations.\n\nKey findings highlighting waste, power abuse, and questionable decisions include:\n\n*   **Arbitrary and Inconsistent Application of Rules:** The Democratic Labour Party (DLP) alleges they were \"singled out for quick deregistration\" while other, \"left-leaning secular parties\" receiving similar notices remained registered. DLP also claims that while they were denied permission to submit additional member lists, other parties were \"permitted to lodge new lists along with their statement\" without explicit permission, indicating a lack of uniform and fair process.\n*   **Flawed Statistical Sampling:** Parties contend the AEC's reliance on \"tiny samples\" (e.g., 42 members from a list of 1650) to determine eligibility is \"questionable from the standpoints of both procedural fairness and legal validity.\" The AEC's justification for this method is dismissed as \"entirely circular justification\" lacking credibility. This ineffective process wastes party resources in compliance efforts and AEC resources in conducting flawed tests and managing subsequent appeals.\n*   **Artificial Barriers to Compliance:** The AEC's policy of capping submitted membership lists at 1650 names, even when parties claim to have thousands more (e.g., Flux with 4680, Health Australia Party with ~4000), is viewed as an arbitrary limitation that actively prevents parties from demonstrating their true membership numbers. Furthermore, the Health Australia Party alleges they were \"denied access to the ELIAS database for every State and Territory\" to clean their membership lists, severely restricting their ability to comply.\n*   **Dismissal of Reasoned Critique and Lack of Accountability:** The AEC's response to detailed statistical challenges is characterized as dismissive, relying on self-endorsement rather than engaging with the facts. One AEC delegate's \"statement of reasons\" is criticized for being \"dishonest\" and largely \"irrelevant\" to the core arguments of flawed methodology. This indicates a profound lack of transparency and an unwillingness to be held accountable for potentially erroneous decisions.\n*   **\"Ticking Boxes\" Mentality over Legislative Intent:** In the case of the David Pocock party registration, an objector claims the AEC adopted an \"extraordinarily narrow approach to statutory interpretation\" and a \"ticking boxes\" approach. This led to the purported failure to consider a candidate's public admission of foreign citizenship (a fundamental eligibility issue) or the potential for voter confusion and \"unfair advantage\" if a candidate's name appears as both a party and an individual on the ballot. This suggests bureaucratic rigidity overriding the broader purpose of electoral law and potentially misleading the public.\n*   **Evidence of Clerical Errors and Incompetence:** The Australian Progressives detail a \"clerical error\" where their matched membership rate inexplicably dropped from 96% to 12% between two submissions, suggesting a lack of rigor or competence in AEC's internal processes. Historical analysis of AEC tables also points to instances where \"typos\" in testing parameters were \"enforced,\" leading to incorrect deregistration outcomes.\n\nIn summary, the documents paint a picture of an AEC whose administrative processes, particularly in regulating political parties, are perceived as arbitrary, lacking transparency, and fundamentally flawed. The rigid adherence to dubious methodologies, coupled with a dismissive attitude towards detailed critiques and apparent internal inefficiencies, raises serious questions about the AEC's integrity, its equitable treatment of all political actors, and its role in maintaining a fair and competitive democratic landscape.", "model": "gemini-2.5-flash", "generated_at": "2025-06-22T14:01:49.497273", "source_hash": "69f919acff14109a25c38d41674ae607a42fc20be91a054d7510844d5633adca", "raw_response_path": "data/llm_responses/LEX3070__overall__government_skeptic__20250622T140149.json", "output_tokens": 859, "prompt_tokens": 38389, "total_tokens": 42026, "summary_length": 4537}, "short_index": {"text": "From a skeptic's viewpoint, these FOI documents expose an Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) riddled with administrative overreach and a concerning lack of transparency, particularly in party registration processes.

This methodology is critical for ensuring that registered parties possess genuine public support, thereby streamlining the electoral landscape and reducing complexity for voters. Any challenges to this methodology are not indicative of flaws, but rather demonstrate the transparency and accountability inherent in the AEC's processes, where parties are afforded comprehensive avenues for review and appeal under the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918.\n\nFurthermore, the documents illustrate the government's commitment to procedural fairness and due process.

Far from upholding electoral integrity, the AEC's actions, as meticulously detailed by the aggrieved parties, suggest an agency that is either spectacularly inept, deliberately obstructive, or a willing participant in the suppression of political competition.\n\n**A. Membership Testing: A \"Rigged Farce\" Built on Incompetence and Obstruction:**\n\nThe most damning revelations center on the AEC\u2019s membership testing methodology, repeatedly lambasted as \"faulty,\" \"unreliable,\" \"unfair,\" \"unsuitable,\" and explicitly \"rigged and a farce.\"\n\n1.  **Statistical Malpractice and Deliberate Failure:** Max Kaye\u2019s extensive statistical analysis (Doc 3 & 5, particularly from VOTEFLUX.ORG) mathematically proves the AEC's test is designed to fail eligible parties. For a hypothetical party (like Flux, with thousands of legitimate members), the test has a near 99.998% false-negative rate, meaning it is \"predetermined in its outcome\" and provides \"no meaningful information\" on actual membership. This isn't mere error; it's a profound systemic flaw that, when combined with the AEC's continued reliance on it despite clear evidence, demonstrates either an unparalleled level of statistical illiteracy or a cynical, deliberate intent to deregister parties.\n2.  **Arbitrary Limits and Biased Sampling:** The AEC's policy of limiting submitted member lists to 1,650, even when parties (like Flux with 4,680 members and HAP with ~4,000) possess far more, is identified as a primary cause of these false negatives. This artificial constraint, described as \"AEC policy alone\" with \"no mathematical reason,\" actively prevents accurate assessment. Adding insult to injury, the AEC\u2019s decision to select the *top 1,650 names alphabetically* from Flux's list (Doc 3) for testing demonstrates a breathtaking level of procedural ignorance or a malicious intent to introduce bias, effectively guaranteeing a skewed result.\n3.  **Active Obstruction and Unequal Treatment:** The Democratic Labour Party (DLP, Doc 2) and Health Australia Party (HAP, Doc 6) explicitly accuse the AEC of denying natural justice and creating an uneven playing field. DLP alleges being denied the opportunity to submit additional member lists while other, implicitly favored, parties were permitted to do so. HAP was actively denied access to the full national electoral roll database (ELIAS), severely hindering its ability to clean its membership list \u2013 yet the AEC then penalizes them for issues like deceased members. This suggests a pattern of deliberately setting up smaller parties to fail by withholding necessary tools and applying inconsistent standards.\n4.  **Administrative Shambles and Gross Negligence:** The Australian Progressives (Doc 9) highlight a catastrophic \"clerical error\" where their membership match rate plummeted from 96% to 12% between submissions. This, coupled with the \"lack of a similar breakdown\" in the AEC's response, points to an organization cutting corners, operating with alarming sloppiness, and fundamentally mismanaging critical data, directly jeopardizing a party's democratic participation. The historical revelation that the AEC enforced a \"typo\" in its own testing table for \"at least 4 years\" (Doc 3, appendix) without detection or correction is a damning indictment of its internal quality control and oversight.\n\n**B. Beyond Membership: Misleading the Public and Undermining Democratic Processes:**\n\nThe AEC's failures extend beyond membership tests, revealing a broader pattern of negligence and potential complicity in undermining electoral fairness.\n\n1.  **Enabling Ineligible Candidates and Ignoring Constitutional Risks:** The objection to the \"David Pocock party\" (Doc 8) highlights the AEC's dangerously superficial \"ticking boxes\" approach to party registration. Despite public admissions of foreign citizenship from the candidate, the AEC allegedly ignored these critical eligibility concerns. This inaction is condemned as \"misleading the Australian public\" and directly contributing to a risk of \"ineligible\" persons being elected, echoing past constitutional crises caused by the AEC's \"procedural failure.\" This demonstrates a shocking disregard for foundational constitutional requirements and the integrity of elected office.\n2.  **Lax Standards and Unfair Advantage:** The same objection (Doc 8) also lambasts the AEC for allowing \"David Pocock\" as a party name, arguing it is inconsistent with the legal concept of a \"party.\" This decision is portrayed as \"perverse\" and granting an \"unfair advantage\" by causing confusion on ballot papers, reinforcing the perception that the AEC is not maintaining a level playing field or even basic common sense in its registration decisions.\n3.  **Ignoring Public and Party Concerns:** The email regarding the Australian Federation Party logo (Doc 1) raises concerns about a tick mark that could \"invalidate the vote\" or mislead voters, yet the objection notes \"only five have objected,\" suggesting AEC's indifference to minor but valid public concerns. More broadly, the repeated accusations from Flux that the AEC \"ignored our criticisms\" and \"does not care about reason, or logic, or statistical arguments\" (Doc 3), instead offering \"insanity\" and \"circular\" justifications, paints a picture of an unresponsive and unaccountable bureaucracy.\n\nIn conclusion, the documents collectively portray an AEC that is fundamentally compromised. Its procedures are demonstrably flawed, its interpretations of law are \"extraordinarily narrow,\" and its responses to legitimate concerns are arrogant and dismissive. The repeated accusations of unfairness, incompetence, and potentially deliberate actions to disadvantage non-parliamentary parties \u2013 all while claiming \"integrity, professionalism and quality\" \u2013 paint a damning picture of an institution actively undermining the very democratic processes it is mandated to protect.", "model": "gemini-2.5-flash", "generated_at": "2025-06-22T14:02:50.431003", "source_hash": "69f919acff14109a25c38d41674ae607a42fc20be91a054d7510844d5633adca", "raw_response_path": "data/llm_responses/LEX3070__overall__highly_critical__20250622T140250.json", "output_tokens": 1220, "prompt_tokens": 38390, "total_tokens": 42790, "summary_length": 6090}, "short_index": {"text": "The Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) stands exposed as a profoundly compromised institution, its documented actions revealing a scandalous pattern of systemic incompetence, profound bias, and a casual contempt for democratic principles.
