      <p><strong>Summary of FOI Documents: AEC Spear Phishing Campaign</strong></p>
<p>This summary is based on documents released in response to an FOI request concerning a cyber incident at the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC).</p>
<h3>Main Purpose of the FOI Request</h3>
<p>The FOI request sought information regarding a specific cyber incident (designated INC11744) involving a "spear phishing" campaign that targeted the Australian Electoral Commission's (AEC) Indigenous Electoral Participation Program (IEPP) mailboxes in November 2022. The request aimed to understand the nature of the attack, the AEC's response, and any internal discussions or assessments related to its implications, particularly in the context of the proposed referendum.</p>
<h3>Documents from the FOI Request</h3>
<p>The released documents primarily consist of:<br />
*   Internal AEC emails detailing the incident, its handling, and internal communications.<br />
*   Cyber security briefs and summaries related to INC11744.<br />
*   Agenda papers and talking points prepared for internal AEC committees (such as the Electoral Integrity Committee - EIC, and the Electoral Integrity Assurance Taskforce - EIAT Board) and for discussions with other government agencies (like the National Indigenous Australians Agency - NIAA).<br />
*   Two documents related to communication with the Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC) were refused access. Most other documents were released in part due to exemptions (s22, s47E, s47F).</p>
<h3>Main Content from the FOI Request Documents</h3>
<p>The documents reveal the following key details regarding the cyber incident:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Incident Identification:</strong> On 14 November 2022, a "spear phishing" email campaign (Cyber Incident 11744) was launched targeting eight specific Indigenous AEC email accounts (IEPP mailboxes: <code>indigenous@aec.gov.au</code>, <code>indigenous-sa@aec.gov.au</code>, <code>indigenous-wa@aec.gov.au</code>, <code>indigenous-vic@aec.gov.au</code>, <code>indigenous-tas@aec.gov.au</code>, <code>indigenous-qld@aec.gov.au</code>, <code>indigenous-nt@aec.gov.au</code>, <code>indigenous-nsw@aec.gov.au</code>).</li>
<li><strong>Attack Method:</strong> The emails were sent from a falsified address (<code>support@aec.gov.au</code>) with the subject line <code>[recipient email address] have 12 Pending incoming emails</code>. The campaign's objective was identified as an "account harvesting attempt," aiming to steal personal information.</li>
<li><strong>Impact and Response:</strong> AEC systems were <strong>not compromised</strong> by the attack, and the incident was successfully contained internally. Staff promptly reported suspicious emails, which were then removed from the affected mailboxes. The Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC) was engaged regarding the incident.</li>
<li><strong>Analysis and Significance:</strong> The campaign was assessed as "very targeted" and "somewhat sophisticated." Internal AEC communications indicate that it was considered "possible it relates to the proposed referendum given the targeting of AEC’s Indigenous Electoral Participation Program mailboxes."</li>
<li><strong>Internal and Inter-Agency Discussions:</strong> The incident was a significant topic for internal discussions within the AEC, including briefings to the Electoral Integrity Committee (EIC) and the Electoral Integrity Assurance Taskforce (EIAT) Board. Talking points were developed for senior AEC leadership and for meetings with other government bodies, such as the National Indigenous Australians Agency (NIAA), to explain the attack's purpose, trends, overall risks, and the role of the EIAT in maintaining electoral integrity.</li>
<li><strong>Cyber Threat Awareness:</strong> The incident reinforced the AEC's message that the "cyber threat environment for the proposed referendum is unlikely to be lower than for a federal election," emphasizing the need for continued vigilance.</li>

    <div class="ai-summary-markdown-content">
      <p>The documents reveal insights into a targeted "spear phishing" cyber attack against the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) in November 2022, specifically focusing on mailboxes associated with the Indigenous Electoral Participation Program (IEPP). From a politically left-leaning analytical perspective, this incident highlights critical issues related to social justice, civil liberties, and the government's role in upholding democratic integrity, particularly concerning First Nations communities.</p>
<p><strong>Social Justice Implications:</strong><br />
The most prominent social justice concern is the precise and deliberate targeting of the AEC's Indigenous Electoral Participation Program (IEPP) email accounts across all states and territories. These mailboxes (e.g., indigenous@aec.gov.au, indigenous-sa@aec.gov.au, etc.) are crucial channels for engaging with and supporting Indigenous Australians in their democratic participation. The documents explicitly state that the phishing campaign was "very targeted" and "somewhat sophisticated," and "it is possible it relates to the proposed referendum given the targeting of AEC’s Indigenous Electoral Participation Program mailboxes." This strongly suggests an attempt to disrupt, undermine, or collect sensitive information related to Indigenous Australians' engagement with the upcoming Voice to Parliament referendum, a pivotal social justice initiative. Such targeting disproportionately affects an already marginalized group, potentially eroding trust and hindering their ability to exercise their democratic rights and self-determination.</p>
<p><strong>Civil Liberties and Democratic Participation:</strong><br />
The phishing attempt, aimed at "account harvesting," poses a direct threat to the civil liberties of Indigenous Australians by attempting to compromise the security and integrity of their electoral engagement. While the AEC confirmed its systems were "not compromised in any way," the intent was clearly to gain unauthorized access to information or accounts related to Indigenous electoral participation. This directly impacts the civil liberty to participate in a free and fair democratic process, free from malicious interference. The incident underscores the broader cyber threat environment for the "proposed referendum," emphasizing the need to protect all citizens' access to accurate information and secure electoral channels, particularly for vulnerable communities.</p>
<p><strong>Government Actions: Alignment and Deviation from Progressive Values:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Alignment with Progressive Values:</strong><br />
*   <strong>Prompt and Targeted Response:</strong> The AEC's immediate identification and containment of the phishing attempt, including the removal of malicious emails, demonstrates a commendable commitment to protecting electoral integrity.<br />
*   <strong>Recognition of Specific Vulnerability:</strong> The internal communications explicitly acknowledge the highly targeted nature of the attack on IEPP mailboxes and its potential link to the Voice referendum. This recognition aligns with progressive values by demonstrating awareness of and responsiveness to the unique vulnerabilities faced by First Nations communities in the digital and political landscape.<br />
*   <strong>Inter-agency Collaboration:</strong> The swift communication and collaboration with the Electoral Integrity Assurance Taskforce (EIAT) and the National Indigenous Australians Agency (NIAA) to share information and assess risks highlight a collective government effort to defend the democratic process, particularly where social justice issues are at stake. The NIAA’s proactive request for clarity on the attack's purpose and risks further underscores this commitment.<br />
*   <strong>Emphasis on Referendum Security:</strong> The consistent messaging about the high cyber threat environment for the proposed referendum, comparable to a federal election, indicates a commitment to robust security measures for a significant event concerning Indigenous recognition.</p>
<p><strong>Potential Deviations/Areas for Further Scrutiny:</strong><br />
*   <strong>Inherent Vulnerability:</strong> While the AEC's response was effective, the fact that IEPP mailboxes were perceived as a strategic target for such a "sophisticated" attack raises questions about potential pre-existing vulnerabilities or the level of proactive cyber protection in place for these critically important and sensitive communication channels. A progressive perspective might ask if enough preventative measures were in place to shield programs serving vulnerable populations.<br />
*   <strong>Transparency Limitations:</strong> The extensive redactions (s47E, s47F, s22) in the released documents, while common in FOI responses for national security and internal deliberative matters, limit full transparency. From a progressive standpoint, comprehensive public understanding of such incidents, especially those targeting specific communities and significant social reforms, is crucial for public trust and accountability. The extent of these redactions prevents a complete external audit of the threat landscape and the robustness of the response, potentially hindering public discourse on electoral security and civil liberties.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the documents reveal a concerning but contained cyber attack specifically targeting Indigenous electoral engagement channels ahead of a landmark referendum. The government's actions, through the AEC and its partners, largely align with progressive values of protecting democratic integrity and supporting Indigenous participation. However, the incident also underscores the ongoing need for vigilance, robust preventative measures, and greater transparency to safeguard the civil liberties and social justice aspirations of First Nations people in Australia's democratic processes.</p>

    <div class="ai-summary-markdown-content">
      <p>The provided FOI documents primarily detail a spear phishing cyber incident targeting the Australian Electoral Commission's (AEC) Indigenous Electoral Participation Program (IEPP) mailboxes in late 2022. From a politically right-leaning analytical perspective, the documents reveal both positive alignments with and potential deviations from core conservative principles.</p>
<p><strong>National Security &amp; Economic Efficiency:</strong><br />
The documents demonstrate a commendable alignment with the principles of <strong>national security</strong> and <strong>economic efficiency</strong>. The AEC swiftly identified, contained, and internally managed a "targeted and somewhat sophisticated" cyberattack, which was an attempt at "account harvesting" or stealing personal information. This prompt action, initiated by staff reporting suspicious emails, prevented a system compromise, indicating effective cyber defenses and a proactive approach to protecting electoral infrastructure. Preventing a breach directly safeguards the integrity of the democratic process, a cornerstone of national security, and avoids the significant financial costs associated with recovering from a major cyber incident. The documents explicitly state, "AEC systems were not compromised in any way," signifying a fiscally responsible outcome by preventing large-scale data breaches or operational disruptions that would incur substantial taxpayer expense. The engagement with the Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC) and internal discussions reinforce a serious approach to potential threats to Australia's electoral integrity.</p>
<p><strong>Individual Liberty:</strong><br />
The successful defense against this phishing attempt indirectly aligns with the principle of <strong>individual liberty</strong>. By protecting the integrity and security of the AEC's systems, particularly those related to voter engagement and participation (like the IEPP mailboxes), the government is upholding the freedom and security of citizens' participation in the electoral process. Preventing unauthorized access to government systems that may hold or process individual data is crucial for maintaining trust and protecting personal information, a vital component of individual liberty in the digital age.</p>
<p><strong>Limited Government &amp; Fiscal Responsibility (Potential Scrutiny):</strong><br />
While the immediate response to the cyber incident was efficient, a closer examination through a <strong>limited government</strong> and <strong>fiscal responsibility</strong> lens might raise questions about the broader bureaucratic framework. The extensive internal email chains, multiple levels of review, and numerous meetings (e.g., Electoral Integrity Committee, Electoral Integrity Assurance Taskforce, inter-departmental discussions with the National Indigenous Australians Agency) for a "contained" and "uncompromised" incident could be seen as an example of administrative overhead. While vigilance is necessary, the sheer volume of internal consultation for a non-breach event might suggest potential inefficiencies in bureaucratic processes. The documents indicate ongoing discussions about the "cyber threat environment for the proposed referendum," which, while a legitimate concern for electoral integrity, could also be viewed as an expansion of government focus into broader "mis/disinformation" monitoring, potentially bordering on areas that, if unchecked, might infringe upon free speech or individual information flows, deviating from a strictly limited government role. However, within the scope of cybersecurity, this appears to be a legitimate defensive measure. The consistent messaging that the "cyber threat environment... is unlikely to be lower than for a federal election" underscores the ongoing need for prudent, but not necessarily expansive, government expenditure in this critical area.</p>

    <div class="ai-summary-markdown-content">
      <p>The released FOI documents, heavily redacted and selectively disclosed, paint a picture of a bureaucratic apparatus more concerned with narrative control and inter-departmental posturing than with transparently addressing security vulnerabilities. Despite government assurances that "AEC systems were not compromised in any way," the extensive redactions and outright refusals to release documents, citing a broad range of exemptions (s47E, s47F, s22, S7(2A)(a)(vii)), raise serious questions about the full extent of the "spear phishing" attack targeting sensitive "Indigenous Electoral Participation Program" mailboxes in November 2022.</p>
<p>Key findings include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Controlled Narrative and Obfuscation:</strong> Internal communications reveal a deliberate effort to "strengthen the emphasis there was no compromise" and to "remove unnecessary detail about the AEC’s internal response" when informing other agencies like the Electoral Integrity Assurance Taskforce (EIAT). This suggests an intentional strategy to downplay the incident and limit public or inter-agency scrutiny.</li>
<li><strong>Bureaucratic Bloat and Inefficiency:</strong> The incident, a basic phishing attempt, generated numerous internal emails, required "talking points" for multiple internal and external meetings (EIAT Board, IDC), and involved multiple layers of approval for information sharing. The National Indigenous Australians Agency (NIAA) even had to ask for "clarity re the purpose of the attack, trends, and what the overall risks are" and to "understand what the EIAT is and whether a referendum specific one is needed," indicating a lack of clear understanding or operational efficiency within the government's own "integrity" framework.</li>
<li><strong>Hidden Vulnerabilities:</strong> A revealing comment highlights that IPFS content (which may have been used in the phishing attack) is "difficult to take down," requiring "more effort than usual for cyberdefenders" to reach all gateways for removal. This points to unaddressed, fundamental cyber vulnerabilities that are not being transparently communicated or effectively managed, instead being obscured by claims of "systems not compromised."</li>
<li><strong>Excessive Secrecy:</strong> The sheer volume of redacted information, particularly under sections like s47F (personal information), s47E (deliberative processes), and s22 (irrelevant information), prevents a comprehensive understanding of the incident, the internal discussions, and the full extent of the government's response. The outright refusal of access to two documents citing s7(2A)(a)(vii) ("information concerning the operations of an enforcement or protection agency") suggests a desire to shield specific operational details or potential failures from public view, rather than genuinely protecting national security.</li>
<li><strong>Pre-emptive Justification for Future Incidents:</strong> Repeated warnings that the "cyber threat environment for the proposed referendum is unlikely to be lower than for a federal election" could be interpreted as an attempt to pre-emptively excuse future security lapses or justify increased cybersecurity budgets without a demonstrable track record of effective transparency or incident management.</li>
</ul>
<p>In essence, these documents, despite their heavily censored nature, reveal a government apparatus that prioritizes reputation and control over genuine transparency, fostering an environment where critical information is withheld and bureaucratic processes appear to overshadow effective and accountable governance.</p>

      <p>The recently released FOI documents detail a successful instance of the government's robust cybersecurity measures and effective incident response in action. In November 2022, a sophisticated "spear phishing" email campaign, attempting to harvest account credentials, targeted the Australian Electoral Commission's (AEC) Indigenous Electoral Participation Program (IEPP) mailboxes.</p>
<p>This incident, while a challenge, clearly demonstrates the government's proactive and decisive approach to safeguarding critical digital infrastructure. Key takeaways include:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Rapid Detection and Containment:</strong> The threat was swiftly identified by vigilant AEC staff and immediately reported. Government cybersecurity teams initiated an investigation within hours, promptly confirming the malicious nature of the emails. Crucially, all targeted emails were removed from inboxes within a very short timeframe, preventing any potential compromise. The documents repeatedly confirm that <strong>AEC systems were not compromised in any way</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Robust Security Protocols:</strong> The seamless and effective handling of this incident is a testament to the government's commitment to and implementation of high-standard cybersecurity frameworks, such as the "Essential Eight" strategies mentioned in internal briefings. These necessary regulations and robust procedures ensured that a targeted attack was neutralized before any harm could occur.</li>
<li><strong>Collaborative Governance and Public Good:</strong> The incident was promptly escalated and discussed across various government entities, including the Electoral Integrity Committee (EIC) and the Electoral Integrity Assurance Taskforce (EIAT). Briefings were also provided to the National Indigenous Australians Agency (NIAA), demonstrating a coordinated, whole-of-government approach to address and learn from such challenges. This information sharing reinforces the government's commitment to transparency with relevant stakeholders and its proactive efforts to serve the public by enhancing collective security.</li>
<li><strong>Forward-Looking Preparedness:</strong> The incident served as a valuable case study, informing ongoing cybersecurity awareness activities and preparedness for future national events, particularly the proposed referendum. It reinforced the understanding that the cyber threat environment remains dynamic, and continuous vigilance is essential for protecting democratic processes.</li>
</ol>
<p>The partial release of these documents, with standard exemptions for internal deliberative processes and personal information, reflects a responsible balance between transparency and protecting sensitive operational details vital for maintaining national security and effective public service. This ensures that while the public is informed, the specific tactics and vulnerabilities that could be exploited by malicious actors remain secure. Overall, these documents highlight the government's unwavering dedication to effective governance, necessary regulations, and positive outcomes in the face of evolving cyber threats.</p>

    <div class="ai-summary-markdown-content">
      <p>The provided FOI documents expose a disturbing pattern of vulnerability, bureaucratic inertia, and a concerning lack of transparency within the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) following a targeted cyberattack on highly sensitive Indigenous mailboxes. Far from demonstrating competence, the records paint a picture of reactive, rather than proactive, security measures and a deliberate attempt to control the narrative around a serious breach attempt.</p>
<p><strong>Initial Vulnerability and Delayed Detection:</strong><br />
On 14 November 2022, malicious actors launched a highly targeted spear phishing campaign directly at the AEC's eight Indigenous Electoral Participation Program (IEPP) mailboxes. These accounts, critical for engagement with Indigenous communities, were explicitly chosen targets. Shockingly, the AEC's vaunted cyber defences failed to prevent or even immediately detect this attack. Instead, the incident was first reported by a vigilant Victorian State Office staff member at 6:19 PM on 15 November, nearly <strong>20 hours</strong> after the emails were sent. This reliance on human vigilance rather than automated, robust security systems is a damning indictment of the AEC's cybersecurity posture, especially on such critical and sensitive accounts.</p>
<p><strong>Sluggish and Incompetent Response:</strong><br />
Even once alerted, the AEC's response was glacially slow. Initial investigations didn't commence until 8:15 AM on 16 November, over <strong>14 hours</strong> after the staff member's report. The removal of the malicious emails from the compromised mailboxes wasn't completed until 9:50 AM on 16 November, almost <strong>35 hours</strong> after the initial attack. This protracted response time for a "targeted and sophisticated" account harvesting attempt on high-profile mailboxes suggests significant procedural and technical incompetence, leaving sensitive channels vulnerable for an unacceptably long period. An internal email even reflects this inadequacy, stating, "I'll take this as a lesson for all of us who manage security systems," revealing a reactive 'lessons learned' approach rather than a foundation of pre-emptive strength.</p>
<p><strong>Internal Disarray and Information Control:</strong><br />
The documents reveal a chaotic internal communication environment. Initial emails show basic 'FYI' sharing, with no clear, immediate chain of command or a sense of urgency befitting a targeted attack. Later communications indicate that information sharing with external, but relevant, bodies like the Electoral Integrity Assurance Taskforce (EIAT) and the National Indigenous Australians Agency (NIAA) was delayed and heavily sanitized. The AEC explicitly "removed unnecessary detail about the AEC’s internal response" from information shared with EIAT, suggesting a deliberate effort to conceal operational failures. The NIAA had to actively pursue answers about the attack and the EIAT's role, indicating a lack of proactive transparency from the AEC. Furthermore, internal email chains reveal confusion and delays in simply preparing "talking points" for senior officials months after the incident, highlighting a profound bureaucratic inertia.</p>
<p><strong>Obfuscation and Secrecy:</strong><br />
The sheer volume of redactions (s47E, s47F, s22) and outright refusal of access (s7(2A)(a)(vii)) to multiple documents related to this incident is a hallmark of an institution with something to hide. Details on "blocked emails" and deeper insights into the Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC) interaction have been withheld, raising suspicions that the full extent of the vulnerability or the criticisms from higher authorities are being deliberately suppressed. The AEC’s repeated assertion that "systems were not compromised in any way" clashes with the fact that malicious emails were actively residing in their inboxes for an extended period, requiring manual removal due to the difficulty of taking down "IPFS content." This suggests a fundamental weakness in email security and a disingenuous public narrative.</p>
<p><strong>Damning Implications for the Referendum:</strong><br />
The most damning implication is the direct targeting of Indigenous mailboxes ahead of the Voice to Parliament referendum. The AEC itself acknowledges this possibility, stating, "It is possible it relates to the proposed referendum given the targeting of AEC’s Indigenous Electoral Participation Program mailboxes." Yet, the documents reveal a slow, manual, and reactive defence against an attack that could have severely impacted the integrity and perception of the referendum process among Indigenous communities. The entire incident exposes the AEC as an organization ill-equipped to handle sophisticated cyber threats, preferring to downplay failures and obscure details rather than demonstrating robust and transparent resilience. The public is left to wonder what other vulnerabilities remain unaddressed and what critical information is being withheld.</p>

Hi Brian 

Below is the current summary of the email attack targeting state indigenous group mailboxes inboxes (account 
harvesting attempt). 

Some additional points to note: 

  This email campaign is very targeted 

  Staff in the network managing the mailboxes have been contacted 
  The emails are being removed from the mailboxes to avoid any future issues (completed 09:50) 
 

 

I’ve already given Julie a quick heads up given the thematic of the campaign and expect this will want a broader 
Integrity lens given the very specific targeting. 

 along with any other relevant updates as more information 

becomes available. 

Regards

FOR ACTION: IDC Agenda_8/12  [SEC=OFFICIAL:Sensitive]
KG TPs - NIAA - Phishing attempt against the AEC.docx

As requested by Dr Gleeson / Mr Lynch late last year (see below thread), please see attached talking points on the 
spear phishing attempt against the AEC in November 2022, reported to the EIAT and queried by the NIAA.  

For quick reference, the NIAA has asked for: 

- 

Clarity re the purpose of the attack, trends, and what the overall risks are. Also would be good to understand 
what the EIAT is and whether a referendum specific one is needed. 

We have also provided context regarding the EIAT and its potential role for the proposed referendum, including that 
the Board intends to brief the NIAA / Referendum IDC. 

For your review and clearance to Michael please. 

Kind regards

Hi Kath!  

OFFICIAL: Sensitive 

Apologies about the mix up and I didn’t mean to put AEC on the spot. 

We received the below notification from the Electoral Integrity Assurance Taskforce (EIAT) about a phishing attempt 
on the AEC. 

I think it would be good to get clarity re the purpose of the attack, trends, and what the overall risks are. Also would 
be good to understand what the EIAT is and whether a referendum specific one is needed. 

At the last IDC it was decided to have a 1 hour session in January to cover it all off. Is that okay?

Subject: For awareness: AEC spear phishing campaign [SEC=OFFICIAL:Sensitive] 

CAUTION: This email originated from outside of the organisation. Do not follow guidance, click links, or open 
attachments unless you recognise the sender and know the content is safe. 

Good afternoon EIAT members 

For your information and awareness, we would like to bring to your attention a recent ‘spear phishing’ email 
campaign at the AEC.  The detail of these emails is below.   

AEC systems were not compromised in any way. We believe this is worthwhile sharing with the EIAT on the basis 
that despite being contained by the AEC, the campaign appears targeted and somewhat sophisticated.  It is possible 
it relates to the proposed referendum given the targeting of AEC’s Indigenous Electoral Participation Program 
mailboxes.  

It is a reminder that the cyber threat environment for the proposed referendum is unlikely to be lower than for a 
federal election. 

Email details 
On 14 November 2022, at 22:52, a series of emails were sent to the AEC’s eight IEPP mailboxes, from the falsified 
email address support[@]aec.gov.au, with the subject ‘[email address] have 12 Pending incoming emails’. The list of 
recipients is as follows: 

• 
• 
• 
•

Wonderful, thanks 

I will share the general response with NIAA but given the mis/dis meeting has been set up now for Friday it will make 
most sense for Matt to provide this context in that session.  

And on the topic of Friday’s meeting, I have forwarded another invitation that has come from NIAA. @Matthew – pls 
invite anyone from your team you want there (EES, perhaps?).  

- 
- 

I intend to open given I kind of instigated this joining up (unless 
I will perhaps throw to Matt for some info on: 

 does) 

o  Briefly what EIAT is and what was done in mis/dis space for 22FE 
o  What we intend to do for 23Ref 
o  What we won’t do (I’m happy to speak to this if needed. But it is basically anything not relating to 

process of the referendum, e.g. operation of The Voice etc.) 

- 

I understand there will be reps from AGD, DoF, Infra &amp; Comms 

 and Home Affairs 

 NIAA.

Subject: FW: FOR ACTION: IDC Agenda_8/12 [SEC=OFFICIAL:Sensitive] 

Hi Kath 

Please see the attached talking points, now cleared by AC EICB Matt Haigh, regarding the below email thread and 
request for information from the NIAA in December. 

For quick reference, the NIAA has asked for: 

- 

Clarity re the purpose of the [spear phishing] attack, trends, and what the overall risks are. Also would be 
good to understand what the EIAT is and whether a referendum specific one is needed. 

This topic may be raised during the VOICE Mis/Disinformation meeting with the NIAA (and others) on Friday 13 
January 2022. If that is the case, Matt is attending and is comfortable talking to the subject given the EICB equites as 
well as his role as Chair of the Electoral Integrity Assurance Taskforce if you would like. 

In response to NIAA’s queries at a high-level: 

- 

- 

Information about the EIAT is within the talking points, including the EIAT Board’s intention to brief the NIAA 
/ Referendum IDC about the EIAT and its potential role during the proposed referendum – likely to occur soon 
or at least within qtr. 1 2023 (to be scheduled by PM&amp;C). 

Please let me know if you have any questions. 

Kind regards 
Anna 

 | Assistant Director

Good afternoon EIAT members 

For your information and awareness, we would like to bring to your attention a recent ‘spear phishing’ email 
campaign at the AEC.  The detail of these emails is below.   

AEC systems were not compromised in any way. We believe this is worthwhile sharing with the EIAT on the basis 
that despite being contained by the AEC, the campaign appears targeted and somewhat sophisticated.  It is possible 
it relates to the proposed referendum given the targeting of AEC’s Indigenous Electoral Participation Program 
mailboxes.  

It is a reminder that the cyber threat environment for the proposed referendum is unlikely to be lower than for a 
federal election. 

Email details 
On 14 November 2022, at 22:52, a series of emails were sent to the AEC’s eight IEPP mailboxes, from the falsified 
email address support[@]aec.gov.au, with the subject ‘[email address] have 12 Pending incoming emails’. The list of 
recipients is as follows: 

• 
• 
•

Spear Phishing Attempt Against the AEC

Overview 

•  There was a ‘spear phishing’ email campaign against the AEC in November 2023. A phishing campaign 
is typically an email scam designed to steal personal information from victims and spear phishing is 
when the campaign is targeted or more specific to the recipient/s. 

•  AEC systems were not compromised in any way and the incident was managed internally. 

• 

. 

•  We shared this information with the EIAT on the basis that despite being contained, the campaign 

appeared targeted and somewhat sophisticated. 

• 

It is also a reminder to be vigilant against cyber threats in the lead up to, and throughout, the proposed 
referendum.

Hi 

Andrew has now approved a revised version of this being shared with EIAT, as below. We’ve further modified this to 
strengthen the emphasis there was no compromise, and removed unnecessary detail about the AEC’s internal 
response. It is primarily the targeted nature of the content that should be relevant for EIAT’s purposes. 

Dear EIAT members 

For your information and awareness, we would like to bring to your attention a recent ‘spear phishing’ email 
campaign at the AEC.  The detail of these emails is below.   

AEC systems were not compromised in any way. We believe this is worthwhile sharing with the EIAT on the 
basis that despite being contained by the AEC, the campaign appears targeted and somewhat 
sophisticated.  It is possible it relates to the proposed referendum given the targeting of AEC’s Indigenous

It is a reminder that the cyber threat environment for the proposed referendum is unlikely to be lower than 
for a federal election.

Hi Andrew 

I think 

 may have discussed this with you.  

Are you supportive if we notify EIAT members of this incident? The benefit would be to ensure EIAT members 
remain alert to the threats in the referendum environment and particularly reinforce that it is not necessarily a 
lower cyber threat environment compared to a federal election. 

We would propose sharing the incident summary below (happy if you have a more recent version) and introduce it 
along the lines below so as not to alarm anyone or otherwise imply that the AEC was compromised.

Good Morning 

Please refer below for a high level summary that consolidates yesterday’s incident response so we are all on the 
same page as to what happened including the resulting mitigation actions.  While the incident has now been closed 
from a response perspective, 

. 

The nature of the targeted phishing campaign and the resulting incident response may make an excellent case study 
for broader awareness activities in the future. 

Let me know if additional information is required and note we’ve purposely left the more technical details out of

NO.  DESCRIPTION 

Phishing attempt against the AEC 

•  There was a recent ‘spear phishing’ email campaign against the AEC. 

•  Up front: AEC systems were not compromised in any way and was managed 
internally. We also engaged the ACSC and continue to liaise with them. 

• 

•  On 14 November 2022, a series of emails were sent to the AEC’s eight Indigenous 

Electoral Participation Program mailboxes, from the falsified email address 
support[@]aec.gov.au, with the subject ‘[email address] have 12 Pending incoming 
emails’.  

• 

• 

. 

. 

•  We are sharing this with the EIAT on the basis that despite being contained by the 

AEC, the campaign appears targeted and somewhat sophisticated. 

• 

It is also a reminder the cyber threat environment for the proposed referendum is 
unlikely to be lower than for a federal election.

Hi 

Michael and Kath are seeking an update to the below campaign and any further analysis/findings by the AEC 

I imagine you might have already reported on this via other avenues so hopeful you may be able to share 

further information. 

Anything I provide to Michael and Kath will be cleared by Matt.  

Happy to discuss!

Hi 

Andrew has now approved a revised version of this being shared with EIAT, as below. We’ve further modified this to 
strengthen the emphasis there was no compromise, and removed unnecessary detail about the AEC’s internal 
response. It is primarily the targeted nature of the content that should be relevant for EIAT’s purposes. 

Dear EIAT members 

For your information and awareness, we would like to bring to your attention a recent ‘spear phishing’ email 
campaign at the AEC.  The detail of these emails is below.   

AEC systems were not compromised in any way. We believe this is worthwhile sharing with the EIAT on the 
basis that despite being contained by the AEC, the campaign appears targeted and somewhat 
sophisticated.  It is possible it relates to the proposed referendum given the targeting of AEC’s Indigenous 
Electoral Participation Program mailboxes.  

It is a reminder that the cyber threat environment for the proposed referendum is unlikely to be lower than 
for a federal election. 

Email details 
On 14 November 2022, at 22:52, a series of emails were sent to the AEC’s eight IEPP mailboxes, from the falsified 
email address support[@]aec.gov.au, with the subject ‘[email address] have 12 Pending incoming emails’. The list of

Hi Andrew 

I think 

 may have discussed this with you.  

Are you supportive if we notify EIAT members of this incident? The benefit would be to ensure EIAT members 
remain alert to the threats in the referendum environment and particularly reinforce that it is not necessarily a 
lower cyber threat environment compared to a federal election. 

We would propose sharing the incident summary below (happy if you have a more recent version) and introduce it 
along the lines below so as not to alarm anyone or otherwise imply that the AEC was compromised. 

Dear EIAT members 

For your information and awareness, we would like to bring to your attention a recent ‘spear phishing’ 
attempt at the AEC.  The incident summary is below.   

AEC systems were not compromised in anyway.  The attempt appears targeted and somewhat 
sophisticated.  It is possible it relates to the proposed referendum given the targeting of AEC’s Indigenous 
Electoral Participation Program mailboxes.  

It is a reminder that the cyber threat environment for the proposed referendum is unlikely to be lower than 
for a federal election. 

Grateful for your thoughts. 

Regards

Please refer below for a high level summary that consolidates yesterday’s incident response so we are all on the 
same page as to what happened including the resulting mitigation actions.  While the incident has now been closed 
from a response perspective,

. 

The nature of the targeted phishing campaign and the resulting incident response may make an excellent case study 
for broader awareness activities in the future. 

Let me know if additional information is required and note we’ve purposely left the more technical details out of 
this summary.

Hi 

Andrew has now approved a revised version of this being shared with EIAT, as below. We’ve further modified this to 
strengthen the emphasis there was no compromise, and removed unnecessary detail about the AEC’s internal 
response. It is primarily the targeted nature of the content that should be relevant for EIAT’s purposes.

Dear EIAT members 

For your information and awareness, we would like to bring to your attention a recent ‘spear phishing’ 
attempt at the AEC.  The incident summary is below.   

AEC systems were not compromised in anyway.  The attempt appears targeted and somewhat 
sophisticated.  It is possible it relates to the proposed referendum given the targeting of AEC’s Indigenous 
Electoral Participation Program mailboxes.  

It is a reminder that the cyber threat environment for the proposed referendum is unlikely to be lower than 
for a federal election. 

Grateful for your thoughts. 

Regards

Subject: INC11744 summary - AEC spear phishing campaign [SEC=OFFICIAL:Sensitive] 

Good Morning 

Please refer below for a high level summary that consolidates yesterday’s incident response so we are all on the 
same page as to what happened including the resulting mitigation actions.  While the incident has now been closed 
from a response perspective, 

The nature of the targeted phishing campaign and the resulting incident response may make an excellent case study 
for broader awareness activities in the future. 

Let me know if additional information is required and note we’ve purposely left the more technical details out of 
this summary. 

Regards

RE: Phishing email targeting indigenous inboxes  [SEC=OFFICIAL]

Of note, this article, outlines that IPFS content is difficult to take down:  

“To be sure to have this fraudulent content taken down, it takes more effort than usual for cyberdefenders. They 
need to reach all the gateways that lead to the file and ask for removal of the content from their cache.”

Hi Andrew and 

 from the Victorian State Office notified us yesterday evening at 6.19pm about a suspicious email. 

After initial investigations (starting at 8.15am this morning) this appears to be a phishing campaign sent to 8 
Indigenous AEC email accounts: 

 
 
 

indigenous@aec.gov.au 
indigenous-sa@aec.gov.au 
indigenous-wa@aec.gov.au

The request aimed to understand the nature of the attack, the AEC's response, and any internal discussions or assessments related to its implications, particularly in the context of the proposed referendum.\n\n### Documents from the FOI Request\nThe released documents primarily consist of:\n*   Internal AEC emails detailing the incident, its handling, and internal communications.\n*   Cyber security briefs and summaries related to INC11744.\n*   Agenda papers and talking points prepared for internal AEC committees (such as the Electoral Integrity Committee - EIC, and the Electoral Integrity Assurance Taskforce - EIAT Board) and for discussions with other government agencies (like the National Indigenous Australians Agency - NIAA).\n*   Two documents related to communication with the Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC) were refused access. Most other documents were released in part due to exemptions (s22, s47E, s47F).\n\n### Main Content from the FOI Request Documents\nThe documents reveal the following key details regarding the cyber incident:\n\n*   **Incident Identification:** On 14 November 2022, a \"spear phishing\" email campaign (Cyber Incident 11744) was launched targeting eight specific Indigenous AEC email accounts (IEPP mailboxes: `indigenous@aec.gov.au`, `indigenous-sa@aec.gov.au`, `indigenous-wa@aec.gov.au`, `indigenous-vic@aec.gov.au`, `indigenous-tas@aec.gov.au`, `indigenous-qld@aec.gov.au`, `indigenous-nt@aec.gov.au`, `indigenous-nsw@aec.gov.au`).\n*   **Attack Method:** The emails were sent from a falsified address (`support@aec.gov.au`) with the subject line `[recipient email address] have 12 Pending incoming emails`. The campaign's objective was identified as an \"account harvesting attempt,\" aiming to steal personal information.\n*   **Impact and Response:** AEC systems were **not compromised** by the attack, and the incident was successfully contained internally. Staff promptly reported suspicious emails, which were then removed from the affected mailboxes. The Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC) was engaged regarding the incident.\n*   **Analysis and Significance:** The campaign was assessed as \"very targeted\" and \"somewhat sophisticated.\" Internal AEC communications indicate that it was considered \"possible it relates to the proposed referendum given the targeting of AEC\u2019s Indigenous Electoral Participation Program mailboxes.\"\n*   **Internal and Inter-Agency Discussions:** The incident was a significant topic for internal discussions within the AEC, including briefings to the Electoral Integrity Committee (EIC) and the Electoral Integrity Assurance Taskforce (EIAT) Board.

From a politically left-leaning analytical perspective, this incident highlights critical issues related to social justice, civil liberties, and the government's role in upholding democratic integrity, particularly concerning First Nations communities.\n\n**Social Justice Implications:**\nThe most prominent social justice concern is the precise and deliberate targeting of the AEC's Indigenous Electoral Participation Program (IEPP) email accounts across all states and territories. These mailboxes (e.g., indigenous@aec.gov.au, indigenous-sa@aec.gov.au, etc.) are crucial channels for engaging with and supporting Indigenous Australians in their democratic participation. The documents explicitly state that the phishing campaign was \"very targeted\" and \"somewhat sophisticated,\" and \"it is possible it relates to the proposed referendum given the targeting of AEC\u2019s Indigenous Electoral Participation Program mailboxes.\" This strongly suggests an attempt to disrupt, undermine, or collect sensitive information related to Indigenous Australians' engagement with the upcoming Voice to Parliament referendum, a pivotal social justice initiative. Such targeting disproportionately affects an already marginalized group, potentially eroding trust and hindering their ability to exercise their democratic rights and self-determination.\n\n**Civil Liberties and Democratic Participation:**\nThe phishing attempt, aimed at \"account harvesting,\" poses a direct threat to the civil liberties of Indigenous Australians by attempting to compromise the security and integrity of their electoral engagement. While the AEC confirmed its systems were \"not compromised in any way,\" the intent was clearly to gain unauthorized access to information or accounts related to Indigenous electoral participation. This directly impacts the civil liberty to participate in a free and fair democratic process, free from malicious interference. The incident underscores the broader cyber threat environment for the \"proposed referendum,\" emphasizing the need to protect all citizens' access to accurate information and secure electoral channels, particularly for vulnerable communities.\n\n**Government Actions: Alignment and Deviation from Progressive Values:**\n\n**Alignment with Progressive Values:**\n*   **Prompt and Targeted Response:** The AEC's immediate identification and containment of the phishing attempt, including the removal of malicious emails, demonstrates a commendable commitment to protecting electoral integrity.\n*   **Recognition of Specific Vulnerability:** The internal communications explicitly acknowledge the highly targeted nature of the attack on IEPP mailboxes and its potential link to the Voice referendum. This recognition aligns with progressive values by demonstrating awareness of and responsiveness to the unique vulnerabilities faced by First Nations communities in the digital and political landscape.\n*   **Inter-agency Collaboration:** The swift communication and collaboration with the Electoral Integrity Assurance Taskforce (EIAT) and the National Indigenous Australians Agency (NIAA) to share information and assess risks highlight a collective government effort to defend the democratic process, particularly where social justice issues are at stake. The NIAA\u2019s proactive request for clarity on the attack's purpose and risks further underscores this commitment.\n*   **Emphasis on Referendum Security:** The consistent messaging about the high cyber threat environment for the proposed referendum, comparable to a federal election, indicates a commitment to robust security measures for a significant event concerning Indigenous recognition.\n\n**Potential Deviations/Areas for Further Scrutiny:**\n*   **Inherent Vulnerability:** While the AEC's response was effective, the fact that IEPP mailboxes were perceived as a strategic target for such a \"sophisticated\" attack raises questions about potential pre-existing vulnerabilities or the level of proactive cyber protection in place for these critically important and sensitive communication channels. A progressive perspective might ask if enough preventative measures were in place to shield programs serving vulnerable populations.\n*   **Transparency Limitations:** The extensive redactions (s47E, s47F, s22) in the released documents, while common in FOI responses for national security and internal deliberative matters, limit full transparency. From a progressive standpoint, comprehensive public understanding of such incidents, especially those targeting specific communities and significant social reforms, is crucial for public trust and accountability. The extent of these redactions prevents a complete external audit of the threat landscape and the robustness of the response, potentially hindering public discourse on electoral security and civil liberties.\n\nIn conclusion, the documents reveal a concerning but contained cyber attack specifically targeting Indigenous electoral engagement channels ahead of a landmark referendum. The government's actions, through the AEC and its partners, largely align with progressive values of protecting democratic integrity and supporting Indigenous participation. However, the incident also underscores the ongoing need for vigilance, robust preventative measures, and greater transparency to safeguard the civil liberties and social justice aspirations of First Nations people in Australia's democratic processes.", "model": "gemini-2.5-flash", "generated_at": "2025-06-22T20:30:54.361262", "source_hash": "6194d225481007d65b2edc25b88657d669cc5d470ec093e4c24a0b5d07da5eda", "raw_response_path": "data/llm_responses/LEX3637__overall__left_leaning__20250622T203054.json", "output_tokens": 956, "prompt_tokens": 21762, "total_tokens": 24301, "summary_length": 5683}, "short_index": {"text": "The November 2022 spear phishing attack on the Australian Electoral Commission's Indigenous Electoral Participation Program (IEPP) mailboxes, described as \"very targeted\" and potentially linked to the Voice to Parliament referendum, exposes critical social justice and civil liberty concerns from a left-leaning perspective.

The AEC swiftly identified, contained, and internally managed a \"targeted and somewhat sophisticated\" cyberattack, which was an attempt at \"account harvesting\" or stealing personal information. This prompt action, initiated by staff reporting suspicious emails, prevented a system compromise, indicating effective cyber defenses and a proactive approach to protecting electoral infrastructure. Preventing a breach directly safeguards the integrity of the democratic process, a cornerstone of national security, and avoids the significant financial costs associated with recovering from a major cyber incident. The documents explicitly state, \"AEC systems were not compromised in any way,\" signifying a fiscally responsible outcome by preventing large-scale data breaches or operational disruptions that would incur substantial taxpayer expense. The engagement with the Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC) and internal discussions reinforce a serious approach to potential threats to Australia's electoral integrity.\n\n**Individual Liberty:**\nThe successful defense against this phishing attempt indirectly aligns with the principle of **individual liberty**. By protecting the integrity and security of the AEC's systems, particularly those related to voter engagement and participation (like the IEPP mailboxes), the government is upholding the freedom and security of citizens' participation in the electoral process. Preventing unauthorized access to government systems that may hold or process individual data is crucial for maintaining trust and protecting personal information, a vital component of individual liberty in the digital age.\n\n**Limited Government & Fiscal Responsibility (Potential Scrutiny):**\nWhile the immediate response to the cyber incident was efficient, a closer examination through a **limited government** and **fiscal responsibility** lens might raise questions about the broader bureaucratic framework. The extensive internal email chains, multiple levels of review, and numerous meetings (e.g., Electoral Integrity Committee, Electoral Integrity Assurance Taskforce, inter-departmental discussions with the National Indigenous Australians Agency) for a \"contained\" and \"uncompromised\" incident could be seen as an example of administrative overhead. While vigilance is necessary, the sheer volume of internal consultation for a non-breach event might suggest potential inefficiencies in bureaucratic processes. The documents indicate ongoing discussions about the \"cyber threat environment for the proposed referendum,\" which, while a legitimate concern for electoral integrity, could also be viewed as an expansion of government focus into broader \"mis/disinformation\" monitoring, potentially bordering on areas that, if unchecked, might infringe upon free speech or individual information flows, deviating from a strictly limited government role. However, within the scope of cybersecurity, this appears to be a legitimate defensive measure.

This suggests an intentional strategy to downplay the incident and limit public or inter-agency scrutiny.\n*   **Bureaucratic Bloat and Inefficiency:** The incident, a basic phishing attempt, generated numerous internal emails, required \"talking points\" for multiple internal and external meetings (EIAT Board, IDC), and involved multiple layers of approval for information sharing. The National Indigenous Australians Agency (NIAA) even had to ask for \"clarity re the purpose of the attack, trends, and what the overall risks are\" and to \"understand what the EIAT is and whether a referendum specific one is needed,\" indicating a lack of clear understanding or operational efficiency within the government's own \"integrity\" framework.\n*   **Hidden Vulnerabilities:** A revealing comment highlights that IPFS content (which may have been used in the phishing attack) is \"difficult to take down,\" requiring \"more effort than usual for cyberdefenders\" to reach all gateways for removal. This points to unaddressed, fundamental cyber vulnerabilities that are not being transparently communicated or effectively managed, instead being obscured by claims of \"systems not compromised.\"\n*   **Excessive Secrecy:** The sheer volume of redacted information, particularly under sections like s47F (personal information), s47E (deliberative processes), and s22 (irrelevant information), prevents a comprehensive understanding of the incident, the internal discussions, and the full extent of the government's response.

In November 2022, a sophisticated \"spear phishing\" email campaign, attempting to harvest account credentials, targeted the Australian Electoral Commission's (AEC) Indigenous Electoral Participation Program (IEPP) mailboxes.\n\nThis incident, while a challenge, clearly demonstrates the government's proactive and decisive approach to safeguarding critical digital infrastructure. Key takeaways include:\n\n1.  **Rapid Detection and Containment:** The threat was swiftly identified by vigilant AEC staff and immediately reported. Government cybersecurity teams initiated an investigation within hours, promptly confirming the malicious nature of the emails. Crucially, all targeted emails were removed from inboxes within a very short timeframe, preventing any potential compromise. The documents repeatedly confirm that **AEC systems were not compromised in any way**.\n2.  **Robust Security Protocols:** The seamless and effective handling of this incident is a testament to the government's commitment to and implementation of high-standard cybersecurity frameworks, such as the \"Essential Eight\" strategies mentioned in internal briefings. These necessary regulations and robust procedures ensured that a targeted attack was neutralized before any harm could occur.\n3.  **Collaborative Governance and Public Good:** The incident was promptly escalated and discussed across various government entities, including the Electoral Integrity Committee (EIC) and the Electoral Integrity Assurance Taskforce (EIAT). Briefings were also provided to the National Indigenous Australians Agency (NIAA), demonstrating a coordinated, whole-of-government approach to address and learn from such challenges.

Far from demonstrating competence, the records paint a picture of reactive, rather than proactive, security measures and a deliberate attempt to control the narrative around a serious breach attempt.\n\n**Initial Vulnerability and Delayed Detection:**\nOn 14 November 2022, malicious actors launched a highly targeted spear phishing campaign directly at the AEC's eight Indigenous Electoral Participation Program (IEPP) mailboxes. These accounts, critical for engagement with Indigenous communities, were explicitly chosen targets. Shockingly, the AEC's vaunted cyber defences failed to prevent or even immediately detect this attack. Instead, the incident was first reported by a vigilant Victorian State Office staff member at 6:19 PM on 15 November, nearly **20 hours** after the emails were sent. This reliance on human vigilance rather than automated, robust security systems is a damning indictment of the AEC's cybersecurity posture, especially on such critical and sensitive accounts.\n\n**Sluggish and Incompetent Response:**\nEven once alerted, the AEC's response was glacially slow. Initial investigations didn't commence until 8:15 AM on 16 November, over **14 hours** after the staff member's report. The removal of the malicious emails from the compromised mailboxes wasn't completed until 9:50 AM on 16 November, almost **35 hours** after the initial attack. This protracted response time for a \"targeted and sophisticated\" account harvesting attempt on high-profile mailboxes suggests significant procedural and technical incompetence, leaving sensitive channels vulnerable for an unacceptably long period. An internal email even reflects this inadequacy, stating, \"I'll take this as a lesson for all of us who manage security systems,\" revealing a reactive 'lessons learned' approach rather than a foundation of pre-emptive strength.\n\n**Internal Disarray and Information Control:**\nThe documents reveal a chaotic internal communication environment. Initial emails show basic 'FYI' sharing, with no clear, immediate chain of command or a sense of urgency befitting a targeted attack. Later communications indicate that information sharing with external, but relevant, bodies like the Electoral Integrity Assurance Taskforce (EIAT) and the National Indigenous Australians Agency (NIAA) was delayed and heavily sanitized. The AEC explicitly \"removed unnecessary detail about the AEC\u2019s internal response\" from information shared with EIAT, suggesting a deliberate effort to conceal operational failures. The NIAA had to actively pursue answers about the attack and the EIAT's role, indicating a lack of proactive transparency from the AEC. Furthermore, internal email chains reveal confusion and delays in simply preparing \"talking points\" for senior officials months after the incident, highlighting a profound bureaucratic inertia.\n\n**Obfuscation and Secrecy:**\nThe sheer volume of redactions (s47E, s47F, s22) and outright refusal of access (s7(2A)(a)(vii)) to multiple documents related to this incident is a hallmark of an institution with something to hide. Details on \"blocked emails\" and deeper insights into the Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC) interaction have been withheld, raising suspicions that the full extent of the vulnerability or the criticisms from higher authorities are being deliberately suppressed. The AEC\u2019s repeated assertion that \"systems were not compromised in any way\" clashes with the fact that malicious emails were actively residing in their inboxes for an extended period, requiring manual removal due to the difficulty of taking down \"IPFS content.\" This suggests a fundamental weakness in email security and a disingenuous public narrative.\n\n**Damning Implications for the Referendum:**\nThe most damning implication is the direct targeting of Indigenous mailboxes ahead of the Voice to Parliament referendum. The AEC itself acknowledges this possibility, stating, \"It is possible it relates to the proposed referendum given the targeting of AEC\u2019s Indigenous Electoral Participation Program mailboxes.\" Yet, the documents reveal a slow, manual, and reactive defence against an attack that could have severely impacted the integrity and perception of the referendum process among Indigenous communities.
