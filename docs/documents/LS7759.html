*   <strong>Document 23 &amp; 24:</strong> Tables summarizing and breaking down the results of membership testing (04/03/2019-20/03/2019 &amp; 20/03/2019).<br />
*   <strong>Document 25:</strong> Internal Minute to the delegate recommending refusal of the application in its current form under s 131 of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 (21/03/2019).<br />
*   <strong>Document 26:</strong> Notice sent to the registered officer of the 'Stop Selling Australia' party under s 131 of the Electoral Act (29/03/2019).<br />
*   <strong>Document 27 &amp; 28:</strong> Notices regarding suspension and recommencement of application processing due to the 2019 federal election (12/04/2019 &amp; 24/06/2019).</p>
<h2>Main Content Related to the FOI Request</h2>
<p>The documents detail the Australian Electoral Commission's (AEC) process of assessing the 'Stop Selling Australia' party's application for registration, specifically focusing on its compliance with the requirement of having at least 500 members who are on the Commonwealth Electoral Roll.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Application and Membership List:</strong> The 'Stop Selling Australia' party submitted an application for registration, including a membership list. After initial checks and subsequent updates provided by the party, a list of 550 members was processed.</li>
<li><strong>Electoral Roll Matching:</strong> The AEC's Roll Management Section (RMANS) conducted checks against the electoral roll.<ul>
<li>An email dated 24 January 2019 showed 406 members matched, 133 had no match, and 11 had multiple matches out of 550.</li>
<li>A later email dated 28 February 2019 indicated 404 matched, 135 no match, and 11 multiple matches.</li>
<li>Ultimately, after manual identification efforts, <strong>503 members were identified as being on the electoral roll</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Membership Testing (Direct Contact):</strong> To verify the membership, the AEC conducted a random sample test.<ul>
<li>Based on ABS methodology, a sample size of <strong>26 members</strong> was required for direct contact, with a maximum of <strong>1 denial</strong> of membership permitted for the party to pass.</li>
<li>The AEC attempted to contact <strong>52 members</strong> in total, as some were uncontactable. Emails (Document 22) were sent to individuals requesting confirmation of membership.</li>
<li>Document 21 highlights a critical case: one individual initially provided a seemingly neutral email response, but a subsequent phone call (as per the FOI request's interest in phone responses) revealed they <strong>denied being a member</strong> of 'Stop Selling Australia'.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Results and Outcome:</strong><ul>
<li>Out of the contacted sample, <strong>24 members confirmed</strong> their membership.</li>
<li>However, <strong>2 members denied</strong> their membership, exceeding the permitted single denial.</li>
<li><strong>Therefore, the 'Stop Selling Australia' party's application "FAILED" the membership testing assessment.</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>AEC Decision:</strong> As detailed in Document 25 (Minute to delegate) and Document 26 (s 131 Notice), the AEC determined that the application, in its current form, did not satisfy the requirements of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918, primarily due to failing the membership test. The AEC issued a notice under subsection 131(1) of the Act, advising the party that the application would be refused in its current form but offering the opportunity to vary the application (e.g., provide a new, compliant membership list) to avoid refusal.</li>

    <div class="ai-summary-markdown-content">
      <p>The provided FOI documents detail the Australian Electoral Commission's (AEC) process for assessing the registration application of the "Stop Selling Australia" party, specifically focusing on the rigorous membership verification phase. From a left-leaning analytical perspective, these documents highlight both the government's commitment to core democratic principles and potential areas where policy might inadvertently create barriers to political participation.</p>
<p><strong>Civil Liberties and Democratic Integrity:</strong><br />
The central theme across these documents is the government's role in upholding the integrity of the electoral system. The AEC's meticulous process for verifying party membership – including matching member lists against the electoral roll (Documents 9, 14, 25), contacting a random sample of members for confirmation (Documents 20, 21, 22), and applying a strict threshold for permissible denials (Document 24) – demonstrates a commitment to fair and legitimate political processes. The refusal of the "Stop Selling Australia" party's application (Documents 24, 25, 26) was not based on the party's political platform or ideology, but solely on its failure to meet the statutory requirement for validated membership. Specifically, out of a required sample of 26 members, the party recorded 2 denials, exceeding the single denial permitted, thus failing the test (Document 24). This adherence to a transparent and consistent rule-of-law framework aligns strongly with progressive values that demand a robust, accountable, and non-arbitrary democratic system. The AEC's clear communication with the party throughout the process (Document 5) and the subsequent release of these internal documents via FOI further underscore a commitment to government transparency.</p>
<p><strong>Social Justice and Accessibility of Political Participation:</strong><br />
While the AEC's process is vital for preventing fraudulent registrations, a progressive lens might raise questions about the practical implications for nascent or grassroots political movements. The strict numerical threshold for membership (500 members on the roll) and the low tolerance for sampling errors (only one denial permitted in a sample of 26) can present a significant barrier to entry for smaller, less resourced parties. While the "Stop Selling Australia" party reportedly had 503 valid members after initial checks (Document 24), the failure occurred during the random sampling validation. This strictness, while ensuring integrity, could be seen as inadvertently favoring established parties with larger, more stable memberships and administrative capacity, potentially stifling the emergence of new voices or movements that may represent marginalized perspectives or challenge the political status quo. A progressive approach might advocate for balancing democratic integrity with accessibility, exploring whether alternative validation methods or support mechanisms could facilitate broader political participation without compromising legitimacy.</p>
<p><strong>Privacy and Data Protection:</strong><br />
The documents also touch upon civil liberties in the context of privacy. The AEC explicitly stated it could not provide the party with a list of members who were not auto-matched to the electoral roll due to "privacy reasons" (Document 5). This demonstrates a governmental commitment to protecting individuals' personal data, even from the political organizations they claim to be a part of, which is a key progressive value in the digital age.</p>
<p><strong>Environmental Impact, Wealth Distribution, and Corporate Influence:</strong><br />
The documents are largely procedural and do not offer insights into issues related to environmental impact, wealth distribution, or corporate influence. The party's name, "Stop Selling Australia," hints at concerns that <em>could</em> align with progressive views on national sovereignty, anti-privatization, or wealth retention, but the documents do not detail the party's platform or specific aims. Therefore, no direct alignment or deviation regarding these specific progressive values can be inferred from the provided records.</p>

    <div class="ai-summary-markdown-content">
      <p>As a right-leaning analyst, a review of these FOI documents concerning the attempted registration of the 'Stop Selling Australia' party reveals several aspects of government operation that both align with and, in some nuanced ways, challenge conservative principles.</p>
<p><strong>Economic Efficiency:</strong><br />
The Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) demonstrates a commitment to administrative efficiency through its use of automated data matching systems (RMANS) and statistical sampling methodologies (derived from ABS) for verifying party membership. This approach streamlines the process of checking a large membership list against the electoral roll, reflecting a practical application of technology to manage bureaucratic tasks. However, the need for manual checks for unmatched members (Doc 25) and multiple rounds of communication with the party to rectify list deficiencies (Doc 5) highlight areas where initial inefficiencies from the applicant's side can consume additional public resources, demonstrating that even well-designed systems can be impacted by external data quality.</p>
<p><strong>Individual Liberty:</strong><br />
The documents show the AEC upholding individual liberty through its rigorous membership verification process. By directly contacting a random sample of individuals and explicitly requesting their confirmation of membership (Docs 20, 22), the AEC ensures that individuals are not listed as party members without their explicit consent. This protects individual autonomy and prevents potentially fraudulent or unauthorized affiliations. Furthermore, the AEC's stated policy of not disclosing the names of members whose details could not be matched to the electoral roll, citing "privacy reasons" (Doc 5), strongly aligns with conservative values of protecting personal data and individual privacy from unnecessary government or third-party disclosure. The instance of a sampled individual denying membership upon follow-up (Doc 21) further validates the necessity of these checks in safeguarding individual rights.</p>
<p><strong>National Security:</strong><br />
While the documents primarily detail the AEC's administrative processes, the very name of the party, 'Stop Selling Australia,' implicitly signals a focus on economic sovereignty and potentially national security concerns, likely in opposition to foreign ownership or perceived threats to national assets. From a conservative standpoint, such a platform's emphasis on national interest and control over national resources can resonate. The AEC's role here is to ensure that any group, regardless of its platform (as long as it operates within legal bounds), can participate in the democratic process if it meets the established, objective criteria. This reflects a commitment to a robust, open political marketplace where diverse views, including those focused on national security, can compete, provided they adhere to the rules.</p>
<p><strong>Fiscal Responsibility:</strong><br />
The AEC's methodical and rule-bound approach to party registration underscores fiscal responsibility. By requiring a minimum of 500 verified members on the electoral roll and applying a strict statistical test (permitting only one denial in the sample, Doc 24, 25), the AEC ensures that public funds and the integrity of the electoral system are not wasted on registering non-viable or potentially unserious political entities. The application fee (Doc 25) also contributes to offsetting administrative costs. The refusal of the 'Stop Selling Australia' party's application due to failing this core membership test (two denials against one permitted, Doc 24, 25) demonstrates a commitment to accountability and prudence in public administration, ensuring that only genuinely supported parties gain official recognition.</p>
<p><strong>Limited Government:</strong><br />
The documents provide a clear illustration of limited government in action. The AEC operates strictly within the confines of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918, meticulously adhering to statutory requirements for party registration (Doc 25, citing sections 4, 123, 126, 129, 131). The process for assessing the party's constitution, name, and membership is transparent and defined by law, not by arbitrary bureaucratic discretion. The decision to refuse the application in its current form, based on objective criteria (failure to meet membership threshold) and offering an opportunity for the party to rectify the deficiencies (s 131 notice, Doc 25, 26), exemplifies due process. This demonstrates a government acting as an impartial arbiter of rules, ensuring fair play in the democratic system without overreaching its mandate or suppressing political expression. The temporary suspension of processing due to the federal election writs (Doc 27) and subsequent recommencement (Doc 28) further highlights adherence to established legal procedures, reinforcing the principle of government operating under the rule of law.</p>

    <div class="ai-summary-markdown-content">
      <p>The FOI documents reveal a protracted and overly bureaucratic process by the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) in handling the 'Stop Selling Australia' party's registration application, highlighting a potential for inefficiency, lack of transparency, and rigid application of rules that hinders new political movements.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Protracted &amp; Inefficient Bureaucracy:</strong> The application process spanned over four months (November 2018 to March 2019) for a party that seemingly met most requirements. Initial automated roll checks only matched 70% of the party's members, requiring extensive manual verification that the AEC itself admitted "impacted the expected time to process" (Document 5, Page 4). This points to either inefficient internal systems or an excessive data quality burden placed on aspiring parties.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Lack of Transparency &amp; Obstructive Policies:</strong> The AEC explicitly refused to provide the party with a list of members who could not be verified on the electoral roll, citing "privacy reasons" (Document 5, Page 2-3). This policy, while perhaps adhering to a narrow interpretation of privacy, actively undermined the party's ability to efficiently correct its membership list, forcing them to perform their own time-consuming checks without precise feedback from the official body. This places an unnecessary obstacle in the path of new political organizations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Arbitrary &amp; Overly Rigid Application of Rules:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Despite the AEC's own checks confirming <strong>503 enrolled members</strong> for the party (exceeding the 500-member minimum threshold for registration) (Document 25, Page 3), the application was ultimately refused.</li>
<li>The refusal stemmed from a disproportionately strict interpretation of membership sampling. While the statistical formula required a sample of 26 members with only one denial permitted, the AEC <strong>attempted to contact 52 members</strong>—double the required sample size—citing "uncontactable" members (Document 24, Page 3; Document 25, Page 3).</li>
<li>From these 52 attempts, 24 confirmations were received, but critically, <strong>two denials</strong> were recorded. One denial was even secured through a follow-up phone call to a previously "neutral" respondent (Document 21), suggesting a persistent effort to identify non-confirming members. This hyper-scrupulous approach, contacting double the required sample and pursuing a denial to reach an arbitrary limit, appears to prioritize bureaucratic adherence over facilitating legitimate political participation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Waste of Public and Private Resources:</strong> The extensive internal reviews, multiple data submissions, manual checks, and prolonged membership verification process, culminating in a refusal based on a single additional denial in an <em>oversized</em> sample, represents a significant expenditure of taxpayer money and administrative resources. This bureaucratic overreach and a seemingly adversarial approach to a party that otherwise met the core numerical requirement constitutes questionable decision-making and a waste of both government and the party's resources.</p>

      <p>These FOI documents highlight the Australian Electoral Commission's (AEC) diligent and robust processes in managing the registration of political parties, ensuring effective governance and upholding the integrity of Australia's democratic system.</p>
<p>The documents detail the AEC's assessment of the 'Stop Selling Australia' party's application for registration. From the outset, the AEC demonstrated its commitment to facilitating legitimate political participation by providing clear guidance and maintaining open communication with the party. Initial interactions, as seen in the email chains (Doc 5), show the AEC actively assisting the party in submitting an accurate membership list, demonstrating a supportive approach to compliance.</p>
<p>A cornerstone of the AEC's responsibilities is to ensure that political parties meet the statutory requirements, particularly the minimum membership threshold. The documents reveal the AEC's meticulous, multi-layered approach to membership verification:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rigorous Data Matching (Docs 1, 9, 14):</strong> The AEC efficiently employed sophisticated systems like RMANS and conducted manual checks (GENESIS) to cross-reference the party's submitted membership list against the Commonwealth Electoral Roll. This thorough process ensures that only genuinely enrolled electors are counted as members, safeguarding the electoral roll's accuracy and preventing misrepresentation.</li>
<li><strong>Direct Member Verification (Docs 20, 21, 22):</strong> Beyond data matching, the AEC undertook the essential step of contacting a random sample of members directly via email and phone. This direct contact mechanism is a critical control measure, preventing inflated or erroneous membership claims and protecting individual privacy by confirming their affiliation.</li>
<li><strong>Transparent Reporting (Docs 23, 24):</strong> The results of this rigorous testing were meticulously compiled and presented, clearly indicating that the 'Stop Selling Australia' party's membership, after verification, did not meet the necessary threshold as per the <em>Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918</em>. This is not a "controversy," but rather a demonstration of the regulatory process working as intended, ensuring all parties meet the same fair, legislated standards.</li>
</ul>
<p>Following the comprehensive assessment, the AEC's internal minute (Doc 25) clearly outlines the rational and legal basis for the decision, confirming that while the party's constitution and name met requirements, the critical membership criteria were not satisfied. This structured decision-making process underscores the AEC's adherence to the rule of law.</p>
<p>Crucially, the AEC's response was not an immediate refusal. Instead, the AEC issued a notice (Doc 26) under Section 131 of the <em>Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918</em>, offering the 'Stop Selling Australia' party the opportunity to rectify the identified deficiencies, specifically related to its membership. This exemplifies the government's commitment to due process and fairness, providing applicants with a chance to meet regulatory standards.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the documents (Docs 27, 28) show how the AEC seamlessly managed the processing of the application around the 2019 federal election. By suspending and then recommencing the application process in accordance with Section 127 of the Act, the AEC demonstrated its unwavering commitment to maintaining the integrity of the election cycle while ensuring that party registration applications are handled appropriately within the statutory framework.</p>
<p>In summary, these FOI documents showcase the government's dedication to effective governance through the AEC's transparent, diligent, and legally compliant processes. Every step, from initial application review to rigorous membership verification and fair communication of decisions, is undertaken to serve the public interest by ensuring the integrity and legitimacy of Australia's political parties and, by extension, its democratic foundations.</p>

      <p>The documents reveal a bureaucratic gauntlet designed to obstruct new political parties through a combination of systemic incompetence, deliberate opaqueness, and excessively punitive standards.</p>
<p>The Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) process for registering the 'Stop Selling Australia' party was plagued by significant failures:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Flagrant Data Inconsistency and Systemic Incompetence:</strong> A comparison of document #9 (24/01/2019) and document #14 (28/02/2019) reveals a damning discrepancy. The <em>same</em> membership list, tested against the electoral roll a month apart, yielded <em>different</em> "matched" and "no match" numbers (406 vs 404 matched; 133 vs 135 no match). This is irrefutable evidence of either a fundamental flaw in the AEC's "RMANS" (Roll Management Automated National System), a shocking lack of data integrity, or unacknowledged changes in the roll-checking methodology. Furthermore, document #14 explicitly admits "RMANS does not allow for the retention of highlighted fields," indicating antiquated, non-functional IT systems that actively hinder internal communication and efficient problem-solving.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Intentional Obstruction and Lack of Transparency:</strong> The AEC deliberately withheld crucial information from the party. Document #5 shows the party explicitly asked to be "notified of which members don't meet your requirements," only to be flatly refused "for privacy reasons." This forces the party into a blind re-verification process, putting the entire burden of rectifying errors onto them without providing actionable intelligence. This is not assistance; it is a calculated impediment, leveraging privacy as an excuse for bureaucratic inefficiency or a deliberate barrier to entry. The AEC's advice that it "can save a party several weeks in delays if the party does its own check" is an implicit admission that their own process is inherently slow and burdensome, pushing their responsibility onto the applicant.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Flawed and Punitive Verification Methodology:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The "membership testing" process was a complete failure. Document #24 states that the AEC "attempted to contact 52 members" (twice the required random sample of 26), yet only received 26 responses (24 confirmations, 2 denials). This means half of the people contacted by the AEC were unresponsive or uncontactable, highlighting a severe deficiency in the AEC's communication strategy or the quality of the contact information it demanded.</li>
<li>Document #21 lays bare the inadequacy of the email verification method. One member, initially assessed as a "neutral contact" via email, outright "denied being a member" when subsequently contacted by phone. This single instance exposes the email-based system as prone to misinterpretation and inaccurate results, potentially inflating the "confirmations" and leading to an artificially positive initial assessment. The fact that a phone call only happened on "recommendation" rather than as a standard practice for ambiguous responses further reveals a reactive, rather than robust, verification process.</li>
<li>The "one denial permitted" rule (Doc #24, #25) is an excessively stringent and arbitrary criterion for a party requiring 500 members. It sets an almost impossibly high bar, ensuring that minor discrepancies or even genuine misunderstandings by just two individuals lead to the entire application's failure, regardless of hundreds of confirmed members. This rule appears designed to exclude rather than facilitate.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Excessive Delays and Bureaucratic Stalling:</strong> The application, submitted in November 2018, dragged on for months, finally failing in March 2019. This timeline was exacerbated by multiple "updated membership list" submissions (Doc #5, #25), some caused by basic administrative errors (AEC's "no membership list attached" response in Doc #5), and others by the AEC's drawn-out, opaque verification cycles. While external factors like election writs (Doc #27, #28) contributed to some delays, the preceding four months of processing were already a testament to the AEC's glacial pace and the convoluted nature of its requirements. The final decision to "set aside" the application rather than offer a clear path to immediate rectification is a final bureaucratic insult, forcing the party into a virtual re-application.</p>

as the AEC have received an application to register Stop Selling Australia as a federal political party. 

Under section 123 of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 a registered political party must have at 
least 500 members who are on the Commonwealth Electoral Roll. 

To verify a party’s membership list, the AEC checks a random sample of the membership list provided 
by the party. 

Stop Selling Australia provided your name on its membership list and your name has been selected at 
random. To verify that you are a member of the party, please reply to this email with the response 
that applies to you: 

1.    My name is ………

Disclosure, Assurance and Engagement 

For Action – application under subsection 126(3) of the Commonwealth
Electoral Act 1918 (the Electoral Act) for registration as a political party 
– issue of notice allowing variation of application – Stop Selling Australia
Party

Purpose 
This minute asks you, as a delegate of the Electoral Commission, to give notice to the applicant 
of the Stop Selling Australia Party (the Party) under subsection 131(1) of the Electoral Act. This 
notice will give the Party the opportunity to vary the application so refusal of the application may 
not be required. 

Authority 
Sections 4, 123, 126, 129 and 131 and subsections 4(1) and 123(1) of the Electoral Act. 

Background 
On 24 November 2018, the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) received all of the 
requirements from the Party for an application for registration as a non-Parliamentary party 
under paragraph 126(1)(b) of the Electoral Act (folio 52). The application included a copy of the 
Party’s constitution (folio 16), an electronic list of between 500-550 members and a statutory 
declaration from the proposed Party secr tary regarding the authenticity of these documents 
(folio 21). The Party indicated that it did not wish to register an abbreviation or party logo  
(folio 32).  On 23 January 2019 and 22 February 2019 the Party provided updates to its 
membership list which impacted on  he  ime taken to assess the application.  

Initial assessment of application 
In the case of a non-Parliamen ary party paragraph 126(1)(b) of the Electoral Act provides that 
the application may be made by 10 members of the party, of whom one is the secretary of the 
party. The application is made by 10 members of the Party, one of which is the Party secretary, 
and sets out the names and addresses of the applicants, and particulars of the capacity in which 
each applicant makes the application (folio 30).  

Assessment of constitution 
Sections 4 and 123 of the Electoral Act define an eligible political party as an organisation the 
object or activity, or one of the objects or activities, of which is the promotion of the election to 
the Senate or to the House of Representatives of a candidate or candidates endorsed by it.  

Subsection 123(1) of the Electoral Act defines an eligible political party as a political party that is 
“established on the basis of a written constitution (however described) that sets out the aims of 
the party”. 

The Party’s constitution meets this requirement because:

Releasd under the Freedom of Information Act 1982LS7759 Document No. 25


--- Page 2 ---

•

clause 3.2.16 states an objective of the Party is to “endorse Party candidates for Local,
State and Federal elections” (folio 12).

Assessment of proposed party name  
Name sought: Stop Selling Australia Party  
Section 129 of the Electoral Act prohibits the registration of parties with certain names and 
abbreviations. An assessment of the proposed name was undertaken to ensure it did not 
contravene s 129. The proposed name: 

a) does not comprise more than six words
b)
c)

is not obscene
is not the name, abbreviation or acronym of the name of another political party (not
being a political party that is related to the party to which the application relates) that is a
recognised political party

d) does not so nearly resemble the name, abbreviation or acronym of the name of another

political party (not being a political party that is related to the party to which the
application relates) that is a recognised political party that it is likely to be confused with
or mistaken for that name or that abbreviation or acronym, as the case may be

da) is not one that a reasonable person would think suggests a connection or relationship 
exists between the party and a registered party if that connection or relationship does 
not in fact exist 

e) does not comprise the words ‘Independent Party’ or comprise or contain the word

‘Independent’ and:

i.

the name, or an abbreviation or acronym of the name, of a recognised political
party; or

ii. matter that so nearly resembles the name, or an abbreviation or acronym of the
name, of a recognised political party  hat the matter is likely to be confused with
or mistaken for that name or that abbreviation or acronym, as the case may be.

The federal Register was checked (folios 126-128) and that of each state and territory 
(folios 103-124) for parties with a similar name or abbreviation.  

The following party names contained the word “stop”: 

• Stop Population Growth Now Party (Electoral Commission of South Australia) (folio 110).

The following party abbreviations contained the word “stop”: 

• Stop Population Growth Now (Electoral Commission of South Australia) (folio 110).

The above parties share the word “stop” but share no further similarities with the Party’s 
proposed name. The Party’s proposed name is not the same as that of a recognised political 
party. Furthe , there is enough of a difference between the Party’s name and the above name 
and abbreviation that it is not likely to be confused or mistaken, and a reasonable person would 
not think that a connection or relationship exists between the parties.   

Based on this information the Party’s name is not prohibited under s 129 of the Electoral Act. 

Assessment of membership 
Subsection 123(1) of the Electoral Act defines an eligible political party as a political party that is 
either a Parliamentary party or has at least 500 members. Paragraph 126(2)(ca) of the Electoral 

Page 2    Minute 

Releasd under the Freedom of Information Act 1982LS7759 Document No. 25


--- Page 3 ---

Act states that an application for registration must “include a list of the names of the 500 
members of the party to be relied on for the purposes of registration”.  

The membership list submitted by the Party contained 550 members. This list was checked 
automatically using RMANS, with 404 members identified on the electoral roll. A further 117 
members were manually identified on the electoral roll using GENESIS while 29 members were 
unable to be matched to the roll.  

Fifteen members were identified as duplicates within the list and three members were identified 
as cross party duplicates. See folio 100 for a breakdown of the membership numbers.  

A list of 503 members requires contact with a random sample of 26 members under the formula 
provided by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (folio 94). For the AEC to be satisfied that the 
Party has the required 500 members, one denial of membership is permitted.  

The relevant numbers for this membership test were: 

1.
2.
3.

the random sample size was 26
the AEC attempted to contact 52 members, as some members were uncontactable
the highest 26 responses were:
24 confirmed membership
-
two denied membership.
-

A record of those contacted is at folio 96. Based on this information the Party’s membership list 
failed the membership testing assessment of the applica ion process. 

The Party’s application will be set aside until the def ciencies identified are rectified and an 
updated membership list is either resubmitted or  he application withdrawn. This will be raised 
with the Party in the s 131 notice  

Other procedural application requirements 
The application meets the requirements of paragraphs 126(2)(c), 126(2)(d), 126(2)(e) and 
126(2)(g) of the Electoral Act as it:  
•

set out the name and address of the person who is to be the registered officer of the Party
for the purposes of the Electoral Act
advised that the Party wishes to receive moneys under Division 3 of Part XX of the Electoral
Act
set out the names and addresses of the applicants and particulars of the capacity in which
each applicant makes the application, and

•

•

• was accompanied by a fee of $500.

Conclusion 
An assessment of the Party’s application was undertaken and it was determined that: 
•
•
•

the Party s constitution meets the requirements of s 4 and s 123 of the Electoral Act
he Party’s name is not prohibited under s 129 of the Electoral Act
the Party does not meet the membership requirements of subsection 123(1) and paragraph
126(2)(ca) of the Electoral Act
the application meets the requirements of paragraphs 126(2)(c),126(2)(d),126(2)(e) and
126(2)(g) of the Electoral Act.

•

Based on this information, the Party’s application, in its current form, does not satisfy the 
requirements of Part XI of the Electoral Act.

Subsections 131(1) and (3) of the Electoral Act provide that where the Electoral Commission is 
of the opinion that the application should be refused, the Electoral Commission shall give written 
notice to the applicant that it is of that opinion and that the applicant may lodge a written request 
varying the application in the manner specified. 

The s 131 notice will advise the Party it has the option to: 

•
•

vary the application in the manner specified in the request; or
proceed with the application in the form in which it was lodged.

Good afternoon 

If the membership list falls short of the required 500 members following the manual checks conducted by the AEC 
then the Party would be expected to be a notice under s 131 of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 (the Electoral 
Act) indicating that provides the Party an opportunity to rectify any issues with the application (such as not being 
assured the Party has at least 500 members who are electors). Further details regarding s 131 notices is on page 18 
of the Party Registration Guide. As previously advised, the Party would be provided details of the membership 
testing outcome but would not be provided details relating to specific members. 

Please advise if the Party still intends to submit a fresh membership list or would like the AEC to proceed with the 
list submitted as part of the Party’s application.

Morning 

Thanks for your email, can you please confirm the following; 

If the membership list falls short of the required 500 members following your check are we notified of which 
members don’t meet your requirements? ( you mentioned privacy issues however these people are our members 
and have already supplied their personal details) 

Because we have more members then what’s been supplied to you are we able to make up any short fall with 
members not on that list, i.e. if the list is 30 short due to the reasons you listed are we able to supply an addition 30 
then to make up the required 500?  

Can you confirm the re application process in the event of a membership shortfall.

Good morning 

Unfortunately the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) cannot provide a list of the members who were identified 
by AEC systems on the Party’s list as being on the Commonwealth Electoral Roll (or not auto-matched to the 
Commonwealth Electoral Roll) for privacy reasons. 

Please let me know if the Party still intends to review its membership list or would like the AEC to undertake 
individual checks against the Commonwealth Electoral Roll. After undertaking an individual manual check of the 
Commonwealth Electoral Roll the AEC will assess if these members will fall into one of four categories:  

• Matched to the Commonwealth Electoral Roll;
• Deceased;
• Not currently enrolled to vote; or
• Not found on the roll.

As previously advised the Party will require a minimum of 500 members from the list of 549 to be identified as being 
on the Commonwealth Electoral Roll for further membership testing to continue.

Thank you for your call today in relation to our membership list. Can you provide me with the list that has been 
confirmed on the role as opposed to ones who aren’t? 

Interesting I just did a check on myself &amp; it didn’t come up &amp; I am definitely registered at my home address? Once 
we have the members in question we will start the process of contacting them ourselves.

Good afternoon 

As discussed, the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) has commenced testing the list of members provided by the 
Stop Selling Australia Party (the Party). Of the 549 entries on the list of people provided by the Party in support of its 
application 384 have been automatically matched to the Commonwealth Electoral Roll. Details for 167 of the entries 
of people provided by the Party in the current membership list require further manual checking by the AEC. For the 
AEC to undertake 165 manual checks on the current list will impact the expected time to process the Party’s 
application. It also indicates that some of the details for these members are deficient or erroneous as they have not 
been automatically matched to the Commonwealth Electoral Roll. Should the AEC not be assured that more than 
500 members are electors (currently on the Commonwealth Electoral Roll) results in a party failing the membership 
test.  

Can you please advise if you would like the AEC to continue to process the list submitted by the Party or if the Party 
will provide an alternate membership list as part of its application. The AEC will set aside the Party’s application until 
it receives an alternate membership list or is advised to continue testing the current list. 

The party can use the details in the membership list to check that each member is enrolled by using the check my 
electoral enrolment facility or eRoll which is available in all AEC offices. Party members used to support the 
application must be listed on the Commonwealth Electoral Roll. It can save a party several weeks in delays if the 
party does its own check of its members’ electoral enrolment online or at an AEC office.

Dear 

Thank you for providing the attached Appoint Party Agent Form. As discussed, for the Australian Electoral 
Commission (AEC) to process the Stop Selling Australia Party’s application, can you please provide the AEC: 

• An electronic list of between 500 and 550 members of the Party (the AEC notes the list provided 22 November

2018 contained 571 members), and 

• Written confirmation that you are being appointed as registered officer for the Party (as this field was missing

from the Application for Registration as a Non-Parliamentary Party form). 

If you have any queries please contact the AEC on 02 6271 4552 or email fad@aec.gov.au.

After initial checks and subsequent updates provided by the party, a list of 550 members was processed.\n2.  **Electoral Roll Matching:** The AEC's Roll Management Section (RMANS) conducted checks against the electoral roll.\n    *   An email dated 24 January 2019 showed 406 members matched, 133 had no match, and 11 had multiple matches out of 550.\n    *   A later email dated 28 February 2019 indicated 404 matched, 135 no match, and 11 multiple matches.\n    *   Ultimately, after manual identification efforts, **503 members were identified as being on the electoral roll**.\n3.  **Membership Testing (Direct Contact):** To verify the membership, the AEC conducted a random sample test.\n    *   Based on ABS methodology, a sample size of **26 members** was required for direct contact, with a maximum of **1 denial** of membership permitted for the party to pass.\n    *   The AEC attempted to contact **52 members** in total, as some were uncontactable. Emails (Document 22) were sent to individuals requesting confirmation of membership.\n    *   Document 21 highlights a critical case: one individual initially provided a seemingly neutral email response, but a subsequent phone call (as per the FOI request's interest in phone responses) revealed they **denied being a member** of 'Stop Selling Australia'.\n4.  **Results and Outcome:**\n    *   Out of the contacted sample, **24 members confirmed** their membership.\n    *   However, **2 members denied** their membership, exceeding the permitted single denial.\n    *   **Therefore, the 'Stop Selling Australia' party's application \"FAILED\" the membership testing assessment.**\n5.  **AEC Decision:** As detailed in Document 25 (Minute to delegate) and Document 26 (s 131 Notice), the AEC determined that the application, in its current form, did not satisfy the requirements of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918, primarily due to failing the membership test. The AEC issued a notice under subsection 131(1) of the Act, advising the party that the application would be refused in its current form but offering the opportunity to vary the application (e.g., provide a new, compliant membership list) to avoid refusal.", "model": "gemini-2.5-flash", "generated_at": "2025-06-22T22:04:47.878443", "source_hash": "2da7aa5dd640fa6efe9e4f4f1e1bb4a67f00e186472f901db4a3ff633bbece2b", "raw_response_path": "data/llm_responses/LS7759__overall__balanced__20250622T220447.json", "output_tokens": 1240, "prompt_tokens": 16725, "total_tokens": 19820, "summary_length": 4858}, "short_index": {"text": "FOI request LS7759 sought documents regarding the 'Stop Selling Australia' party's attempted registration, specifically focusing on the Australian Electoral Commission's (AEC) \"member checking phase.\" The released documents detail the AEC's process, including the party's application, electoral roll matching (which found 503 eligible members), and crucial direct membership testing. Despite initial compliance on roll numbers, a required sample of 26 members for direct contact allowed for a maximum of one denial of membership. However, out of 52 members contacted, two individuals denied their membership (one confirmed via phone call), exceeding the permissible limit. Consequently, the 'Stop Selling Australia' party \"FAILED\" the membership testing, leading the AEC to recommend refusal of their application under section 131 of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918, while offering the party an opportunity to vary their application to avoid outright refusal.", "model": "gemini-2.5-flash", "generated_at": "2025-06-22T22:04:53.561802", "source_hash": "2da7aa5dd640fa6efe9e4f4f1e1bb4a67f00e186472f901db4a3ff633bbece2b", "raw_response_path": "data/llm_responses/LS7759__short_index__balanced__20250622T220453.json", "output_tokens": 189, "prompt_tokens": 1282, "total_tokens": 1720, "summary_length": 963}}, "left_leaning": {"overall": {"text": "The provided FOI documents detail the Australian Electoral Commission's (AEC) process for assessing the registration application of the \"Stop Selling Australia\" party, specifically focusing on the rigorous membership verification phase. From a left-leaning analytical perspective, these documents highlight both the government's commitment to core democratic principles and potential areas where policy might inadvertently create barriers to political participation.\n\n**Civil Liberties and Democratic Integrity:**\nThe central theme across these documents is the government's role in upholding the integrity of the electoral system. The AEC's meticulous process for verifying party membership \u2013 including matching member lists against the electoral roll (Documents 9, 14, 25), contacting a random sample of members for confirmation (Documents 20, 21, 22), and applying a strict threshold for permissible denials (Document 24) \u2013 demonstrates a commitment to fair and legitimate political processes. The refusal of the \"Stop Selling Australia\" party's application (Documents 24, 25, 26) was not based on the party's political platform or ideology, but solely on its failure to meet the statutory requirement for validated membership. Specifically, out of a required sample of 26 members, the party recorded 2 denials, exceeding the single denial permitted, thus failing the test (Document 24). This adherence to a transparent and consistent rule-of-law framework aligns strongly with progressive values that demand a robust, accountable, and non-arbitrary democratic system. The AEC's clear communication with the party throughout the process (Document 5) and the subsequent release of these internal documents via FOI further underscore a commitment to government transparency.\n\n**Social Justice and Accessibility of Political Participation:**\nWhile the AEC's process is vital for preventing fraudulent registrations, a progressive lens might raise questions about the practical implications for nascent or grassroots political movements. The strict numerical threshold for membership (500 members on the roll) and the low tolerance for sampling errors (only one denial permitted in a sample of 26) can present a significant barrier to entry for smaller, less resourced parties. While the \"Stop Selling Australia\" party reportedly had 503 valid members after initial checks (Document 24), the failure occurred during the random sampling validation. This strictness, while ensuring integrity, could be seen as inadvertently favoring established parties with larger, more stable memberships and administrative capacity, potentially stifling the emergence of new voices or movements that may represent marginalized perspectives or challenge the political status quo. A progressive approach might advocate for balancing democratic integrity with accessibility, exploring whether alternative validation methods or support mechanisms could facilitate broader political participation without compromising legitimacy.\n\n**Privacy and Data Protection:**\nThe documents also touch upon civil liberties in the context of privacy. The AEC explicitly stated it could not provide the party with a list of members who were not auto-matched to the electoral roll due to \"privacy reasons\" (Document 5). This demonstrates a governmental commitment to protecting individuals' personal data, even from the political organizations they claim to be a part of, which is a key progressive value in the digital age.\n\n**Environmental Impact, Wealth Distribution, and Corporate Influence:**\nThe documents are largely procedural and do not offer insights into issues related to environmental impact, wealth distribution, or corporate influence. The party's name, \"Stop Selling Australia,\" hints at concerns that *could* align with progressive views on national sovereignty, anti-privatization, or wealth retention, but the documents do not detail the party's platform or specific aims. Therefore, no direct alignment or deviation regarding these specific progressive values can be inferred from the provided records.", "model": "gemini-2.5-flash", "generated_at": "2025-06-22T22:05:17.731732", "source_hash": "2da7aa5dd640fa6efe9e4f4f1e1bb4a67f00e186472f901db4a3ff633bbece2b", "raw_response_path": "data/llm_responses/LS7759__overall__left_leaning__20250622T220517.json", "output_tokens": 745, "prompt_tokens": 16716, "total_tokens": 19865, "summary_length": 4084}, "short_index": {"text": "From a left-leaning perspective, the Australian Electoral Commission's (AEC) detailed process for verifying the \"Stop Selling Australia\" party's membership, including strict sampling and low denial tolerance, demonstrates a commendable commitment to democratic integrity, transparency, and data privacy.

The stringent 500-member threshold and the immediate rejection for exceeding a minimal sample error (two denials in 26 members) could disproportionately disadvantage less-resourced groups, potentially stifling the emergence of new voices and entrenching the power of established parties, thereby raising questions about balancing electoral legitimacy with broader political accessibility and social justice for diverse participation.", "model": "gemini-2.5-flash", "generated_at": "2025-06-22T22:05:24.101356", "source_hash": "2da7aa5dd640fa6efe9e4f4f1e1bb4a67f00e186472f901db4a3ff633bbece2b", "raw_response_path": "data/llm_responses/LS7759__short_index__left_leaning__20250622T220523.json", "output_tokens": 156, "prompt_tokens": 794, "total_tokens": 1396, "summary_length": 930}}, "right_leaning": {"overall": {"text": "As a right-leaning analyst, a review of these FOI documents concerning the attempted registration of the 'Stop Selling Australia' party reveals several aspects of government operation that both align with and, in some nuanced ways, challenge conservative principles.\n\n**Economic Efficiency:**\nThe Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) demonstrates a commitment to administrative efficiency through its use of automated data matching systems (RMANS) and statistical sampling methodologies (derived from ABS) for verifying party membership. This approach streamlines the process of checking a large membership list against the electoral roll, reflecting a practical application of technology to manage bureaucratic tasks. However, the need for manual checks for unmatched members (Doc 25) and multiple rounds of communication with the party to rectify list deficiencies (Doc 5) highlight areas where initial inefficiencies from the applicant's side can consume additional public resources, demonstrating that even well-designed systems can be impacted by external data quality.\n\n**Individual Liberty:**\nThe documents show the AEC upholding individual liberty through its rigorous membership verification process. By directly contacting a random sample of individuals and explicitly requesting their confirmation of membership (Docs 20, 22), the AEC ensures that individuals are not listed as party members without their explicit consent. This protects individual autonomy and prevents potentially fraudulent or unauthorized affiliations. Furthermore, the AEC's stated policy of not disclosing the names of members whose details could not be matched to the electoral roll, citing \"privacy reasons\" (Doc 5), strongly aligns with conservative values of protecting personal data and individual privacy from unnecessary government or third-party disclosure. The instance of a sampled individual denying membership upon follow-up (Doc 21) further validates the necessity of these checks in safeguarding individual rights.\n\n**National Security:**\nWhile the documents primarily detail the AEC's administrative processes, the very name of the party, 'Stop Selling Australia,' implicitly signals a focus on economic sovereignty and potentially national security concerns, likely in opposition to foreign ownership or perceived threats to national assets. From a conservative standpoint, such a platform's emphasis on national interest and control over national resources can resonate. The AEC's role here is to ensure that any group, regardless of its platform (as long as it operates within legal bounds), can participate in the democratic process if it meets the established, objective criteria. This reflects a commitment to a robust, open political marketplace where diverse views, including those focused on national security, can compete, provided they adhere to the rules.\n\n**Fiscal Responsibility:**\nThe AEC's methodical and rule-bound approach to party registration underscores fiscal responsibility. By requiring a minimum of 500 verified members on the electoral roll and applying a strict statistical test (permitting only one denial in the sample, Doc 24, 25), the AEC ensures that public funds and the integrity of the electoral system are not wasted on registering non-viable or potentially unserious political entities. The application fee (Doc 25) also contributes to offsetting administrative costs. The refusal of the 'Stop Selling Australia' party's application due to failing this core membership test (two denials against one permitted, Doc 24, 25) demonstrates a commitment to accountability and prudence in public administration, ensuring that only genuinely supported parties gain official recognition.\n\n**Limited Government:**\nThe documents provide a clear illustration of limited government in action. The AEC operates strictly within the confines of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918, meticulously adhering to statutory requirements for party registration (Doc 25, citing sections 4, 123, 126, 129, 131). The process for assessing the party's constitution, name, and membership is transparent and defined by law, not by arbitrary bureaucratic discretion. The decision to refuse the application in its current form, based on objective criteria (failure to meet membership threshold) and offering an opportunity for the party to rectify the deficiencies (s 131 notice, Doc 25, 26), exemplifies due process. This demonstrates a government acting as an impartial arbiter of rules, ensuring fair play in the democratic system without overreaching its mandate or suppressing political expression. The temporary suspension of processing due to the federal election writs (Doc 27) and subsequent recommencement (Doc 28) further highlights adherence to established legal procedures, reinforcing the principle of government operating under the rule of law.", "model": "gemini-2.5-flash", "generated_at": "2025-06-22T22:05:47.904525", "source_hash": "2da7aa5dd640fa6efe9e4f4f1e1bb4a67f00e186472f901db4a3ff633bbece2b", "raw_response_path": "data/llm_responses/LS7759__overall__right_leaning__20250622T220547.json", "output_tokens": 896, "prompt_tokens": 16716, "total_tokens": 20035, "summary_length": 4864}, "short_index": {"text": "From a right-leaning perspective, the Australian Electoral Commission's (AEC) handling of the 'Stop Selling Australia' party's registration largely exemplifies sound conservative principles.

Furthermore, the AEC robustly upholds individual liberty and privacy by rigorously verifying consent for membership and protecting personal data from disclosure, preventing unauthorized affiliations. While the party's focus on economic sovereignty aligns with national security interests, the AEC maintains its role as an impartial arbiter, ensuring all legal platforms can compete within objective criteria, fostering a robust political marketplace.

Initial automated roll checks only matched 70% of the party's members, requiring extensive manual verification that the AEC itself admitted \"impacted the expected time to process\" (Document 5, Page 4). This points to either inefficient internal systems or an excessive data quality burden placed on aspiring parties.\n\n2.  **Lack of Transparency & Obstructive Policies:** The AEC explicitly refused to provide the party with a list of members who could not be verified on the electoral roll, citing \"privacy reasons\" (Document 5, Page 2-3). This policy, while perhaps adhering to a narrow interpretation of privacy, actively undermined the party's ability to efficiently correct its membership list, forcing them to perform their own time-consuming checks without precise feedback from the official body. This places an unnecessary obstacle in the path of new political organizations.\n\n3.  **Arbitrary & Overly Rigid Application of Rules:**\n    *   Despite the AEC's own checks confirming **503 enrolled members** for the party (exceeding the 500-member minimum threshold for registration) (Document 25, Page 3), the application was ultimately refused.\n    *   The refusal stemmed from a disproportionately strict interpretation of membership sampling. While the statistical formula required a sample of 26 members with only one denial permitted, the AEC **attempted to contact 52 members**\u2014double the required sample size\u2014citing \"uncontactable\" members (Document 24, Page 3; Document 25, Page 3).\n    *   From these 52 attempts, 24 confirmations were received, but critically, **two denials** were recorded. One denial was even secured through a follow-up phone call to a previously \"neutral\" respondent (Document 21), suggesting a persistent effort to identify non-confirming members. This hyper-scrupulous approach, contacting double the required sample and pursuing a denial to reach an arbitrary limit, appears to prioritize bureaucratic adherence over facilitating legitimate political participation.\n\n4.  **Waste of Public and Private Resources:** The extensive internal reviews, multiple data submissions, manual checks, and prolonged membership verification process, culminating in a refusal based on a single additional denial in an *oversized* sample, represents a significant expenditure of taxpayer money and administrative resources. This bureaucratic overreach and a seemingly adversarial approach to a party that otherwise met the core numerical requirement constitutes questionable decision-making and a waste of both government and the party's resources.", "model": "gemini-2.5-flash", "generated_at": "2025-06-22T22:06:19.619887", "source_hash": "2da7aa5dd640fa6efe9e4f4f1e1bb4a67f00e186472f901db4a3ff633bbece2b", "raw_response_path": "data/llm_responses/LS7759__overall__government_skeptic__20250622T220619.json", "output_tokens": 616, "prompt_tokens": 16712, "total_tokens": 20270, "summary_length": 3071}, "short_index": {"text": "The FOI documents reveal how the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) employed a protracted, inefficient, and seemingly obstructive bureaucratic process to hinder the 'Stop Selling Australia' party's registration.

From the outset, the AEC demonstrated its commitment to facilitating legitimate political participation by providing clear guidance and maintaining open communication with the party. Initial interactions, as seen in the email chains (Doc 5), show the AEC actively assisting the party in submitting an accurate membership list, demonstrating a supportive approach to compliance.\n\nA cornerstone of the AEC's responsibilities is to ensure that political parties meet the statutory requirements, particularly the minimum membership threshold. The documents reveal the AEC's meticulous, multi-layered approach to membership verification:\n\n*   **Rigorous Data Matching (Docs 1, 9, 14):** The AEC efficiently employed sophisticated systems like RMANS and conducted manual checks (GENESIS) to cross-reference the party's submitted membership list against the Commonwealth Electoral Roll. This thorough process ensures that only genuinely enrolled electors are counted as members, safeguarding the electoral roll's accuracy and preventing misrepresentation.\n*   **Direct Member Verification (Docs 20, 21, 22):** Beyond data matching, the AEC undertook the essential step of contacting a random sample of members directly via email and phone. This direct contact mechanism is a critical control measure, preventing inflated or erroneous membership claims and protecting individual privacy by confirming their affiliation.\n*   **Transparent Reporting (Docs 23, 24):** The results of this rigorous testing were meticulously compiled and presented, clearly indicating that the 'Stop Selling Australia' party's membership, after verification, did not meet the necessary threshold as per the *Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918*. This is not a \"controversy,\" but rather a demonstration of the regulatory process working as intended, ensuring all parties meet the same fair, legislated standards.\n\nFollowing the comprehensive assessment, the AEC's internal minute (Doc 25) clearly outlines the rational and legal basis for the decision, confirming that while the party's constitution and name met requirements, the critical membership criteria were not satisfied. This structured decision-making process underscores the AEC's adherence to the rule of law.\n\nCrucially, the AEC's response was not an immediate refusal. Instead, the AEC issued a notice (Doc 26) under Section 131 of the *Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918*, offering the 'Stop Selling Australia' party the opportunity to rectify the identified deficiencies, specifically related to its membership. This exemplifies the government's commitment to due process and fairness, providing applicants with a chance to meet regulatory standards.\n\nFurthermore, the documents (Docs 27, 28) show how the AEC seamlessly managed the processing of the application around the 2019 federal election. By suspending and then recommencing the application process in accordance with Section 127 of the Act, the AEC demonstrated its unwavering commitment to maintaining the integrity of the election cycle while ensuring that party registration applications are handled appropriately within the statutory framework.\n\nIn summary, these FOI documents showcase the government's dedication to effective governance through the AEC's transparent, diligent, and legally compliant processes.

The *same* membership list, tested against the electoral roll a month apart, yielded *different* \"matched\" and \"no match\" numbers (406 vs 404 matched; 133 vs 135 no match). This is irrefutable evidence of either a fundamental flaw in the AEC's \"RMANS\" (Roll Management Automated National System), a shocking lack of data integrity, or unacknowledged changes in the roll-checking methodology. Furthermore, document #14 explicitly admits \"RMANS does not allow for the retention of highlighted fields,\" indicating antiquated, non-functional IT systems that actively hinder internal communication and efficient problem-solving.\n\n2.  **Intentional Obstruction and Lack of Transparency:** The AEC deliberately withheld crucial information from the party. Document #5 shows the party explicitly asked to be \"notified of which members don't meet your requirements,\" only to be flatly refused \"for privacy reasons.\" This forces the party into a blind re-verification process, putting the entire burden of rectifying errors onto them without providing actionable intelligence. This is not assistance; it is a calculated impediment, leveraging privacy as an excuse for bureaucratic inefficiency or a deliberate barrier to entry. The AEC's advice that it \"can save a party several weeks in delays if the party does its own check\" is an implicit admission that their own process is inherently slow and burdensome, pushing their responsibility onto the applicant.\n\n3.  **Flawed and Punitive Verification Methodology:**\n    *   The \"membership testing\" process was a complete failure. Document #24 states that the AEC \"attempted to contact 52 members\" (twice the required random sample of 26), yet only received 26 responses (24 confirmations, 2 denials). This means half of the people contacted by the AEC were unresponsive or uncontactable, highlighting a severe deficiency in the AEC's communication strategy or the quality of the contact information it demanded.\n    *   Document #21 lays bare the inadequacy of the email verification method. One member, initially assessed as a \"neutral contact\" via email, outright \"denied being a member\" when subsequently contacted by phone. This single instance exposes the email-based system as prone to misinterpretation and inaccurate results, potentially inflating the \"confirmations\" and leading to an artificially positive initial assessment. The fact that a phone call only happened on \"recommendation\" rather than as a standard practice for ambiguous responses further reveals a reactive, rather than robust, verification process.\n    *   The \"one denial permitted\" rule (Doc #24, #25) is an excessively stringent and arbitrary criterion for a party requiring 500 members. It sets an almost impossibly high bar, ensuring that minor discrepancies or even genuine misunderstandings by just two individuals lead to the entire application's failure, regardless of hundreds of confirmed members. This rule appears designed to exclude rather than facilitate.\n\n4.  **Excessive Delays and Bureaucratic Stalling:** The application, submitted in November 2018, dragged on for months, finally failing in March 2019. This timeline was exacerbated by multiple \"updated membership list\" submissions (Doc #5, #25), some caused by basic administrative errors (AEC's \"no membership list attached\" response in Doc #5), and others by the AEC's drawn-out, opaque verification cycles. While external factors like election writs (Doc #27, #28) contributed to some delays, the preceding four months of processing were already a testament to the AEC's glacial pace and the convoluted nature of its requirements. The final decision to \"set aside\" the application rather than offer a clear path to immediate rectification is a final bureaucratic insult, forcing the party into a virtual re-application.\n\nIn sum, the documents paint a damning picture of the AEC as an institution mired in outdated technology, plagued by internal inconsistencies, and operating with a process that appears to be deliberately designed to be an insurmountable hurdle for new political parties through a combination of administrative incompetence, lack of transparency, and overly punitive regulations.", "model": "gemini-2.5-flash", "generated_at": "2025-06-22T22:07:23.674933", "source_hash": "2da7aa5dd640fa6efe9e4f4f1e1bb4a67f00e186472f901db4a3ff633bbece2b", "raw_response_path": "data/llm_responses/LS7759__overall__highly_critical__20250622T220723.json", "output_tokens": 965, "prompt_tokens": 16713, "total_tokens": 21605, "summary_length": 4690}, "short_index": {"text": "The FOI documents paint a damning portrait of the Australian Electoral Commission as an obstructionist bureaucracy, exhibiting systemic incompetence, deliberate opaqueness, and excessively punitive standards in its processes for registering new political parties.

This \nnotice will give the Party the opportunity to vary the application so refusal of the application may \nnot be required. \n\nAuthority \nSections 4, 123, 126, 129 and 131 and subsections 4(1) and 123(1) of the Electoral Act. \n\nBackground \nOn 24 November 2018, the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) received all of the \nrequirements from the Party for an application for registration as a non-Parliamentary party \nunder paragraph 126(1)(b) of the Electoral Act (folio 52). The application included a copy of the \nParty\u2019s constitution (folio 16), an electronic list of between 500-550 members and a statutory \ndeclaration from the proposed Party secr tary regarding the authenticity of these documents \n(folio 21). The Party indicated that it did not wish to register an abbreviation or party logo  \n(folio 32).  On 23 January 2019 and 22 February 2019 the Party provided updates to its \nmembership list which impacted on  he  ime taken to assess the application.  \n\nInitial assessment of application \nIn the case of a non-Parliamen ary party paragraph 126(1)(b) of the Electoral Act provides that \nthe application may be made by 10 members of the party, of whom one is the secretary of the \nparty. The application is made by 10 members of the Party, one of which is the Party secretary, \nand sets out the names and addresses of the applicants, and particulars of the capacity in which \neach applicant makes the application (folio 30).  \n\nAssessment of constitution \nSections 4 and 123 of the Electoral Act define an eligible political party as an organisation the \nobject or activity, or one of the objects or activities, of which is the promotion of the election to \nthe Senate or to the House of Representatives of a candidate or candidates endorsed by it.  \n\nSubsection 123(1) of the Electoral Act defines an eligible political party as a political party that is \n\u201cestablished on the basis of a written constitution (however described) that sets out the aims of \nthe party\u201d. \n\nThe Party\u2019s constitution meets this requirement because: \n\nPage 1    Minute \n\nReleasd under the Freedom of Information Act 1982LS7759 Document No. 25\n\n\n--- Page 2 ---\n\n\u2022\n\nclause 3.2.16 states an objective of the Party is to \u201cendorse Party candidates for Local,\nState and Federal elections\u201d (folio 12).\n\nAssessment of proposed party name  \nName sought: Stop Selling Australia Party  \nSection 129 of the Electoral Act prohibits the registration of parties with certain names and \nabbreviations. An assessment of the proposed name was undertaken to ensure it did not \ncontravene s 129. The proposed name: \n\na) does not comprise more than six words\nb)\nc)\n\nis not obscene\nis not the name, abbreviation or acronym of the name of another political party (not\nbeing a political party that is related to the party to which the application relates) that is a\nrecognised political party\n\nd) does not so nearly resemble the name, abbreviation or acronym of the name of another\n\npolitical party (not being a political party that is related to the party to which the\napplication relates) that is a recognised political party that it is likely to be confused with\nor mistaken for that name or that abbreviation or acronym, as the case may be\n\nda) is not one that a reasonable person would think suggests a connection or relationship \nexists between the party and a registered party if that connection or relationship does \nnot in fact exist \n\ne) does not comprise the words \u2018Independent Party\u2019 or comprise or contain the word\n\n\u2018Independent\u2019 and:\n\ni.\n\nthe name, or an abbreviation or acronym of the name, of a recognised political\nparty; or\n\nii. matter that so nearly resembles the name, or an abbreviation or acronym of the\nname, of a recognised political party  hat the matter is likely to be confused with\nor mistaken for that name or that abbreviation or acronym, as the case may be.\n\nThe federal Register was checked (folios 126-128) and that of each state and territory \n(folios 103-124) for parties with a similar name or abbreviation.  \n\nThe following party names contained the word \u201cstop\u201d: \n\n\u2022 Stop Population Growth Now Party (Electoral Commission of South Australia) (folio 110).\n\nThe following party abbreviations contained the word \u201cstop\u201d: \n\n\u2022 Stop Population Growth Now (Electoral Commission of South Australia) (folio 110).\n\nThe above parties share the word \u201cstop\u201d but share no further similarities with the Party\u2019s \nproposed name. The Party\u2019s proposed name is not the same as that of a recognised political \nparty. Furthe , there is enough of a difference between the Party\u2019s name and the above name \nand abbreviation that it is not likely to be confused or mistaken, and a reasonable person would \nnot think that a connection or relationship exists between the parties.   \n\nBased on this information the Party\u2019s name is not prohibited under s 129 of the Electoral Act. \n\nAssessment of membership \nSubsection 123(1) of the Electoral Act defines an eligible political party as a political party that is \neither a Parliamentary party or has at least 500 members. Paragraph 126(2)(ca) of the Electoral \n\nPage 2    Minute \n\nReleasd under the Freedom of Information Act 1982LS7759 Document No. 25\n\n\n--- Page 3 ---\n\nAct states that an application for registration must \u201cinclude a list of the names of the 500 \nmembers of the party to be relied on for the purposes of registration\u201d.  \n\nThe membership list submitted by the Party contained 550 members. This list was checked \nautomatically using RMANS, with 404 members identified on the electoral roll. A further 117 \nmembers were manually identified on the electoral roll using GENESIS while 29 members were \nunable to be matched to the roll.  \n\nFifteen members were identified as duplicates within the list and three members were identified \nas cross party duplicates. See folio 100 for a breakdown of the membership numbers.  \n\nA list of 503 members requires contact with a random sample of 26 members under the formula \nprovided by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (folio 94). For the AEC to be satisfied that the \nParty has the required 500 members, one denial of membership is permitted.  \n\nThe relevant numbers for this membership test were: \n\n1.\n2.\n3.\n\nthe random sample size was 26\nthe AEC attempted to contact 52 members, as some members were uncontactable\nthe highest 26 responses were:\n24 confirmed membership\n-\ntwo denied membership.\n-\n\nA record of those contacted is at folio 96. Based on this information the Party\u2019s membership list \nfailed the membership testing assessment of the applica ion process. \n\nThe Party\u2019s application will be set aside until the def ciencies identified are rectified and an \nupdated membership list is either resubmitted or  he application withdrawn. This will be raised \nwith the Party in the s 131 notice  \n\nOther procedural application requirements \nThe application meets the requirements of paragraphs 126(2)(c), 126(2)(d), 126(2)(e) and \n126(2)(g) of the Electoral Act as it:  \n\u2022\n\nset out the name and address of the person who is to be the registered officer of the Party\nfor the purposes of the Electoral Act\nadvised that

the application, and\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022 was accompanied by a fee of $500.\n\nConclusion \nAn assessment of the Party\u2019s application was undertaken and it was determined that:

and\n126(2)(g) of the Electoral Act.\n\n\u2022\n\nBased on this information, the Party\u2019s application, in its current form, does not satisfy the \nrequirements of Part XI of the Electoral Act.

Of the 549 entries on the list of people provided by the Party in support of its \napplication 384 have been automatically matched to the Commonwealth Electoral Roll. Details for 167 of the entries \nof people provided by the Party in the current membership list require further manual checking by the AEC. For the \nAEC to undertake 165 manual checks on the current list will impact the expected time to process the Party\u2019s \napplication. It also indicates that some of the details for these members are deficient or erroneous as they have not \nbeen automatically matched to the Commonwealth Electoral Roll. Should the AEC not be assured that more than \n500 members are electors (currently on the Commonwealth Electoral Roll) results in a party failing the membership \ntest.  \n\nCan you please advise if you would like the AEC to continue to process the list submitted by the Party or if the Party \nwill provide an alternate membership list as part of its application. The AEC will set aside the Party\u2019s application until \nit receives an alternate membership list or is advised to continue testing the current list. \n\nThe party can use the details in the membership list to check that each member is enrolled by using the check my \nelectoral enrolment facility or eRoll which is available in all AEC offices. Party members used to support the \napplication must be listed on the Commonwealth Electoral Roll. It can save a party several weeks in delays if the \nparty does its own check of its members\u2019 electoral enrolment online or at an AEC office. \n\nRegards \n\n | Assistant Director  \n\nParliamentary and Party Registration Section | Disclosure, Assurance & Engagement Branch \nAustralian Electoral Commission \nT: \n\nFrom: \nSent: Saturday, 24 November 2018 1:58 PM \nTo: FAD <FAD@aec.gov.au> \nSubject: RE: Recommencement of processing party registration applications - s 127 Commonwealth Electoral Act \n1918 [SEC=UNCLASSIFIED] \n\nAfternoon \n\n4\n\n111113Released under the Freedom of Information Act 1982LS7759 Document No. 5171\n\n\n--- Page 5 ---\n\nPlease find the amended membership list now showing 549 members as requested. \n\nPlease let me know if you require any further information.
