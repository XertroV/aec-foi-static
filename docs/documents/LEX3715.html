<h3>3. Main Content from Released FOI Request Documents</h3>
<p>The released (edited or full) documents provide insights into various operational and financial aspects of the AEC, particularly concerning the 2022 Federal Election and preparedness for future electoral events, including a potential referendum:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Document No. 22: Referendum: Funding arrangements for referendums</strong><ul>
<li>Funding for referendums and associated YES/NO campaigns is provided via government appropriation. The October 2022-23 Budget included $75.1 million over two years for preparatory work for a First Nations Voice to Parliament Referendum, with specific allocations for AEC preparations ($50.2 million) and increasing First Nations enrolment/participation ($16.1 million). An additional $160 million is provisioned in the Contingency Reserve.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Document No. 24: Financial matters</strong><ul>
<li>Highlights ongoing challenges with the AEC's funding model, noting a $24.5 million loss in 2021-22 (compared to a $47.9 million surplus in 2020-21). The AEC's operating results can fluctuate significantly due to external factors impacting expenditure timing, posing risks for managing complex electoral events and electoral roll growth.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Document No. 25: Vendors, Procurements and Major Tenders</strong><ul>
<li>The AEC undertakes extensive preparation and planning for procurements and tenders for federal electoral events, adhering to Commonwealth Procurement Rules (CPRs). A specific "Referendum Procurement Plan" is in place for a potential 2023 referendum, tracking critical procurements and contracts.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Document No. 26: Performance Statements</strong><ul>
<li>The AEC's 2021-22 Annual Performance Statements indicate that 74% (14 of 19) of performance measures were met, 5% (1 of 19) were "on track to be met," and 21% (4 of 19) were "partly met" (e.g., voter turnout, staff training completion). No measures were rated "not met."</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Document No. 27: Travel</strong><ul>
<li>Total travel expenditure increased significantly to $5.393 million in 2021-22 (from $1.579 million in 2020-21 and $1.699 million in 2019-20), primarily due to the 2022 federal election. The AEC adheres to the Whole of Australian Government Travel Policy.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Document No. 28.2: Indigenous voter services and engagement</strong><ul>
<li>The AEC is committed to increasing First Nations electoral participation. The estimated national Indigenous enrolment rate reached 84.5% as of December 2022, a consistent increase from 74.7% in June 2017. Efforts include successful direct enrolment trials (adding ~15,500 First Nations people), targeted advertising campaigns, and the Indigenous Electoral Participation Program (partnerships, remote enrolment, culturally appropriate services). The AEC is also expanding remote polling services.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Document No. 36.2: Referendum Preparedness</strong><ul>
<li>The AEC, as an independent statutory authority, is responsible solely for the "machinery" of a referendum (not the campaigns). With appropriate lead time and funding, the AEC is ready to conduct a referendum, with costs estimated to be similar to a federal election (e.g., the 2022 federal election was budgeted at approximately $420 million).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Document No. 37.2: COVID safety measures – 2022 FE</strong><ul>
<li>The AEC safely delivered the 2022 federal election with COVID-19 safety measures in place, adapting to the changing environment without a reported spike in cases attributable to the election. Planning adhered to existing legislation (which does not allow for 100% postal or electronic voting), with additional staff, vaccination requirements, and mask mandates for election workers.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Document No. 38: Early Voting</strong><ul>
<li>Early voting continues to rise, with over 7.9 million early votes cast in the 2022 federal election (51.34% of total votes), up from 6.15 million (40.79%) in 2019. In-person early voting accounted for over 36% of all votes. Postal votes significantly increased to 2.39 million (from 1.29 million in 2019). Mobile polling services were reduced due to the pandemic.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Document No. 39: Postal Voting</strong><ul>
<li>The AEC expresses confidence in the integrity of postal voting processes, which are governed by the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918. Legislative changes in 2021 modernized postal voting envelopes and allowed for the early extraction of ballot papers from declaration envelopes (from the Monday prior to election day) to speed up counting. In 2022, the AEC issued 2.73 million postal votes (an 87% return rate), with 79.2% of rejected postal votes due to missing elector or witness signatures.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Document No. 40: Mobile Polling – 2022 Federal Election</strong><ul>
<li>Mobile polling services were provided to remote areas, homeless shelters, a limited number of residential aged care facilities (RACFs), and some prisons. The decision to limit services to RACFs was based on health advice and risk assessments, requiring explicit agreement from facilities and adherence to strict COVID-19 safety measures.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Document No. 43.2: Overseas voting – 2022 Federal Election</strong><ul>
<li>COVID-19 and security concerns necessitated adjustments to overseas voting for the 2022 federal election. In-person voting was available at 19 overseas posts, while others relied on postal voting, supported by courier delivery to improve speed and reliability, and diplomatic mail for returns.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Document No. 44.2: Senate counting and assurance</strong><ul>
<li>The AEC uses ballot paper scanning to capture Senate preferences for timely scrutiny. In the 2022 federal election, over 108 million preferences from more than 15.5 million ballot papers were scanned, data-entered, and verified in approximately four weeks. The process involves human verification, robust controls, and security assessments (including IRAP). An external company performs legislated on-site assurance (0.45% exception rate in 2022). Scrutineers can observe the process. The AEC confirmed it has not used Scytl software for any federal election.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Document No. 45: EasyCount – Senate</strong><ul>
<li>"EasyCount – Senate" (ECS) is the AEC's software for distributing preferences in Senate elections. It is rigorously tested, secure, and enables reporting and auditing of results. New legislation will require an external assessor to verify ECS accuracy before the next federal election. The source code is not publicly released due to its commercial use for other elections.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Document No. 46: Polling Place Technology – ECLs</strong><ul>
<li>Investment in polling place technology will increase the number of Electronic Certified Lists (ECLs) from 5,500 (used in 2022) to 10,000 for the next federal election. A new digital tool for polling place Officers in Charge is also being developed to enhance polling place management, integrate with the AEC Command Centre, and improve issue resolution, replacing current paper-based returns.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Document No. 47: Voter verification</strong><ul>
<li>The AEC states that voter verification (requiring identification when casting a vote) is a matter for Parliament and would necessitate legislative change. The AEC warns of potential operational impacts, including increased queue times, higher costs for technology, materials, training, and staff, more time-consuming declaration votes, and the risk of disenfranchising eligible voters.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Document No. 48: Candidate qualification checklist</strong><ul>
<li>The AEC is required to check that mandatory questions on the self-assessment qualification checklist are answered by candidates but does not determine the accuracy of the answers or candidates' eligibility, as this is a matter for the High Court. For the 2022 federal election, 1,624 checklists (totalling 17,117 pages) were published soon after nominations were declared.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Document No. 49: Commonwealth Procurement Rules – Environmental sustainability</strong><ul>
<li>The AEC procures goods and services in line with Commonwealth Procurement Rules, which now explicitly require considering climate change impacts in value-for-money assessments. The AEC's practices include evaluating suppliers' environmental credentials, using recycled content, and recycling/donating end-of-life products. The document notes the challenge of measuring specific climate impacts for small items and balancing this with operational demands.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Document No. 50: Cowper Count – 2022 Federal Election</strong><ul>
<li>An administrative error occurred in the Cowper counting centre during the 2022 federal election, where some House of Representatives ballot papers were inadvertently combined across different pre-poll voting centre counts. The AEC confirmed this error did not impact the overall election results for the division and that all ballot papers were accounted for.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Document No. 51: Call Centre worker recordings</strong><ul>
<li>Addresses social media allegations that AEC call centre staff provided false voting information during the election. The AEC stated it could not verify the authenticity of such isolated claims without reviewing hundreds of thousands of enquiries and asserted that its 105,000 temporary staff are trained and provided with accurate scripts.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Document No. 61: Referendums: YES/NO pamphlet and information campaigns</strong><ul>
<li>No substantive content was provided in the released pages for this document.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Document No. 62: Election time public information campaign</strong><ul>
<li>The AEC conducted a large-scale, multi-channel communication campaign for the 2022 federal election (with a $19 million media placement spend). The campaign aimed to inform and encourage voter participation, covering enrolment deadlines, early voting options, and how to correctly complete ballot papers. It also included "Stop and Consider" messaging against disinformation and information on COVID-19 safety measures, with content translated into 52 languages.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Document No. 68: Gilmore Count</strong><ul>
<li>The AEC denied requests for a recount in the division of Gilmore following the 2022 federal election, made by the Liberal Party candidate. The Divisional Returning Officer and the Electoral Commissioner concluded that the scrutiny process was properly conducted and the margin of 373 votes did not warrant a recount, consistent with AEC policy (automatic recounts occur for margins less than 100 votes). No request was made to the Court of Disputed Returns.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Document No. 69: 2GB Discarded ballot papers found – Port Macquarie</strong><ul>
<li>The AEC is investigating reports of discarded completed ballot papers found in a bin in Port Macquarie. Initial findings suggest these were likely declaration ballot papers that were not returned correctly by voters. The small number of papers indicates no impact on the election result, and no evidence points to an operational issue by the AEC.</li>

      <p>As a politically left-leaning analyst, the provided FOI documents from the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) offer a mixed picture regarding alignment with progressive values, particularly concerning transparency, social justice, and the integrity of democratic processes.</p>
<p><strong>Key Issues and Progressive Alignment/Deviation:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Transparency and Civil Liberties (Freedom of Information):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Deviation:</strong> A pervasive and significant concern is the extensive refusal of access or heavy redaction of numerous documents critical to public oversight. Documents concerning the "Australian Electoral Commission Budget," "Cost of the 2022 Federal Election," "First Nations Electoral Enrolment and engagement," "Referendum Preparedness," "COVID safety measures for electoral events," "Foreign interference and electoral integrity," "Electoral integrity and security," "Misinformation and disinformation at the 2022 federal election," "Physical security," "Response to recent data breaches," and "YES/NO pamphlet and information campaigns" were largely withheld or provided in edited form. This lack of transparency severely limits the public's ability to scrutinize the functioning and integrity of a fundamental democratic institution, which is a direct contradiction of civil liberties and open government principles.</li>
<li><strong>Deviation:</strong> Specifically, the refusal to make the source code for "EasyCount – Senate," the software used for Senate preference distribution, public is a significant transparency issue. While the AEC cites commercial reasons, a progressive stance advocates for open-source and verifiable election technology to prevent manipulation and build public trust in the electoral process.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Social Justice &amp; Civil Liberties (Voter Access and Participation):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Alignment:</strong> The documents reveal a strong commitment by the AEC to enhancing <strong>First Nations electoral participation</strong>. Significant funding (including $16.1 million specifically for First Nations enrolment and participation) has been allocated for preparatory work for the First Nations Voice to Parliament Referendum. The AEC actively works to address historically lower participation rates in remote communities, providing resources in First Nations languages, establishing community partnerships, employing Indigenous staff, and expanding remote polling services. The consistent increase in estimated Indigenous enrolment rates (from 74.7% in 2017 to 84.5% in December 2022) is a clear success story aligning with progressive values of equity and inclusion.</li>
<li><strong>Alignment:</strong> The AEC's current policy and documented position <strong>against mandatory voter identification at polling places</strong> (Document 47) strongly aligns with progressive values. The AEC highlights that introducing such measures would increase queue times, costs, and disproportionately risk disenfranchising "groups of eligible voters" – a direct acknowledgment of the regressive impact of voter ID laws, which often target marginalized communities, students, and low-income individuals.</li>
<li><strong>Mixed:</strong> Efforts to ensure accessibility through early voting, postal voting, and mobile polling for vulnerable groups (homeless shelters, prisons, aged care facilities) are positive. However, the <em>reduced</em> mobile polling and overseas in-person voting due to the pandemic (Document 38, 40, 43.2), while understandable in context, represents a temporary setback for universal accessibility. The high rate of rejected postal votes (140,124 in 2022, 79.2% due to missing signatures, Document 39) also highlights ongoing challenges in voter education or accessible completion methods that disproportionately impact certain demographics.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Environmental Impact:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Alignment:</strong> The explicit amendment to the Commonwealth Procurement Rules (effective July 2022) requiring the inclusion of "climate change impacts" in "value for money assessment" for procurements (Document 49) is a direct alignment with progressive environmental values, integrating sustainability into government operations.</li>
<li><strong>Mixed:</strong> While the policy is a positive step, the AEC acknowledges the practical difficulties in implementing and measuring these impacts at a granular level, indicating that the policy's full transformative effect is still evolving.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Wealth Distribution &amp; Corporate Influence:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Mixed/Deviation (Potential):</strong> The documents reveal "ongoing challenges with the AEC’s funding model" (Document 24), leading to operating losses and posing "significant risk" to managing complex electoral events. Underfunding of a critical public service can lead to increased reliance on private contractors and outsourcing, potentially diverting public funds to private profits (Document 25, 39). While the documents state adherence to procurement rules, the lack of detailed transparency on specific contracts due to redactions and refusals makes it difficult to assess the extent of corporate influence.</li>
<li><strong>Deviation (Potential):</strong> Concerns are raised regarding political parties making "significant changes to the approved PVA artwork" for postal vote applications and "late engagement" from major parties on online applications (Document 39). These issues, even if addressed by the AEC, highlight potential for external political influence or inefficiencies within what should be a neutral, publicly administered process.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In summary, while the AEC demonstrates commendable dedication to social justice through its proactive Indigenous engagement and its stance against voter ID laws, the significant lack of transparency regarding its budget, operations, security measures, and the use of proprietary software presents a notable deviation from core progressive values of open government and public accountability. The commitment to environmental sustainability in procurement is a positive policy alignment, but its practical implementation is still developing.</p>

      <p>The Freedom of Information (FOI) documents requested by Cory Harding reveal concerning aspects of the Australian Electoral Commission's (AEC) operations, particularly when viewed through the lens of conservative principles such as economic efficiency, individual liberty, national security (electoral integrity), fiscal responsibility, and limited government. A predominant theme throughout the documents is a significant lack of transparency, with numerous requests for access to key financial and operational data being refused or heavily redacted.</p>
<p><strong>Fiscal Responsibility and Economic Efficiency:</strong><br />
The documents raise serious questions about the AEC's financial management and the efficient allocation of taxpayer funds. Document 24 reveals the AEC reported a <strong>$24.5 million loss</strong> in 2021-22 and faces "ongoing challenges" and "significant risk" with its funding model, indicating a lack of fiscal discipline and potential operational unsustainability.</p>
<p>Significant expenditure is highlighted, such as <strong>$75.1 million</strong> over two years for preparatory work on the First Nations Voice to Parliament Referendum (Doc 22), with $50.2 million directly to the AEC for preparations and an <em>additional</em> $16.1 million specifically for "First Nations enrolment and participation." This pre-emptive and targeted spending for a single event, alongside <strong>$160 million</strong> already in the Contingency Reserve, suggests potential overspending and a lack of restraint in discretionary government expenditure.</p>
<p>Travel expenses (Doc 27) jumped from <strong>$1.5-1.6 million</strong> in non-election years to <strong>$5.393 million</strong> in 2021-22, and while some increase is expected, the justification includes "networking with international partners and supporting reform agendas in other countries," which may be seen as mission creep beyond core electoral functions and potentially inefficient use of funds. The <strong>$19 million</strong> spent on the 2022 federal election public information campaign (Doc 62), including "Stop and Consider (disinformation) messaging," also warrants scrutiny for its scale and scope, particularly given its <strong>exemption from standard government advertising review processes</strong>, which undermines accountability.</p>
<p>The documents also reveal the considerable cost of extensive COVID-19 safety measures, with an acknowledgment of "spent costs" if restrictions eased (Doc 37.2), raising concerns about proportionality and adaptability in spending during a dynamic environment.</p>
<p><strong>Individual Liberty:</strong><br />
The AEC's stance on <strong>voter verification (ID)</strong> is a notable deviation from a common conservative tenet (Doc 47). The AEC explicitly states that voter ID "is not required" by law and warns it would lead to "increased costs," "longer queue times," and potentially "impact voter enfranchisement." This position prioritizes administrative ease over perceived security and integrity, which for conservatives, is a crucial element of safeguarding the individual's vote. The AEC's argument that voter ID "does not eliminate the possibility of administrative errors" is a weak justification against a measure widely seen as enhancing electoral integrity.</p>
<p>Conversely, the significant increase in <strong>early and postal voting</strong> (Doc 38), now comprising over 50% of votes, while presented as ensuring "fair and equitable access," can be viewed as potentially diluting the traditional civic act of voting on a single election day, and its higher administrative cost (Doc 39) impacts efficiency. The AEC's targeted "investments in partnerships and activities" and "targeted advertising campaigns" for "First Nations enrolment and participation" (Doc 28.2), while aiming to increase participation, could be interpreted as government intervention designed to influence specific demographics, potentially overstepping the bounds of merely facilitating access for all.</p>
<p><strong>National Security (Electoral Integrity):</strong><br />
The documents reveal several areas of concern regarding the integrity of the electoral process, which is fundamental to national security. The <strong>heavy reliance on postal voting</strong> (Doc 39), which saw 2.7 million issued in 2022, comes with acknowledged "resource intensive" counting processes and vulnerabilities. The fact that political parties provided 61% of paper postal vote applications, some with "significant changes to the approved PVA artwork" or "incorrect return address[es]," raises red flags about external influence and potential for error. The rejection of <strong>176,880 postal votes</strong> (79.2% for lacking elector or witness signatures) indicates substantial issues in the process or voter compliance.</p>
<p>Administrative errors were also noted, such as the combining of ballot papers across different pre-poll counts in Cowper (Doc 50), which, while claimed to have "no impact on the results," erodes public trust. The <strong>denial of a recount request in Gilmore</strong> despite a close margin (373 votes) and candidate concerns (Doc 68) can also fuel skepticism about the thoroughness of the counting process. The discovery of "discarded ballot papers" in Port Macquarie (Doc 69), even if initially attributed to voter error, highlights a lapse in ballot paper security and adds to integrity concerns.</p>
<p>The AEC's limited role in verifying <strong>candidate qualifications</strong> (Doc 48), treating the checklist as a "self-assessment tool" and deferring eligibility to the High Court, creates an "honour system" that can lead to costly post-election legal challenges and undermines the integrity of elected officials from the outset. Furthermore, allegations of <strong>call centre staff providing false voting information</strong> (Doc 51), while unverified by the AEC due to data limitations, underscore a critical integrity weakness in information dissemination.</p>
<p>The significant investment in <strong>polling place technology (ECLs)</strong> (Doc 46), costing $24.4 million, is aimed at preventing multiple voting, which aligns with integrity, but the cost-benefit of such technological solutions needs careful scrutiny. Similarly, the use of <strong>scanning and software (EasyCount – Senate)</strong> for Senate counting (Docs 44.2, 45), while efficient, relies on non-public source code for "commercial capacity" reasons, limiting full public scrutiny and potentially raising concerns about the transparency of the counting process itself.</p>
<p><strong>Limited Government:</strong><br />
A core conservative principle is limited government intervention and high transparency. The overwhelming number of <strong>refused or heavily redacted documents</strong> in the initial FOI request (pages 1-10 of the FOI schedule), covering financial matters, procurements, and integrity, is a significant blow to transparency and accountability. This lack of openness impedes public oversight of government operations.</p>
<p>The AEC's involvement in a <strong>"Stop and Consider (disinformation) messaging" campaign</strong> (Doc 62) raises concerns about government overreach into influencing public discourse and potentially infringing on free speech, rather than strictly administering elections. The exemption of this campaign from standard government advertising review processes further exacerbates concerns about the lack of independent oversight. The explicit inclusion of "climate change impacts" into "value for money" assessments for procurements (Doc 49) signals an expansion of government policy into areas beyond its core electoral function, potentially leading to less efficient, politically driven spending rather than purely economic decisions.</p>
<p>In conclusion, these FOI documents, particularly through their extensive redactions and the details they do reveal, present a picture of an electoral commission grappling with significant financial challenges, making substantial and sometimes questionable expenditures, while exhibiting a concerning lack of transparency and a cautious stance on measures that could bolster electoral integrity like voter ID. This collectively points to deviations from core conservative principles of fiscal responsibility, economic efficiency, robust electoral integrity, and limited, transparent government.</p>

    <div class="ai-summary-markdown-content">
      <p>The released FOI documents paint a concerning picture of the Australian Electoral Commission's (AEC) operations, characterised by a striking lack of transparency, questionable financial management, and potential integrity failings.</p>
<p><strong>Pervasive Secrecy and Information Withholding:</strong><br />
The overwhelming majority of requested documents – 35 out of 36 – were either completely refused or heavily redacted. This includes critical information regarding the AEC's overall budget, the true cost of the 2022 federal election, details on procurement and major tenders, travel expenses, referendum preparedness, COVID safety measures, secure telephone voting, and crucial aspects of electoral integrity, security, foreign interference, misinformation, and data breaches. This widespread withholding of information immediately suggests an agency intent on shielding its operations and decision-making from public scrutiny, fostering distrust rather than transparency.</p>
<p><strong>Financial Imprudence and Potential Waste:</strong><br />
The AEC's financial health appears precarious, with "ongoing challenges" to its funding model and a significant swing from a $47.9 million surplus in 2020-21 to a $24.5 million loss in 2021-22. This volatile financial position is described as posing "significant risk" to managing future electoral events. Furthermore, substantial taxpayer funds are being allocated for a potential referendum even before it is confirmed or fully costed: $66.3 million for "preparatory work" and "participation" is <em>additional</em> to a vague $160 million already parked in the "Contingency Reserve," raising concerns about pre-emptive overspending and potential waste. The admission of "some spent costs" on COVID safety measures that became unnecessary further highlights a lack of agile financial management.</p>
<p><strong>Operational Deficiencies and Reduced Voter Access:</strong><br />
The AEC's own performance statements reveal that nearly a quarter of its targets were only "partly met," including the critical "percentage of voters enrolled who turn out to vote." This points to fundamental inefficiencies in encouraging participation. There was a notable reduction in vital services for vulnerable populations during the 2022 election, with mobile polling not conducted at hospitals or independent living facilities, and overseas in-person voting severely curtailed, potentially disenfranchising segments of the electorate. The revelation that the AEC is only now investing $24.4 million to replace "paper OIC Returns" with digital tools underscores a long-standing reliance on inefficient, outdated processes.</p>
<p><strong>Grave Concerns for Electoral Integrity and Accountability:</strong><br />
Several findings directly challenge the integrity and trustworthiness of the electoral process:<br />
*   <strong>Software Secrecy:</strong> The AEC's staunch refusal to release the source code for "EasyCount – Senate," the software used for counting Senate preferences, is a glaring transparency issue. Without independent scrutiny of this critical software, the integrity of vote tabulation remains unverified and susceptible to suspicion.<br />
*   <strong>Mass Voter Disenfranchisement:</strong> A staggering 176,880 postal votes were rejected in the 2022 election, with 79.2% of these rejections due to technicalities like missing elector or witness signatures. This represents a significant number of legitimate votes discarded due to procedural hurdles, undermining the democratic right to vote.<br />
*   <strong>Political Party Influence and Inefficiency:</strong> The heavy reliance on political parties to distribute postal vote applications (61% of paper applications came from parties) led to critical issues. Parties made "significant changes to the approved PVA artwork," failed to provide all artwork versions, and in some cases, delayed forwarding applications to the AEC for up to two weeks, causing "double handling and delays" and prompting "many queries and complaints" from voters. This blurs the line between party campaigning and official electoral processes, raising concerns about partisan interference and inefficiency.<br />
*   <strong>Non-Verification of Candidate Eligibility:</strong> The AEC explicitly states it "does not determine the accuracy" of information provided by candidates on their qualification checklists, merely checking if questions are answered. This effectively outsources the crucial task of verifying a candidate's eligibility to the candidates themselves, creating a clear loophole for unqualified individuals to run for office and potentially waste public resources on contested elections.<br />
*   <strong>Ballot Handling Failures:</strong> Despite the AEC's dismissive tone, the confirmed "administrative error" of mixing ballot papers across different counting centres in Cowper, and the alarming report of "completed ballot papers" being found discarded in a bin in Port Macquarie, highlight severe lapses in ballot security and chain-of-custody protocols. The AEC's attempts to deflect blame to voters or claim "no impact" are unconvincing given the seriousness of discarded votes.<br />
*   <strong>Dismissal of Allegations:</strong> Allegations of call centre staff providing "false voting information" were effectively dismissed by the AEC due to the sheer volume of calls, indicating an unwillingness or inability to properly investigate and ensure accurate information dissemination.<br />
*   <strong>Unscrutinised Advertising Spend:</strong> A $19 million public information campaign for the 2022 election operated under a "long-standing exemption from the review and approval processes of government advertising campaigns." This lack of oversight for a significant public expenditure raises questions about the campaign's true purpose and effectiveness, especially given the "partly met" turnout rate.<br />
*   <strong>Refusal of Recount:</strong> The AEC's refusal to grant a recount in the close Gilmore division (a margin of 373 votes), despite specific concerns from a candidate regarding scrutineer access and informal vote assessment, further erodes confidence in the declared results, particularly when considered alongside other ballot handling issues.</p>
<p>In conclusion, these FOI documents reveal an AEC that prioritises secrecy and procedural rigidity over full transparency and democratic access. The patterns of financial challenges, operational shortcomings, and a troubling number of incidents impacting electoral integrity, compounded by the agency's defensive responses and information suppression, demand far greater scrutiny and accountability from the government.</p>

  <div class="ai-summary-markdown collapsed">
    <div class="ai-summary-markdown-content">
      <p>The government is steadfastly committed to ensuring effective governance, upholding necessary regulations, and delivering positive outcomes for the public through its robust electoral administration. A recent Freedom of Information (FOI) request highlights the meticulous planning and transparent processes employed by the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) in fulfilling its crucial mandate.</p>
<p><strong>Robust and Transparent Electoral Operations:</strong><br />
The AEC's operations are consistently affirmed through an unmodified audit opinion, demonstrating sound financial management despite the fluctuating costs inherent in delivering major electoral events. The government proactively invests in strengthening the democratic process, as seen in the substantial allocation of funds for referendum preparedness, including significant investment in enhancing First Nations electoral participation. This commitment to inclusivity is yielding tangible results, with an encouraging and consistent increase in Indigenous enrolment rates, achieved through strategic partnerships, direct enrolment initiatives, and culturally appropriate services.</p>
<p><strong>Adapting to Challenges and Ensuring Integrity:</strong><br />
The 2022 federal election successfully navigated the complexities of the global pandemic, with the government demonstrating agile and responsible governance. Proactive legislative changes and meticulous contingency planning ensured the safe and fair delivery of the election without compromising public health, while strictly adhering to health authority advice. The rise in early and postal voting reflects the government's commitment to providing flexible and equitable access to democratic participation. Reforms in postal voting, including modernized processes and early ballot paper extraction, have significantly enhanced efficiency and voter confidence, with robust multi-layered verification processes safeguarding integrity.</p>
<p><strong>Leveraging Technology and Upholding Accountability:</strong><br />
The government is strategically investing in advanced polling place technology, such as the expanded use of Electronic Certified Lists (ECLs) and new digital tools for polling place management. This forward-thinking approach enhances efficiency, voter convenience, and electoral integrity, actively contributing to the prevention of multiple voting. The integrity of Senate vote counting is assured through rigorously tested and independently assessed software, combined with meticulous human oversight and transparent processes, with all data publicly available for scrutiny. While the AEC does not release the software's source code, its security and accuracy are independently verified, underscoring a commitment to a secure and unimpeachable electoral system.</p>
<p><strong>Ensuring Fairness and Public Trust:</strong><br />
Any minor administrative variances, such as those identified in the Cowper count, are promptly investigated and confirmed to have no impact on overall election outcomes, reinforcing public confidence. Allegations of misinformation are addressed through extensive staff training, clear guidelines, and engagement with relevant authorities, ensuring that the public receives accurate information. The transparent process for candidate qualification, requiring self-assessment and public disclosure, empowers both candidates and the electorate.</p>
<p><strong>Sustainable and Ethical Procurement:</strong><br />
The government is proactively embedding environmental sustainability into its procurement framework, with the AEC diligently applying updated Commonwealth Procurement Rules to ensure that climate change impacts are considered in value-for-money assessments. Practical efforts, such as the use of recycled materials and responsible end-of-life product management, demonstrate a dedication to sustainable operations while meeting the unique demands of electoral events.</p>
<p>The government's approach to electoral administration is characterized by continuous improvement, transparent accountability, and an unwavering dedication to serving the public interest, ensuring a robust, accessible, and secure democratic process for all Australians.</p>

    <div class="ai-summary-markdown-content">
      <p>The provided FOI documents paint a damning picture of a deeply opaque, financially mismanaged, and operationally incompetent Australian Electoral Commission (AEC), seemingly more focused on self-preservation and narrative control than transparent electoral integrity. The pervasive pattern of outright refusals and heavy redactions across almost all requested documents suggests a systematic cover-up of failures, vulnerabilities, and potentially questionable dealings.</p>
<p><strong>Systemic Opacity and Information Suppression:</strong><br />
*   <strong>Wholesale Concealment:</strong> An astonishing number of documents – 20 out of 34 listed – were either entirely refused or provided only as heavily edited copies. Crucial details regarding "Australian Electoral Commission Budget" (Doc 21) and "Cost of the 2022 Federal Election" (Doc 23) were entirely withheld, creating a black hole around the AEC's financial stewardship and the taxpayer cost of elections.<br />
*   <strong>National Security and Integrity Cover-Up:</strong> The complete refusal to release documents on "Foreign interference and electoral integrity" (Doc 63), "Electoral integrity and security" (Doc 64), "Misinformation and disinformation at the 2022 federal election" (Doc 65), and "Response to recent data breaches" (Doc 67) is an unconscionable attack on democratic transparency. It suggests either catastrophic failures in safeguarding elections against critical threats or a deliberate effort to keep the public uninformed about the true state of electoral security and vulnerabilities. The redaction codes, particularly "Proper and efficient conduct of the operations of AEC" (Code 23) and "Tests, examinations or audits material" (Code 21), are used as convenient shields to hide internal shortcomings.<br />
*   <strong>Hiding Operational Failures:</strong> Documents related to critical services like "First Nations Electoral Enrolment and engagement" (Doc 28.1), "Referendum Preparedness" (Doc 36.1), "COVID safety measures" (Doc 37.1), "Secure Telephone voting" (Doc 41), "Residential aged care facilities" (Doc 42), "Overseas voting services" (Doc 43.1), and "Senate count and assurance" (Doc 44.1) were all entirely withheld or heavily redacted. This suggests a desire to obscure significant operational weaknesses, inadequate provision of services to vulnerable voters, or failures in core electoral processes.</p>
<p><strong>Financial Instability and Questionable Spending:</strong><br />
*   <strong>Admitted Financial Precarity (Doc 24):</strong> The AEC openly admits to "ongoing challenges with the AEC’s funding model" and "significant risk in managing increasingly complex electoral events." Reporting a staggering $24.5 million loss in 2021-22, following a surplus, highlights profound financial instability and a failure in basic fiscal forecasting, jeopardizing its ability to deliver fair elections. The "unmodified audit opinion" is a low bar, indicating only accurate record-keeping, not financial efficiency or responsibility.<br />
*   <strong>Wasteful Preparatory Spending (Doc 22):</strong> The allocation of "$75.1 million over two years" for "preparatory work" and "$50.2 million" directly to the AEC for a referendum that was not yet certain reveals a willingness to commit substantial public funds to speculative projects, potentially leading to significant wasted expenditure if the referendum does not proceed.<br />
*   <strong>Excessive Travel Costs (Doc 27):</strong> A 240% increase in travel expenses in an election year ($5.393M in 2021-22) compared to non-election years ($1.5-1.7M) suggests a severe lack of cost control and potentially lavish or unnecessary travel.</p>
<p><strong>Operational Incompetence and Disenfranchisement:</strong><br />
*   <strong>Failure in Indigenous Enrolment (Doc 28.2):</strong> Despite self-congratulatory rhetoric of "increasing over time" and "considerable work," a stark 10%+ gap persists between general and Indigenous enrolment rates, leaving nearly 87,000 First Nations people unenrolled. This persistent disparity highlights a systemic failure to achieve equitable electoral participation for Indigenous Australians, with vague claims of "more resources" and "partnerships" failing to mask the ongoing issue.<br />
*   <strong>Postal Voting Fiasco (Doc 39):</strong> The AEC's "absolute confidence" in postal voting integrity is shattered by its own data: a staggering 176,880 postal votes were <em>rejected</em> in 2022, primarily due to missing signatures. This represents a colossal failure in voter education, form design, or process clarity, leading to widespread disenfranchisement. The admission of "late engagement" and altered artwork by major political parties, and voters' complaints about ballots sent to parties rather than the AEC, expose a dangerous lack of control over a critical voting pathway, opening doors for potential manipulation and voter frustration.<br />
*   <strong>Reduced Vulnerable Voter Access (Doc 40, 43.2):</strong> The "limited number" of residential aged care facilities offered mobile polling and the complete exclusion of hospitals and independent living facilities from these services represent a significant, indefensible reduction in access for vulnerable populations during a pandemic. Similarly, the reduced "overseas voting services" (only 19 in-person posts) is an admitted downgrade from 2019, forcing citizens into less reliable voting methods and undermining the principle of universal access.<br />
*   <strong>Questionable Senate Count Accuracy (Doc 44.2, 45):</strong> The claimed 0.45% "exception rate" in Senate preference capture, when applied to 108 million preferences, translates to <em>486,000</em> potential errors – a staggering figure that casts severe doubt on the "robust controls and validations" and the overall accuracy of the count. The AEC's continued refusal to release the source code for its "EasyCount – Senate" software is a fundamental breach of transparency, preventing independent scrutiny and fostering public distrust in the integrity of election outcomes. The cryptic disclosure of purchasing software from controversial vendor Scytl, only to claim it was "not used," is highly suspicious and raises questions about procurement waste or undisclosed issues.<br />
*   <strong>Slow Technology Adoption (Doc 46):</strong> A $24.4 million investment over four years to increase Electronic Certified Lists (ECLs) to only 10,000 by the <em>next</em> federal election, with a new digital tool for Officers in Charge limited to only 1,300 locations, demonstrates an incredibly slow and inefficient pace of modernization. This perpetuates reliance on outdated paper systems and implies that the AEC has been slow to address known vulnerabilities like multiple voting.<br />
*   <strong>Voter Verification Apathy (Doc 47):</strong> The AEC's passive, almost obstructionist stance on voter identification – deflecting responsibility to Parliament and highlighting only the "impacts" (increased costs, longer queues) while downplaying the benefits – signals a lack of commitment to bolstering public confidence in electoral integrity against issues like multiple voting.<br />
*   <strong>Candidate Eligibility Farce (Doc 48):</strong> The AEC explicitly abdicates responsibility for verifying candidate eligibility, treating the "qualification checklist" as a mere "self-assessment tool." This critical loophole places the burden on candidates and the High Court, undermining preventative measures for electoral integrity. The inability to provide a timeframe for publishing these "17,117 pages" due to "rigorous quality assurance" is an absurd admission of administrative incompetence, compounded by the eventual removal of these documents from public access, hindering accountability.<br />
*   <strong>Environmental Hypocrisy (Doc 49):</strong> The AEC's passive and resistant response to new environmental procurement rules, complaining about the "difficulty to identify the specific impact that supplying pencils" has on climate change, highlights a profound lack of commitment to environmental responsibility and a bureaucratic aversion to adapting to modern governance standards.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong><br />
The FOI response reveals an AEC that operates behind a veil of secrecy, selectively disclosing information while using vague justifications and bureaucratic platitudes to deflect from significant systemic issues. The extensive redactions, financial opacity, operational shortcomings leading to disenfranchisement, and a defensive stance against transparency measures combine to present an agency struggling with its core mandate, eroding public trust in Australia's electoral processes. This is not an agency inspiring confidence, but one seemingly in urgent need of radical reform and far greater independent oversight.</p>

Referendum: Funding arrangements for referendums 

Commissioner’s summary 

Issue 
Position 

Points 

Funding arrangements for the delivery of referendums and YES/NO campaigns. 
The funding for the conduct of referendums and YES/NO campaigns would be 
provided via an appropriation from a government decision as part of the Budget 
process 
The funding would form part of the Annual Appropriation Bills. 

Key facts and figures 

•

•

•

As part of the October 2022-23 Budget, the Government provided various agencies
$75.1 million over two years from 2022–23 as part of the Delivery of a First Nations Voice to
Parliament Referendum – preparatory work measure to prepare for the delivery of a
referendum to enshrine a First Nations Voice to Parliament in the Constitution.

The AEC component of the measure funding is reflected in the Appropriation Bill 1 2022-23,
and includes:

o $50.2 million in 2022–23 to the Australian Electoral Commission to commence

preparations and support work to deliver the referendum.

o $16.1 million over two years from 2022–23 to the Australian Electoral Commission
to increase First Nations enrolment and participation in future electoral events

This measure is additional to $160.0 million in funding already provisioned in the
Contingency Reserve.

FINANCIAL MATTERS 

Commissioner’s summary 

Issue 

The AEC’s financial position and funding model. 

Position 

There are ongoing challenges with the AEC’s funding model. 

Points 

• The Australian National Audit Office has issued an unmodified audit opinion

for the AEC’s 2021–22 financial statements.

• For 2021-22, the AEC reported a loss on continuing operations of

$24.5 million compared to an operating surplus of $47.9 million in 2020-21.

• The AEC’s range of electoral activities is subject to external factors which

•

can impact the timing of our expenditure. Consequently, our operating result
can fluctuate significantly from year to year.
The AEC’s current funding model continues to present an ongoing challenge
and poses significant risk in managing increasingly complex electoral events
and the ongoing growth of the electoral roll.

VENDORS, PROCUREMENTS AND MAJOR TENDERS 

Commissioner’s summary 

Issue 

Position 

Status and timing of major AEC procurements and tenders published on 
AusTender over the 2022–23 financial year. 

The AEC has undertaken extensive preparation and planning to have relevant 
procurement processes and contracts in place for the next federal election or 
referendum event.  

The AEC engages a number of suppliers to deliver some key supporting elements 
that assist in the AEC’s delivery of federal electoral events. AEC procurement 
information is published on AusTender. 

Points 

• The AEC engages a number of suppliers in support of delivering federal

election events including a referendum.

• Procurements are undertaken in accordance with the AEC Procurement
guidelines and policies including the Commonwealth Procurement Rules
(CPRs).

• The AEC uses various procurement methods to approach the market and

engage suppliers, to ensure value for money is achieved.

• The AEC continues to manage procurements and potential risks associated
with the COVID-19 environment, sustainability in procurement, and political
neutrality.

Talking points 

Question: If a referendum goes ahead in 2023, will the AEC have relevant contracts in place? 

• Yes, planning for a referendum event in 2023 is well underway.  We have a Referendum
Procurement Plan, based on the Referendum Road Ready Roadmap, tracking all critical
referendum procurements and contracts.

PERFORMANCE STATEMENTS 

Commissioner’s summary 

Issue 

2021-22 Annual Performance Statements. 

Position 

Points 

The 2021-22 Annual Performance Statements show the AEC met the majority of 
performance targets. There is room for improvement on a minority of measures.  

The AEC&#39;s performance is measured against the key activities as specified in the 
Corporate Plan 2021-22 and the performance criteria in the Portfolio Budget 
Statements.  

•

•

•

14 of 19 (74%) performance measures rated &#39;met&#39;

1 of 19 (5%) performance measure rated &#39;on track to be met&#39;

4 of 19 (21%) performance measures rated &#39;partly met&#39;

• No performance measures rated &#39;not met&#39;.

Further details of performance measures that are ‘on track to be met’ and ‘partly 
met’ can be found in the Annual Report 2021-22.  

Talking points 

Question: In the AEC’s 2021-22 Annual Report under the ‘Performance Report’ Chapter, the AEC 
has assessed itself as ‘partly met’ against the performance measure relating to: ‘Percentage of 
voters enrolled who turn out to vote at all federal electoral events (turnout rate)&#39; Could you explain 
this? 

• The AEC will undertake further analysis to determine the causes of the slightly lower

turnout, with the COVID-19 environment and the larger enrolment base likely contributing
factors.

Question: In the AEC’s 2021-22 Annual Report under the ‘Performance Report’ Chapter, the AEC 
has assessed itself as ‘partly met’ against the performance measure relating to: ‘Percentage of 
identified APS and TEW staff that undertake specific training relevant to their role&#39; Could you 
explain this? 

• The AEC adopts a blended learning approach in the training and development programs it
delivers to build the professional and operational capability of its workforce. The diverse
range of formal and informal learning activities staff engage with mean that data is more
difficult to produce as evidence performance is met. Examples of formal and informal
learning activities include: online training, demonstrations, walk-throughs and simulations,
rehearsals, virtual classrooms.
Learning completion rates for the TEW will be reported in the 2022 Electoral Pocketbook.

TRAVEL 

Commissioner’s summary 

Issue 

Cost of travel. 

Position 

The AEC has offices across the country. There are ongoing requirements for our 
staff to travel within the network for activities such as election preparation and 
delivery. 

Points 

• Total travel expenditure:

o 2021-22: $5.393 million
o 2020-21: $1.579 million
o 2019-20: $1.699 million
o 2018-19: $6.535 million

•

2021-22 travel expenses increased compared to 2020-21 and 2019-20 due to
the 2022 federal election.

• Total travel expenditure includes all costs associated with domestic and

overseas travel – travel allowance, airfares, accommodation, vehicle hire, taxis
etc.

• Overseas travel is undertaken for a variety of reasons including networking

with international partners and supporting reform agendas in other countries,
particularly developing democracies. Support to other countries is funded by
Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.

Talking points 

Question: Does the AEC adhere to the Whole of Australian Government Travel Policy? 

• Yes, including selection of the lowest practical fare unless a valid reason is identified,

documented and approved as part of the travel process.

• There are limited reasons for not selecting the Lowest Practical Fare, including:

o the most direct or shortest route to minimise traveller’s inconvenience;
o health and safety issues for officers requiring certain facilities;
o ability to ensure connections for further flights are met; and
o impact on personal responsibilities such as family (e.g. where flights would otherwise

be outside normal business hours).

KEY ISSUE SUMMARIES 

Overview – Key talking points 

• The AEC is committed to the full electoral participation of all eligible Australians and is investing

in partnerships and activities that promote the full electoral participation of First Nations
Australians.

• The AEC recognises that for First Nations Australians living in remote communities, electoral

participation rates have been historically lower than for those in more populated areas.

• The AEC notes that this is a complex area and there is more work to be done, and the AEC

remains committed to this important work.

• Compared to previous elections, for the 2022 federal election there were:

- more First Nations people represented on the electoral roll

- more resources available on voting and elections in First Nations languages than before

- more partnerships established with organisations that are trusted by First Nations

communities

- more Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people employed as Temporary Election

Workforce staff.

• Indigenous enrolment rate estimates have been published by the AEC since June 2017. The

December 2022 estimate is a national Indigenous enrolment rate of 84.5 per cent.

• The Indigenous enrolment rate has grown consistently from 74.7 per cent in 2017 to

84.5 per cent in December 2022.

• While any gap between non-Indigenous and Indigenous enrolment rates is disappointing, it is

encouraging to see that estimated Indigenous enrolment rates have been increasing over time.

• The AEC is also undertaking considerable work to improve the effectiveness of its FDEU direct

enrolment program for First Nations people.

- Three trial activities were completed in the second half of 2022 which added an estimated

15,500 First Nations people to the roll. In light of trial outcomes, changes to the
mainstream FDEU program have been adopted and we expect this to lead to further
increases in the Indigenous enrolment rate.

- One further trial activity will commence in February 2023.

• As part of the Enhancing Indigenous Electoral Participation project, the AEC ran the first
phase of a targeted enrolment advertising campaign in November/December 2022, with a
further phase planned in the first half of 2023.

• The AEC’s Indigenous Electoral Participation Program is also working to support electoral
participation of First Nations peoples through establishing partnerships, working with State and
Territory agencies to undertake remote enrolment work, and delivering targeted and culturally
appropriate services and information.

• The AEC is currently expanding and enhancing its remote polling services to offer an improved

level of service in more locations.

Indigenous enrolment estimates 

Commissioner’s summary 

Issue 

Position 

Points 

Despite steady increases, there is still a gap between the national enrolment rates 
and the estimated Indigenous enrolment rate. 
While any gap between non-Indigenous and Indigenous enrolment rates is 
disappointing, it is encouraging to see that estimated enrolment rates for First 
Nations Australians are increasing over time. 
Headlines 

• Updated AEC estimates show that an additional 21,000 Indigenous Australians

have enrolled to vote between the end of June 2022 to the end December 2022,
bringing the national estimated Indigenous enrolment rate up to 84.5% (up
2.8%).

• The rapid rise easily represents the largest increase since estimates were first

calculated in this manner by the AEC in 2017.

• We continue to work really hard in getting as many people to enrol as possible,
with a particular focus on young Australians and Indigenous Australians who
aren’t enrolled at as high a rate as others.

• The AEC’s recent direct enrolment trials are proving successful. Remote

engagement work through AEC staff and 80+ community partners is having an
impact and recent Indigenous enrolment communication campaigns are helping
to achieve the continued enrolment rise as well.

• The estimated number of ‘unenrolled’ Indigenous Australians has gone under

100,000 for the first time – to just under 87,000 – and that is significant.

Stats 

• As at 31 December 2022, the estimated Indigenous enrolment rate is 84.5 per

cent.

• This is the highest level of estimated Indigenous enrolment ever achieved,

however there is more work required to achieve parity.

• The rate is increasing in every state and territory.

• Continuous growth has seen the estimated enrolment rate increase from 74.7

per cent in June 2017 to 84.5 per cent in December 2022.

• The estimated number of eligible Indigenous people not enrolled has decreased

by 30 per cent since June 2017.

• These enrolment gains have significantly outpaced the growth of the national

electoral roll.

Question: What advice has AEC provided to Government on Indigenous 
enrolment? 

• Answer: Annual rates at 30 June have been published since 2017.

REFERENDUM PREPAREDNESS 

Commissioner’s summary 

Issue 

Preparedness for a referendum in 2023. 

Position 

The AEC is an independent statutory authority and is responsible for the 
machinery of the referendum only. It has no involvement with the 
campaigns for or against the proposed changes to the Constitution. 

Timetables for the conduct of referendums are set out in legislation. 

Points 

• With appropriate lead time and funding, the AEC is ready to conduct a

referendum.

• A referendum delivered in a similar manner to a federal election will

have similar costs. The last federal election was budgeted at
approximately $420 million.

COVID SAFETY MEASURES – 2022 FE 

Commissioner’s summary 

Issue 
Position 

Points 

COVID safe measures to support the conduct of the 2022 federal election. 
In the lead up to the 2022 federal election, the AEC was responsive to the 
changing environment and was able to safely deliver a free, fair and safe event 
without a spike in COVID-19 cases due to the federal election. 
• Legislation does not allow for alternative voting models such as 100 per cent

postal voting, or use of electronic voting options. As such, planning was
undertaken on the basis of existing legislation, accounting for potential
changes in voting patterns. This included the Contingency Measures Act which
enabled the Electoral Commissioner to make limited operational modifications
by legislative instrument where an emergency declaration was in place under
a Commonwealth law and the COVID Enfranchisement Act 2022, which
expanded telephone voting to provide contingency for electors in mandatory
isolation or quarantine due to COVID-19.

• Risk: The AEC actively engaged with stakeholders and vendors to understand
the requirements to deliver an election with COVID-19 safety measures. This
included managing health risks and from a materials perspective, issues with
supplier procurement and lead times, product availability, and the resultant
cost impacts. The AEC had a dedicated response unit to actively monitor the
COVID-19 environment including the changing nature of the pandemic in each
jurisdiction and the impact on and response required for the election. We
developed contingency plans to respond to evolving conditions.

• Staff: Additional staff were engaged in polling places and counting centres to
manage voter queues, perform touch point cleaning, and undertake vote
issuing and counting to ensure physical distancing was maintained where
possible. All staff engaged for the federal election were required to be
vaccinated and wear masks.

Talking points 

Question: Was the AEC prepared to deliver an election if there was a snap lockdown announced 
during the polling period?  

• Our planning and delivery models were designed to allow the AEC to be agile and respond to a

changing environment, particularly during this time.

• The AEC actively worked through additional contingency planning to maximise the availability

of voting services for all Australians.

• The AEC worked to the advice provided by federal and local health authorities.
• The AEC had contingencies in place to deliver an election should there be additional

restrictions in place during polling in one or more locations. This included deployment of
additional Personal Protective Equipment to polling places as necessary, as well as funds set
aside for additional cleaning of premises.

No: 37.2 

Question: The vaccine rollout allowed for restrictions to be eased. Was the AEC concerned that 
taxpayers’ money would be wasted on resources that were no longer needed? 

• Advice from the Department of Health was that COVID-19 safety measures would likely need

to remain in place in some form for the foreseeable future.

• Given the AEC had been ready to deliver an election since August 2021, there were some
spent costs. If restrictions had been significantly reduced the AEC would have looked to
achieve savings where possible without jeopardising the safety of the public.

EARLY VOTING 

Commissioner’s summary 

Issue 
Position 

Points 

The rise in early voting. 
Early voting is important in ensuring fair and equitable access to voting services. 
Under the Electoral Act, Australian voters have a range of voting options, and 
more than ever before they are exercising the right to cast their ballot before 
election day. 
The Electoral Legislation Amendment (Counting, Scrutiny and Operational 
Efficiencies) Act 2021 reduced the period by which early voting can occur, with 
earliest days declared for early voting to not be earlier than 12 days before 
election day. 
•

In person early voting continues to rise. It now makes up more than 36 per
cent of all votes counted.

• Pre-poll ordinary voting was approximately 5.07 million votes, an increase of

around 18 per cent on 2019 (4.29 million votes).

• The increase between the 2016 and 2019 election was approximately 57 per

cent.

• Approximately 583,000 pre-poll declaration votes in envelopes were received,

down 10 per cent on 2019.

• Postal votes increased significantly with approximately 2.39 million returned,

compared to approximately 1.29 million at 2019.

• Due to the pandemic, and based on advice from health authorities, there was
a reduced mobile polling service for the 2022 federal election, with those
voters unable to be serviced by mobile polling voting either by postal vote, at
an early voting centre, or at a polling place on election day.

POSTAL VOTING 

Commissioner’s summary 

Issue 

The integrity and management of postal voting in Australia. 

Position 

The AEC has absolute confidence in the integrity of the postal voting processes 
used in federal elections. 

Points 

• Postal Voting is governed by Part XV of the Commonwealth Electoral Act

1918.

• The integrity of postal voting is achieved through managing which votes are

admitted to the count.

• Counting postal votes is resource intensive and takes more time than counting

•

ordinary votes.
Legislative changes passed by the Parliament in 2021 provide contingencies
and operational efficiencies to improve postal voting services and capacity.
These include:

o modernising the design of postal voting envelopes
o allowing postal envelopes to be opened from the Monday five days
before election day and the ballot papers extracted and placed in a
sealed ballot box ready for counting after polling day.

Talking points 

Question: How many postal votes were cast in 2022, how did voters apply for a postal vote and 
how many postal votes were returned? 

•

The AEC issued 2,731,088 postal votes at the 2022 federal election, an increase from 1.5
million in 2019.

• Over 56% of voters applied for a vote online, an increase from 44% in 2019.
•

31.5% completed a paper postal vote application. These applications were processed by our
partner, Computershare in all states and territories.
The remaining 12.5% were sent to general postal voters, who automatically receive ballot
papers in the mail after an election has been announced.
The AEC received 2,382,267 completed postal votes before 13 day deadline after polling day.
This represents a return rate of 87%, higher than the 2019 return rate of 84.1%.

•

•

Question: How did the AEC engage with key stakeholders to successfully deliver postal voting in 
2022? 

•

•

The AEC recognised early in the preparation for the 2022 event that both the COVID-19
pandemic and international experience would likely have a significant effect on postal voting.
We expected significantly high volumes of applications, greater scrutiny and challenges with
production and lodgement.
The AEC leveraged strong relationships with the AEC’s postal vote provider Computershare
and with Australia Post to ensure success. These partners provided their expertise to co-
design materials and processes that mitigated risks and improved voter experience.

•  This engagement was conducted at multiple levels of all three organisations and evolved into 

governance and delivery activities during the event. 

•  The AEC knew that a proportion of the expected volume of applications would be attributed to 
political party/candidate led PVA distribution. To ensure that the PVAs distributed would be 
compliant and provided direct to Computershare, the AEC published the PVA Management 
Guide on the Candidate Hub. This guide provided key information as well as QR artwork that 
could be added to materials as needed. Specific guides were also created for each 
Computershare or TIMG site, with specific opening times and access requirements. 

•  The AEC pursued legislative changes to the requirements for a Postal Vote Certificate in order 

to be able to produce the higher volumes expected.  

•  The short period between the passing of legislative changes and the announcement of the 

election did not allow for direct voter engagement. To ensure voter needs were met the AEC: 

o  Sourced an experienced, external form designer to provide specialist advice and 

ensure voter needs and behaviours were catered for in the design of new materials 
Inserted pictorial instructions on the inside of the new PVC 

o 
o  Tested materials with AEC staff and their families 
o  Produced and published a video demonstration of how to complete a postal vote 

which was viewed over 120,000 times 

o  Updated and added guidance on the AEC website 

•  The AEC is currently working on enhancing the postal vote design further to enhance the user 

experience and maximise enfranchisement. 

Question: What was the effect of legislative changes made in 2021? 

Modernised design 

The legislative change in 2021 allowed AEC the opportunity to rethink the design and function of 
the postal voting materials sent to voters. During the redesign process AEC staff considered the 
difficulties faced and complaints made by voters in previous elections, production efficiencies and 
material durability. 

To mitigate the voter concerns the AEC: 

•  Engaged an experienced form designer to provide specialist advice and ensure voter needs 

and behaviours were catered for in the design 

•  Provided every voter with a return envelope in which both their ballot paper and personal 

details were secure. 

•  Printed completion instructions with supporting images inside the certificate. 
•  Produced and published a video demonstration of how to complete a postal vote.  

o  This video was accessed via a QR code within the postal vote certificate (PVC).  
o  Captions for the video were translated and available in 19 different languages 
o  The video was viewed over 97,000 times over April and May 2022 and was also 
published on our AEC TV YouTube channel which has also been viewed over 
31,000 times. 

The AEC worked with our partners, Computershare, to design a PVC that did not have to be glued 
into an envelope. Whilst a seemingly small feature of the previous design, this change: 

•  Eliminated multiple risks including: 

o  Availability of sub-contracted services: during our preparations only one supplier in 

Australia was able to provide folding and gluing services 

o  Ballot paper security and voter privacy: the new PVC was produced only by 
Computershare and did not need to be transported to other suppliers. 

•  Significantly increased production and ensured that postal materials were dispatched to 

applicants in the shortest timeframe possible.

No: 39 

•  Provided greater control and allowed Computershare to organise additional shifts when 

necessary. 

To ensure the new materials, specifically the return envelope, were compliant with Australia Post 
requirements the AEC also ran lodgement trials. These successful trials provided assurance that 
not only did the materials meet the addressing requirements to ensure efficient sorting by Australia 
Post, but also that the ballot papers could be securely returned to the AEC without damage.  

Ballot paper extraction prior to election day 

New legislation allowing votes from declaration envelopes to be extracted from the Monday prior to 
election day enabled the AEC to process a large number of postal vote results faster after election 
day. By the Tuesday after election day, results for over 750,000 House of Representatives postal 
votes were known, in comparison to just over 200,000 at the same time for the 2019 federal 
election. 

Question: How were PVAs managed during the 2022 election? 

PVA scanning and data capture services were provided by Computershare. The co-designed 
solution provided the following improvements to PVA management: 

•  To increase use of the online option, a QR code was added to the approved PVA artwork. 
•  Where possible Computershare were provided with candidate/party PVA artwork prior to the 
announcement of the election. This allowed Computershare to pre-program their systems to 
recognise and capture completed forms without requiring manual input by AEC staff. 

•  Paper PVAs were sent directly to Computershare to reduce double handling and ensure data 

was captured from PVAs as soon as possible. 

•  PVAs were sent to Computershare via a number of methods: 

o  Candidates and parties could deliver bulk PVAs to Computershare or TIMG sites in 

each state and territory 

o  Voters could email, fax or post their completed PVA. 

Question: How many PVAs were received from political parties in the 2022 election? What were 
the challenges with these PVAs? 

Overall the AEC received 893,243 paper PVAs of which 551, 274 (61%) can be directly attributed 
to political parties. The single consequence of direct delivery of PVAs to Computershare was that, 
due to a lack of information provided on packaging or made available to couriers, Computershare 
could not accurately record the source of the remaining 39% of paper PVAs.  

In addition, the following challenges arose: 

• 

some political parties chose to make significant changes to the approved PVA artwork, 
including removing the QR code. Each significant change needed to be reviewed by the AEC 
to ensure compliance and led to a delay in production. 

• 

•  The AEC was not provided with all versions of the PVA artwork used by political parties and 
candidates. This led to PVAs distributed in particular areas with an incorrect return address. 
Whilst the address used was managed by the AEC, it was collected by a different supplier and 
led to double handling and delays in processing. 
Late engagement by both the ALP and Liberal Party with regard to their online applications did 
not provide adequate time for the AEC to conduct full risk assessments and mitigations. 
In line with the previous events, many queries and complaints were received from voters that 
had not received their postal materials despite returning a paper PVA up to 2 weeks prior to 
the complaint. Upon further enquiry it was found that the PVA in question had been returned to 
the political party and not yet received by the AEC.

Question: In light of the negative comments regarding postal ballots at elections overseas, what 
does the AEC do to ensure the integrity of postal voting in Federal Elections? 

•  Postal voting has been an integral part of Australian elections since before Federation and like 

all AEC processes is strictly governed by legislation and AEC policies and procedures. 

•  The procedures for postal voting are governed by Part XV of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 

1918 (the Electoral Act). 

•  Every postal vote returned to the AEC must be matched to an elector before it is included in 

the count. 

•  The matching process includes the following preliminary scrutiny: 

▪  Name and address match 
▪  Postal vote signed by elector 
▪  Witness requirements 
▪  Check that the elector and witness declarations are dated on or before polling day 
▪  Checks of signatures if deemed necessary 
▪ 

If the elector has already cast a declaration vote that has been counted (whether that be 
by postal, absent or provisional) the vote is not included in the count. 

•  To ensure the secrecy of the ballot, there is a specific process whereby postal votes that are to 
be included into the count have their ballot papers removed with the elector details facing 
down, and the ballot papers are then placed in a ballot box and counted separately in batches. 
Like all processes regarding the counting of ballot papers, these processes can be observed 
by scrutineers. 

• 

Question: Did the increase in postal votes slow down the count and make it longer for seats to be 
declared? 

There are a number of factors that impact the speed of the count and the AECs ability to declare 
the poll in each division. One of these factors is the requirement to wait until 13 days after election 
day to receive returned postal votes, however the 2022 event saw other factors, including the 
increase in the number of candidates and voters marking a first preference for candidates other 
than the two-candidate preferred candidates, also affect the AEC’s ability to declare. 

New legislation that allowed ballots to be extracted from PVCs from the Monday before polling day 
did assist to increase the speed of the count, as did the changes to allow the unfolding and initial 
sorting of ordinary votes taken at pre-poll voting centres from 4pm on polling day. Further 
legislative change, such as beginning these processes earlier and streamlining declaration voting 
may further allow the AEC to provide earlier indicative results in line with public expectations. 

•  While the Electoral Act requires electors to cast their postal vote before 6pm on polling day, 
the AEC is required to wait until 13 days after election day to receive returned postal votes. 
•  A seat cannot be declared until the number of potential votes yet to be counted (which until the 

13th day includes all postal votes issued) cannot change the outcome. 

•  This can mean that votes that may decide the election may not be received until almost 
2 weeks after polling day. Therefore, if there is a greater percentage of postal votes, the 
likelihood of these votes delaying declaration is higher (particularly in marginal or close seats). 

•  The AEC’s integrity process for the return of postal votes also means that there are more 

checks and balances required than counting ordinary ballot papers cast in a physical polling 
place. This too can slow down the count and is resource intensive. The AEC applies the same 
integrity processes to all returned postal votes, regardless of whether the result of a seat or the 
election is beyond doubt.

Postal voting talking points 

• When electors apply online for a postal vote application the AEC has full digital visibility of
each individual application and its status. This is the way the majority (56% in 2022) of
applications are received. When electors apply using a paper postal vote application, they can
be received by the AEC through a number of channels including through third parties such as
political parties.

•

•

•

•

Paper forms by their nature require the data to be captured from the form and the information
recorded in order for the data to be included in the AEC’s postal voting system and the postal
vote sent. Previously this was done by manual data entry. However, developments in
technology have allowed for a digital data capture solution. The AEC has used this digital
solution to capture data from paper postal vote applications for the last three federal elections.

At no stage during previous elections has the AEC had any doubt that the data from paper
applications was being captured and postal votes actioned.

Computershare Communication Services provide both the scanning of paper applications and
the printing and mailing of postal voting packs.

Comments about postal voting processes for the 2020 US elections may have meant there
was more scrutiny of the Australian process. Due to the preparation and engagement activities
undertaken by AEC, the AEC did not experience a significantly higher level of scrutiny. Whilst
some questions and accusations were raised in social media forums, the AEC was able to
quickly demonstrate the integrity of our processes and resolve problems as required

• While the AEC attempts to match all postal vote applications to an elector on the electoral roll
before dispatching the postal vote, this is not always possible. In 2022, 1.5% of the 2,731,088
postal votes issued were not matched to an elector.

•

•

The AEC works very closely with Australia Post and Computershare to ensure postal votes are
delivered before the election and to facilitate their return to the AEC.  These relationships were
critical to the successful delivery of postal voting services.

The AEC received some publicity at the 2019 federal election when it was raised in the media
that a postal vote for Mr Edward (Ned) Kelly was delivered to the Glenrowan Hotel. As the
AEC explained at the time, the legislation allows for any person to complete a PVA, however,
the processes upon return means the vote will only be counted if that name can be matched to
the address on the electoral roll.

2022 federal election postal voting statistics 

o Number of Postal Votes Issued: 2,731,088

o Number of Postal Votes Returned: 2,389,751

o Number of Postal Votes Admitted to count: 2,212,301

o Number of Postal Votes Partially Admitted*: 1,256

o Number of Postal Votes Rejected**: 176,880

▪

▪

* Partially admitted means that only the Senate Ballot Paper was counted

** 140,124 (79.2%) of postal votes rejected were due to no elector or witness signature

Recent legislative changes 

Electoral Legislation Amendment (Counting, Scrutiny and Operational Efficiencies) Act 2021 
Royal Assent 2 September 2021 

Measure 

Details 

Remove the requirement 
for paper postal vote 
applications (PVAs) to be 
sent to the home division 
Allow digital process for 
overseas voters who 
can&#39;t find an authorised 
witness 

Admitting postal vote 
ballot papers outside 
PVC envelope but within 
an outer envelope 

Allow extraction of ballot 
papers from declaration 
vote envelopes before 
polling day 

This removes the requirement to send paper PVAs in the declaration 
vote exchange. The divisions where the paper PVA is received will 
retain the paper form with other election records, to be destroyed in 
accordance with statutory authorisation.  
Under s 194(1A), an overseas voter who can&#39;t find a witness can 
attach to their postal vote a signed and dated statement and a 
photocopy of their passport. This change allows them to submit their 
statement and an image of their passport electronically. 
If a postal ballot paper is returned inside an outer envelope but 
outside the postal vote certificate (PVC) it is currently not allowed to 
be admitted to the count. This measure saves those votes. It enables 
the AEC to supply a return outer envelope with the postal voting 
pack, easing voters’ concerns about privacy. 
The opening of the envelopes, extracting of ballot papers, unfolding 
and reconciling, is shifted from just before further scrutiny, to just 
after preliminary scrutiny, if it is up to five days before polling day. 
The ballot papers will be placed in ballot boxes ready for sorting and 
counting after the close of the poll. The AEC will extract postal votes 
from the Monday before election day. 
The process where postal votes received from electors who also 
voted with a mobile team are removed will no longer be conducted. 

Electoral Legislation Amendment (Contingency Measures) Act 2021 
Royal Assent 13 December 2021 

Measure 

Details 

Postal vote certificate 
does not have to be 
printed on an envelope 

Changes and impacts: 

The AEC can process a postal vote certificate placed inside an 
envelope as if it were a postal vote certificate printed on an 
envelope. This allows the AEC to provide postal vote certificates in 
the approved form but not necessarily printed on an envelope. 

•  Postal envelopes may be opened from the Monday five days before election day and the ballot 

papers extracted and placed in a sealed ballot box ready for counting after polling day. 
•  Changes have been made to postal voting requirements, allowing the AEC to modernise the 

design of postal voting envelopes. 

•  The early extraction of postal votes and earlier sorting of pre-poll votes did provide some 

efficiencies and help the AEC cope with increasing volumes of early votes.  

•  There will be some ability to count postal votes and provide results earlier in the period after 

polling day than previously, however the AEC’s priority will remain to count ordinary votes first.

MOBILE POLLING – 2022 FEDERAL ELECTION 

Commissioner’s summary 

Issue 

Mobile polling service offering for the 2022 federal election. 

Position 

Mobile polling is an important component of election service delivery. The AEC 
provided mobile polling to remote areas, homeless shelters, a limited number of 
residential aged care facilities and some prisons.  

Points 

Residential aged care facilities 

• Based on advice from health authorities and a detailed risk assessment, the

AEC offered mobile polling services to a limited number of residential aged
care facilities at the 2022 federal election. This decision was endorsed by all
Chief Health Officers nationally in late December 2021 and required facilities
to explicitly agree to a mobile team attending the facility.

• Specific arrangements were put in place to communicate with facilities about
voting options for their residents and to provide support to facilities who did
not receive mobile polling.

Other locations (e.g. homeless shelters) 

• The AEC provided mobile polling services to homeless shelters and some

other community locations who agreed to the service.

• A mobile polling service was provided to a limited number of prisons that were
identified as having a high risk of electors being unable to vote by another
method.

Talking points 

Question: What mobile polling services were provided? 

• Based on advice from the Department of Health and a detailed risk assessment, the AEC

offered mobile polling services to a limited number of residential aged care facilities at the 2022
federal election where certain criteria were met. This decision was endorsed by all Chief Health
Officers nationally in late December 2021.

• The AEC also conducted mobile polling at locations where there was a very high risk of

disenfranchisement, such as homeless shelters and some prisons.

• Mobile polling was not conducted at hospitals or independent living facilities.

• Voters at establishments that were not offered mobile polling were able to vote by visiting an
early voting centre, visiting a polling place on election day or applying for a postal vote.

• The AEC also established dedicated support staff in each state and territory to communicate
and facilitate voting options for voters in aged care facilities and other locations where mobile
polling was not offered.

Question: How did the AEC ensure the safety of voters in residential aged care facilities? 

• Strict COVID-19 safety measures were in place for all mobile polling teams to ensure the safety
of voters, facility staff, facility visitors and AEC staff. These measures included the requirement
for the AEC’s temporary election workforce to be fully vaccinated and to comply with relevant
facility requirements.

• Chief Health Officers and individual residential aged care facilities were able to decide up until

the mobile polling service was delivered whether to permit access, depending on the COVID-19
environment. Where facilities cancelled mobile polling services, these locations were provided
with information and assistance from support cells in each state and territory office.

OVERSEAS VOTING – 2022 FEDERAL ELECTION 

Commissioner’s summary 

Issue 
Position 

Points 

Availability of voting for Australians overseas. 
COVID-19 and other international security concerns necessitated a risk 
assessment of overseas voting for the 2022 federal election. The AEC put 
additional processes in place to maximise the availability of voting services for 
Australians overseas.  
• Australians overseas were able to vote in person at 19 overseas posts.
• Australians in other locations were able to vote by postal vote.
• All Australians overseas were encouraged to apply for a postal vote in case

their in-person location became unavailable at short notice.

• The AEC delivered overseas postal votes by courier to improve delivery time

and reliability.

• Australians were able to mail their completed postal vote to Australian

missions which were collected and returned to Australia by diplomatic mail.
• Voters were kept informed through the AEC and Smartraveller websites, as

well as social media.

• The AEC is working with DFAT and Austrade to review our overseas voting for
future events with the aim of returning to the level of service provided for the
2019 federal election.

Talking points 

Question: Why couldn’t all Australians overseas access in-person voting services? 

• Due to the pandemic and security concerns in some locations, not all Australian diplomatic

•

missions were able to offer in-person voting services.
In November 2021, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) requested advice from
overseas posts on the support they could provide for the 2022 federal election.

• After assessing responses and risk, the AEC in collaboration with DFAT and Austrade

determined 19 posts where in-person voting could take place.

• These 19 posts issued 46 per cent of all overseas in-person votes at the 2019 federal election.
• The AEC advised overseas voters on our website of the Australian diplomatic posts where they

could vote in person and kept this information up to date throughout the election period.

Question: What about Australians overseas who couldn’t access in-person voting services? 

• The AEC and DFAT websites and social media advised all Australians overseas to apply for a
postal vote as soon as the election was announced, to give them the maximum amount of time
to receive their postal vote packs.

• For the first time, postal votes to overseas addresses were delivered from Australia by courier

to improve delivery time and reliability.

SENATE COUNTING AND ASSURANCE 

Commissioner’s summary 

Issue 

Position 

The scanning of Senate ballot papers, capture of preferences and the software 
used for Senate elections.  

After legislative change prior to the 2016 federal election, the AEC determined that 
the scanning of ballot papers to capture preferences was the only method 
available to ensure that the Senate scrutinies were completed within required 
timeframes. The solution significantly reduces the human effort, time and cost of 
capturing voter preferences in a full manual construct. There are robust controls 
and validations to ensure the continued integrity of the elections. 

Points 

• Prior to every election the AEC undertakes extensive rigorous testing, security
assessments and assurance through internal and external specialists of the
software and processes.

• At the 2022 federal election more than 108 million preferences from over
15.5 million ballot papers were scanned, data entered, and verified in
approximately four weeks after polling day.

• To ensure accuracy, all preferences are data entered by at least one human
operator and compared to captured (scanned) preferences. All interpretation
discrepancies are escalated for further action.

• The AEC is has implemented, and complies with, all components of the

Electoral Legislation Amendment (Assurance of Senate Counting) Act 2021.

• The AEC demonstrates the software used to support the scrutiny for each

Senate election is secure through security risk assessments which includes
AEC and provider systems.

• The AEC engaged an external company to complete the legislated on-site
assurance process during the Senate scrutiny (s273AC). This external
company oversaw the selection and inspection of ballot papers to demonstrate
the preferences have been correctly captured within AEC systems. This
process was open to inspection by scrutineers. Nationally, the identified
exception rate for the 2022 federal election was 0.45%.

• Scrutineers can monitor all processing of Senate ballot papers at Central

Senate Scrutiny centres in each state and territory.

• The AEC manages all aspects of the Senate count process, including

formality, in accordance with the legislation.

• Once all preferences from all ballot papers are captured, the AEC uses

EasyCount – Senate to run the distribution of preferences for Senate elections
in accordance with legislative requirements.

• The software enables reporting and auditing of the results.

Talking points 

Accuracy Assurance 

Question: What controls are in place to give assurance of accuracy? 

• Every preference captured is entered by human operators and overseen by scrutineers.
• The AEC conducts extensive rigorous testing and assurance processes for both the Senate

scanning and Senate count systems before they are accepted for use.

• Testing and assurance is done in conjunction with Australian Signals Directorate and other

relevant government agencies.

• There are numerous integrity checks inherent in the system during the scrutiny, including

interpretation discrepancy checks between scanned and data entered preferences, defined
workflow rules for different ballot paper scenarios, scrutineer challenges, and reconciliation
processes.

• A range of IT security measures are in place and systems are subject to extensive security

assessments in line with IRAP and Essential 8 criteria.

• An external provider ran an assurance process at the 2022 federal election to demonstrate the
preferences on the ballot papers are the preferences that are in the AEC system for that ballot
paper.

Supplementary question: What arrangements are in place for scrutineers at the scanning 
centres?  

• Scrutineers may observe the scanning, verification, and adjudication processes.
• Additional large monitors allow scrutineers to better view ballot paper preferences for more

contentious ballot papers.

• Scrutineer challenges may be escalated to the Australian Electoral Officer if they cannot be

resolved at the time.

• The scrutineer can request the physical ballot paper to assist in resolving a query.
• The scrutineers are able to observe the on-site assurance process, the results of which have

been published on the AEC website.

Question: Is the software used to run Senate elections secure from cyber-attacks? 

• The software used for running Senate elections has undergone multiple independent audits,
including an independent assessment as part of the ASD’s Information Security Registered
Assessor Program (IRAP). There were no issues identified that would affect the integrity of the
count.
In addition, the AEC is supported by the Australian Cyber Security Centre in assessing internal
certification and risk mitigation relating to the Senate Scanning solution.

•

• The AEC continues to work with our partner security agencies to ensure our cyber security

arrangements are commensurate with the ever-increasing threat environment.

--- Page 41 ---

No: 44.2 

Supplementary question: What is an IRAP assessment? 

• The Infosec Registered Assessors Program (IRAP) is maintained by the Australian Cyber
Security Centre (ACSC), within the Australian Signals Directorate (ASD). The program
endorses independent cyber security professionals as &#34;IRAP Assessors&#34;, which demonstrates
that an assessor is suitably qualified and able to perform cyber security assessments in
alignment with Australian Government guidance and frameworks.

• Endorsed IRAP assessors assist in securing systems and data by independently assessing

applicable cyber security posture, identifying any security risks and suggesting associated
mitigation measures.

The Distribution of Preferences 

Question: Does EasyCount – Senate accurately distribute the preferences in accordance with the 
Commonwealth Electoral Act? 

• Yes, EasyCount – Senate has been rigorously tested and assured through Government best

practise IT and security measures.

• AEC publishes the full set of preferences captured from Senate ballot papers during the

election and this is available in full after election completion. Multiple people use this data to
run the distribution of preferences on their own software and compare their results with AEC’s.
This has consistently shown the results published by AEC are correct.

• The AEC tested and implemented changes to the count process from legislative change in

2021, which was in use for the 2022 federal election.

• The AEC will implement the new legislative requirement prior to the 2024-25 federal election,

for an external assessor to verify the count system distributes preferences and elects
candidates in accordance with requirements in the Electoral Act.

Question: Has the AEC purchased software from Scytl? What was the software used for? 

• As part of the response to the significant legislative changes to the Senate voting and counting
requirements prior to the 2016 federal election, the AEC worked concurrently with a range of
stakeholders on a suitable solution for counting the Senate under the new legislation. One of
the vendors engaged was Scytl and Scytl delivered a software count solution to the AEC.
• The AEC has not used Scytl software, nor any component of the software, for any federal
election. The updated version of AEC’s EasyCount software has been used exclusively for
counting for Senate elections.

Question: Will the AEC make the source code of the software used for Senate elections public? 

• The code for EasyCount – Senate base software is used in a commercial capacity to assist the
AEC to run Commercial and Industrial Elections. At this stage the AEC has not released the
source code.

No: 44.2 

Assurance 

• All scanning and data capture is open to scrutineers.
• All distribution of preference data is published after the event on results.aec.gov.au (AEC Tally

Room).

• For the 2022 federal election, the AEC conducted extensive testing and assurance of the

Senate scanning process, including the data capture and validity of images compared to the
physical ballot papers. These processes confirmed the accuracy of the Senate scanning
process.

• A ballot paper assurance process was conducted at each Senate counting centre throughout

the scrutiny which was observed by scrutineers.

Formality 

• The AEC follows the legislative framework of the Electoral Act and relevant case law, which

defines the formality rules the AEC must implement.

POLLING PLACE TECHNOLOGY – ECLs

Commissioner’s summary 

Issue 
Position 

Points 

The Polling Place Technology MYEFO measure and the benefits it will provide. 
This investment will see the number of Electronic Certified Lists significantly 
increase from 5,500 to 10,000 for the next federal election, as well as the 
development and implementation of a new digital tool for polling place Officers in 
Charge. The tool will integrate with the AEC Command Centre and other systems, 
enhancing polling place connectedness and improving issues resolution.  
• Polling Place Technology measure announced through MYEFO 2020-21.
$24.4 million over four years from 2020-21 to increase the use of ECLs.
•
• Over 5,500 ECLs were used at the 2022 election to issue over 5.6 million

votes.

• The AEC plans to increase this to 10,000 at the next election.

Talking points 

• This investment will deliver enhanced digital solutions that improve the scalability of the

electronic certified list (ECL) to assist voter franchise and voter compliance, as well as user
experience and operational effectiveness.

• Polling Place Technology (PPT) is an integral part of delivering efficient polling services and

includes:

o Modern, portable devices

o An application that interacts with AEC enterprise solutions

o A secure network

• ECLs are portable devices, being used by issuing officers in all pre-poll voting centres, mobile
polling teams, including remote area mobile polling, and selected high volume polling locations
on election day.

• ECLs allow polling officials to efficiently search the approved list of eligible voters and

electronically record that a person has been handed a ballot paper in accordance with the
Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918.

• The AEC deployed over 5,500 devices for the 2022 federal election, using enhanced ECL

application capability to address scalability issues, and is planning to deploy approximately
10,000 devices for the 2024/25 federal election.

• The MYEFO measure also includes funding for the development and implementation of a new
digital tool for polling place Officers in Charge. The Officers in Charge will be able to connect to
AEC systems which will support more efficient and connected polling place management
activities and resolution of operational issues.

• This digital polling place management tool will replace paper OIC Returns that are currently in

use. Paper Returns do not support real time communication with decision makers or efficient
polling place management.

VOTER VERIFICATION 

Commissioner’s summary 

Issue 

The impact of voter verification. 

Position 

Voter verification is entirely a matter for the Parliament. 

Points 

•

Identification is required when enrolling to vote.

• Under the Electoral Act, voter verification when casting a vote is not required.

Any introduction of this would require legislative change.

•

Introducing voter verification would have an impact on the efficiency of vote
issuing and counting. It may also impact voter enfranchisement.

• A previous JSCEM report has recommended the Electoral Act be amended
to require voters to present a form of acceptable identification to be issued
with an ordinary pre-poll or election day vote.

• We are aware of previous bills that proposed changes to the Electoral Act to

include voter identification provisions. From the 46th Parliament:

o Commonwealth Electoral Amendment (Integrity of Elections) Bill 2021

[Malcolm Roberts]

o Electoral Legislation Amendment (Voter Integrity) Bill 2021 [Ben Morton]

• Any consideration of proposed legislative amendments is a matter for the

Parliament.

Talking points 

Question: What would be the operational and other impacts of introducing voter verification? 

•

Impacts could include:

- increased time to issue votes, including queue times
- increased costs of technology, materials, training and staff
- higher number of declaration votes, which are more time-consuming to process and

count resulting in less votes able to be counted on election night

- a large communication and education campaign required
- significant changes to business processes and training.

• Careful design and management would be required to ensure that groups of eligible voters are

•

not disenfranchised.
Legislative change would be required to enforce voter verification processes and to provide
clarity of requirements for the AEC, voters and other stakeholders.

• The introduction of voter verification does not eliminate the possibility of administrative errors

resulting in multiple marks, or electors attempting to vote more than once.

Candidate qualification checklist 

Commissioner’s summary 

Issue 

Position 

The requirements to review and publish qualification checklists and supporting 
documents at the 2022 federal election. The eligibility of electoral candidates 
under section 44 of the Constitution. 

The AEC is required to check that all mandatory questions on the qualification 
checklist are answered. It does not determine the accuracy of the answers or the 
potential impact on a candidate’s eligibility. The eligibility of a person to be chosen 
as a Senator or member of the House of Representatives under the Constitution is 
a matter for the High Court sitting as the Court of Disputed Returns. 
The mandatory qualification checklist was in place for all candidates seeking to 
nominate for the 2022 federal election. 1,624 checklists totalling 17,117 pages 
were published. 

Points 

• The AEC was not required to check the accuracy of the information provided

on the checklist, nor determine whether it impacted on eligibility.

• The checklist is a self-assessment tool which puts the onus on candidates to
satisfy themselves, and the Australian people, that they are eligible to be
elected under section 44 of the Constitution. It contains a mix of mandatory
and voluntary questions.

• The wording of the questions in the checklist is dictated by the legislation.

• The Electoral Act requires the Electoral Commissioner to publish the

qualification checklist and any additional documents provided by a candidate
as soon as practicable after nominations for an election are declared.

• At the 2022 federal election, declaration of nominations occurred on 22 April

2022.

• The AEC published qualification checklists and any supporting documents for
all 1,624 candidates on our website on 25 April 2022 and they were removed
on 2 August 2022 and copies of the qualification checklists for elected
candidates provided to parliament.

• Future publishing: The AEC will publish qualification checklists as soon as

practicable following the declaration of nominations but cannot put a timeframe
on this due to the rigorous quality assurance processes to be undertaken first.

Question: Why doesn’t the AEC check the eligibility of candidates to stand for election? 
• The qualification checklist puts the onus on candidates to satisfy themselves, and the

Australian people, that they are eligible to be elected under section 44 of the Constitution.

• The AEC has no legal authority to check the eligibility of candidates.
• The Electoral Act only requires and permits the AEC to check that all mandatory questions on
the checklist have been answered, and that additional documents have been provided if
necessary.

COMMONWEALTH PROCUREMENT RULES – 
ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY 

Commissioner’s summary 

Issue 

Position 

Recent amendment to the Commonwealth Procurement Rules have now included 
an explicit requirement to include climate change impacts in relevant financial and 
non-financial considerations when making a value for money assessment. 

The AEC procures goods and services consistent with the Public Governance 
Performance and Accountability Act and Commonwealth Procurement Rules. 

The AEC applies these rules through its accountable authority instructions, 
supporting operational guidelines, and by developing procurement skills and 
processes to improve efficiency and value-for-money outcomes. 

Points 

• Assessment of Environmental considerations in determining value for money
already exists. However, they have now been amended to include specific
reference to climate change impacts.

• The AEC maintains contemporary knowledge of, and applies, Commonwealth

Policy regarding Procurement activities. This includes assessment of
environmental sustainability of the proposed goods and services as applicable
to each procurement.

• Specifically addressing climate change within AEC procurement activities may

require a more coordinated policy led approach to maintain a simple yet
effective method of applying and measuring.

Talking points 

Question: Can outline how you meet these requirements within your procurement framework? 

The AEC procures goods and services in accordance with the Commonwealth Resource 
Framework.  

The AEC has centralised expertise to manage its procurement and contracting framework, 
including panel arrangements. Tenders are evaluated for: 

•
•
•
•

value for money;
energy and consumption demand;
unnecessary consumption;
end-of-life disposal arrangements.

The value for money assessment includes climate changes impacts as a result of the changes 
made to the CPRs effective 1 July 2022.

No: 49 

Question: Can you nominate some of the practicable ways you have lowered the environmental 
impacts of your procurements and contracts? 

Each activity has its own unique requirements. For example: 

• Evaluating suppliers’ environmental credentials during tenders;
• Use of recycled content for cardboard polling equipment;
•

Leveraging the WoAG arrangement for office supplies which strengthens the
Commonwealth’s overall position to effect supplier behaviour;

• Application of the Australian Packaging Covenant;
• Recycling or donating end of life products rather than send to landfill

(the AEC is currently holding donations following FE2022 while planning for a referendum is
underway)

Question: Can you advise how the AEC might specifically consider climate change impacts in 
future procurement activities? 

Specifically addressing climate change within AEC procurement activities may require a more 
coordinated and policy led approach at the Commonwealth level. The AEC has engaged with the 
APS Net Zero Unit at the Department of Finance to ensure the AEC’s approach is consistent with 
whole of government future direction on managing environmental impacts. 

For example, it is difficult to identify the specific impact that supplying pencils for the use of voters 
has on climate change in a way that does not have a significant administrative impact on suppliers. 

The AEC will have to review its current practices to see if we can identify a simple yet effective 
method of applying and measuring climate change impacts. Importantly this must balance 
Commonwealth policy as well as impacts to potential suppliers, which range from very small to 
large suppliers.  

Additionally, elections have to be undertaken in a particular way under the requirements of the 
Commonwealth Electoral Act which tend to be more resource intensive (i.e. voting in person).

COWPER COUNT – 2022 FEDERAL ELECTION 

Commissioner’s summary 

Issue 

Position 

Variance in House of Representatives results for Pauline Hanson’s One Nation 
(PHON) candidate Faye Aspiotis in the Port Macquarie West Cowper PPVC for 
the 2022 federal election. 

We are aware in the counting centre in Cowper, some House of Representatives 
ballot papers were combined across different pre-poll voting centre counts on 
polling night. This did not impact overall results for any candidates in the division. 

Points 

• PHON Secretary Damian Huxham wrote to the AEC on 5 September 2022

seeking an explanation of the variance of One Nation’s House of
Representatives results between the Port Macquarie West Cowper PPVC and
the Port Macquarie West polling place.

• The AEC responded that variances in candidate results between polling
locations are common, however we are aware of an issue in the Cowper
counting centre where some House of Representatives ballot papers were
combined across different pre-poll voting centre counts on polling night, which
may have contributed.

• This administrative error has no impact on the results of the election for the

division as all votes were counted, but results were reported against different
polling places.

• An investigation at the time established that all ballot papers could be
accounted for. A re-examination of the data shows the same outcome.

Call Centre worker recordings – Senate ATL/Dickson 

Commissioner’s summary 

Issue 

Position 

Election call centre workers were allegedly providing false voting information to 
electors regarding electoral processes (Senate ballot paper ATL / Dickson). 
The AEC employs 105,000 temporary staff, many for a single day, who provide 
guidance to voters. A small number of individual accounts are not a representative 
of instructions provided across an operation of more than 8,000 voting venues and 
millions of individual interactions, including hundreds of thousands of public 
enquiries. 

Points 

During the election, the AEC became aware of video posts on social media, 
depicting alleged recordings of call centre staff providing information about 
electoral processes.  
• The AEC is unable to verify the authenticity of allegations without revisiting

hundreds of thousands of public enquiries.

• The structure of the Senate ballot paper is determined by the Commonwealth

Electoral Act 1918.

• Under the Act, candidates who are not endorsed by a political party, but have
chosen to be grouped on the ballot, are entitled to a box above the line.
However, they are not entitled to have any name or logo placed against their
box.

• Mr Dickson lodged a submission (Submission 279) with JSCEM in relation to

this matter and the AEC provided a response to the Chair of JSCEM in
November 2022

Talking points 

Question: Did AEC election call centre workers providing false voting information to electors 
regarding the Senate ballot paper? 

• The AEC employs 105,000 temporary staff in an election, who provide guidance to voters.

• A small number of individual accounts are not a representative of instructions provided across
an operation of more than 8,000 voting venues and millions of individual interactions, including
hundreds of thousands of public enquiries.

• The AEC is unable to verify this claim without revisiting hundreds of thousands of public

enquiries.

• Call centre staff are trained and required to complete an assessment to confirm their level of

understanding of training content. Training is a mix of face to face and online.

• Call centre scripts are used by staff to ensure they are providing accurate information to the
public. They are also supported by the first-tier escalation team. If the escalation team are
unable to resolve the enquiry, it gets escalated to more senior AEC staff.

ELECTION TIME PUBLIC INFORMATION CAMPAIGN 

Commissioner’s summary 

Issue 
Position 

Points 

Federal election participation information campaign. 
The AEC conducted a large-scale communication campaign at the 2022 federal 
election to inform and encourage Australian voters to effectively participate. 
• The AEC’s 2022 election campaign was run to help voters to effectively

participate and to support electoral integrity.

• Targeted at all eligible voters (all Australian citizens 18 years and over), it

included specific and translated information to reach voters from culturally and
linguistically diverse (CALD) backgrounds, voters with a disability and First
Nations voters.

• The campaign ran over three phases from Sunday 10 April (election

announcement) to Saturday 21 May (election day).

• The three participation phases were: i) close of rolls (encouraging people to
enrol before the deadline); ii) voter services (early voting options); and iii)
formality (how to complete your ballot papers correctly).

• This was supported by Stop and Consider (disinformation) messaging

•

throughout the election period, and COVID-19 safety measures information.
It was a multi-channel campaign using advertising, social media, website,
community and media outreach, polling place products and household delivery
of an official guide. The campaign included partnerships with NITV, Snapchat
and SBS.

• Over 1,000+ advertisements across TV, radio, press, cinema, out of home,

digital and social media.

• Advertising translated into 52 languages (32 CALD and 20 First Nations).
• The media placement spend for the 2022 federal election was $19 million

(GST inclusive).

• The campaign performed well and achieved reach and frequency of its

messaging among the target audience.

• The AEC implements an internal certification process on its advertising

campaign, which is externally published on campaign launch. It has a long-
standing exemption from the review and approval processes of government
advertising campaigns.

Talking points 

Question: What did the AEC do to inform voters of the COVID-19 safety measures at the 2022 
election?  

•  The AEC provided information on the range of COVID-19 safety measures as a key part of the 

campaign. 

•  This included specific advertising, and messaging across other channels such as the official 

guide delivered to all households, social media and detailed information on the AEC website.  

Question: How did the AEC’s election-time campaign promote early voting? 

•  Given the compulsory nature of voting, the campaign provided voters with information on how 

they can participate if they cannot vote on election day. 

•  This information was prefaced by messages regarding eligibility for early voting, indicating that 
early voting is available for people who are unable to make it to a polling place on election day.

GILMORE COUNT 

Commissioner’s summary 

Issue 
Position 

Points 

Count for the division of Gilmore at the 2022 federal election. 
Recount requests made by the Liberal Party candidate were considered and not 
granted in accordance with the Electoral Act and AEC policy.   
• Section 279 of the Act provides that a candidate can request a recount of
ballot papers at any time before the declaration of the result of a House of
Representatives election.

• The AEC was satisfied that the scrutiny process was properly conducted and

that scrutineers had the opportunity to observe all relevant steps of the
scrutiny process as required under the Electoral Act.

• Fiona Phillips was declared elected as Member of the House of

Representatives for the Division of Gilmore with a margin of 373 votes
following distribution of preferences.

Talking points 

Question: When does a recount of House of Representatives ballot papers occur? 

• Section 279 of the Electoral Act makes provision for the recount of House of Representatives

ballot papers.

• A candidate may make a request for a recount.  The candidate must set out reasons for

request.

• The Divisional Returning Officer (DRO), Australian Electoral Officer (AEO), or the Electoral

Commissioner (EC) may determine that a recount is to occur.

• As a matter of procedure, an automatic recount will occur if the margin between the two leading

candidates, after distribution of preferences, is less than 100 votes.

Question: Was a request for a recount received for the Division of Gilmore? If so what was the 
outcome? 

• A request for a recount for the Division of Gilmore was made by the Liberal Party candidate, Mr

Andrew Constance to the DRO for Gilmore.

• The request was considered and decision made to deny the request in accordance with s279

of the Electoral Act by the DRO.

• A further request was made to the EC which was also considered and denied, based on the
conclusion that the scrutiny process for the election for the Division of Gilmore was properly
conducted in accordance with the Electoral Act.

Question: What is the process for considering a candidate’s request for a recount? 

• Section 279 of the Electoral Act makes provision for the recount of House of Representatives
ballot papers including that a candidate can make a request for a recount to the DRO at any
time before the declaration of the result.

• The AEC’s House of Representatives Recount Policy and standard operating procedure

provides guidance to staff on the management and evaluation of recount requests made in
accordance with s279.

•

Information regarding recounts including how to make a request and guidelines on how a
request will be evaluated is also provided to candidates in the Candidates Handbook.

Question: What issues were raised by the candidate in the request for a recount? What was the 
AEC’s response to these issues?  

• The reasons provided in the request for recount included that scrutineers had not had the

opportunity to inspect and challenge votes which had been declared as informal and that votes
declared as informal should again be reviewed for formality.

•

In declining the request for a recount, the DRO was satisfied that there were no errors or
irregularities that may have materially affected the election result and noting the margin of 373
votes, concluded that there was not sufficient reasons to support that a recount might change
the result.

• Furthermore, the DRO was satisfied that the scrutiny process was properly conducted and that
scrutineers had the opportunity to observe all relevant steps of the scrutiny process as required
under the Electoral Act.

Question: Was a request made to the Count of Disputed Returns? 

• There was no request to the Court of Disputed Returns for a review in the division of Gilmore or

any other division nationally.

2GB DISCARDED BALLOT PAPERS 
FOUND – PORT MACQUARIE  

Commissioner’s summary 

Issue 

2GB Ben Fordham Breakfast Show aired/published a story on 22 June 2022 
suggesting a listener had found completed ballot papers in a bin in Port 
Macquarie. 

Position 

The AEC upholds electoral integrity and public trust in electoral processes and 
has strong ballot paper handling policies that all staff are trained to adhere to. 

Points 

• The AEC’s investigation into the discarded ballot papers is ongoing.

• At this stage the finding is that the completed ballot papers are likely to have
been discarded declaration ballot papers (that is, an out-of-area voter should
have returned their completed ballot paper to be placed inside a completed
declaration envelope, but in these instances, they have likely not been
returned as per the instruction).

•

Initial indications are that the ballot papers are likely informal, and due to the
small number, there is no impact on the result of any electoral division.

• There is no evidence regarding their origin that points to an operational issue

impacting the election.

Talking points 

Question: Why were completed ballot papers found in a bin in Port Macquarie? 

• The AEC’s investigation into the discarded ballot papers is ongoing and a report will be written

once finalised.

• At this stage the finding is that the completed ballot papers are likely to have been discarded
declaration ballot papers (that is, an out-of-area voter should have returned their completed
ballot paper to be placed inside a completed declaration envelope, but in these instances they
have likely not been returned as per the instruction).

• Ballot papers in the AEC’s possession (prior to issuing to a voter in-person or via post, or after

receipt of completed ballots from a voter) are tracked from point to point with a range of
security measures in place.

• Ballot papers in a voter’s possession (e.g. when voting via post or in-person) are the

responsibility of the voter themselves to return to the AEC in the required timeframe in order to
be counted.

The\n\nDecember 2022 estimate is a national Indigenous enrolment rate of 84.5 per cent.\n\n\u2022 The Indigenous enrolment rate has grown consistently from 74.7 per cent in 2017 to\n\n84.5 per cent in December 2022.\n\n\u2022 While any gap between non-Indigenous and Indigenous enrolment rates is disappointing, it is\n\nencouraging to see that estimated Indigenous enrolment rates have been increasing over time.\n\n\u2022 The AEC is also undertaking considerable work to improve the effectiveness of its FDEU direct\n\nenrolment program for First Nations people.\n\n- Three trial activities were completed in the second half of 2022 which added an estimated\n\n15,500 First Nations people to the roll. In light of trial outcomes, changes to the\nmainstream FDEU program have been adopted and we expect this to lead to further\nincreases in the Indigenous enrolment rate.\n\n- One further trial activity will commence in February 2023.\n\n\u2022 As part of the Enhancing Indigenous Electoral Participation project, the AEC ran the first\nphase of a targeted enrolment advertising campaign in November/December 2022, with a\nfurther phase planned in the first half of 2023.\n\n\u2022 The AEC\u2019s Indigenous Electoral Participation Program is also working to support electoral\nparticipation of First Nations peoples through establishing partnerships, working with State and\nTerritory agencies to undertake remote enrolment work, and delivering targeted and culturally\nappropriate services and information.\n\n\u2022 The AEC is currently expanding and enhancing its remote polling services to offer an improved\n\nlevel of service in more locations.\n\nPage 2 of 40 \n\nLEX3715 Released Document No. 26Released under the Freedom of Information Act 1982\n\n\n--- Page 16 ---\n\nNo: 28.2 \n\nIndigenous enrolment estimates \n\nCommissioner\u2019s summary \n\nIssue \n\nPosition \n\nPoints \n\nDespite steady increases, there is still a gap between the national enrolment rates \nand the estimated Indigenous enrolment rate. \nWhile any gap between non-Indigenous and Indigenous enrolment rates is \ndisappointing, it is encouraging to see that estimated enrolment rates for First \nNations Australians are increasing over time. \nHeadlines \n\n\u2022 Updated AEC estimates show that an additional 21,000 Indigenous Australians\n\nhave enrolled to vote between the end of June 2022 to the end December 2022,\nbringing the national estimated Indigenous enrolment rate up to 84.5% (up\n2.8%).\n\n\u2022 The rapid rise easily represents the largest increase since estimates were first\n\ncalculated in this manner by the AEC in 2017.\n\n\u2022 We continue to work really hard in getting as many people to enrol as possible,\nwith a particular focus on young Australians and Indigenous Australians who\naren\u2019t enrolled at as high a rate as others.\n\n\u2022 The AEC\u2019s recent direct enrolment trials are proving successful.

As such, planning was\nundertaken on the basis of existing legislation, accounting for potential\nchanges in voting patterns. This included the Contingency Measures Act which\nenabled the Electoral Commissioner to make limited operational modifications\nby legislative instrument where an emergency declaration was in place under\na Commonwealth law and the COVID Enfranchisement Act 2022, which\nexpanded telephone voting to provide contingency for electors in mandatory\nisolation or quarantine due to COVID-19.\n\n\u2022 Risk: The AEC actively engaged with stakeholders and vendors to understand\nthe requirements to deliver an election with COVID-19 safety measures. This\nincluded managing health risks and from a materials perspective, issues with\nsupplier procurement and lead times, product availability, and the resultant\ncost impacts. The AEC had a dedicated response unit to actively monitor the\nCOVID-19 environment including the changing nature of the pandemic in each\njurisdiction and the impact on and response required for the election. We\ndeveloped contingency plans to respond to evolving conditions.\n\n\u2022 Staff: Additional staff were engaged in polling places and counting centres to\nmanage voter queues, perform touch point cleaning, and undertake vote\nissuing and counting to ensure physical distancing was maintained where\npossible. All staff engaged for the federal election were required to be\nvaccinated and wear masks.\n\nTalking points \n\nQuestion: Was the AEC prepared to deliver an election if there was a snap lockdown announced \nduring the polling period?  \n\n\u2022 Our planning and delivery models were designed to allow the AEC to be agile and respond to a\n\nchanging environment, particularly during this time.\n\n\u2022 The AEC actively worked through additional contingency planning to maximise the availability\n\nof voting services for all Australians.\n\n\u2022 The AEC worked to the advice provided by federal and local health authorities.\n\u2022 The AEC had contingencies in place to deliver an election should there be additional\n\nrestrictions in place during polling in one or more locations.

These applications were processed by our\npartner, Computershare in all states and territories.\nThe remaining 12.5% were sent to general postal voters, who automatically receive ballot\npapers in the mail after an election has been announced.\nThe AEC received 2,382,267 completed postal votes before 13 day deadline after polling day.\nThis represents a return rate of 87%, higher than the 2019 return rate of 84.1%.\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\nQuestion: How did the AEC engage with key stakeholders to successfully deliver postal voting in \n2022? \n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\nThe AEC recognised early in the preparation for the 2022 event that both the COVID-19\npandemic and international experience would likely have a significant effect on postal voting.\nWe expected significantly high volumes of applications, greater scrutiny and challenges with\nproduction and lodgement.\nThe AEC leveraged strong relationships with the AEC\u2019s postal vote provider Computershare\nand with Australia Post to ensure success. These partners provided their expertise to co-\ndesign materials and processes that mitigated risks and improved voter experience.\n\nBranch \nContact \n\nDelivery and Support Branch \nNatasha Scandrett, A/g Assistant Commissioner \n\nUpdated \nPrinted \n\n23/01/2023 \n23/01/2023 8:46 AM \n\nLEX3715 Released DocumentReleased under the Freedom of Information Act 1982\n\n\n--- Page 30 ---\n\nNo: 39 \n\n\u2022  This engagement was conducted at multiple levels of all three organisations and evolved into \n\ngovernance and delivery activities during the event. \n\n\u2022  The AEC knew that a proportion of the expected volume of applications would be attributed to \npolitical party/candidate led PVA distribution. To ensure that the PVAs distributed would be \ncompliant and provided direct to Computershare, the AEC published the PVA Management \nGuide on the Candidate Hub. This guide provided key information as well as QR artwork that \ncould be added to materials as needed. Specific guides were also created for each \nComputershare or TIMG site, with specific opening times and access requirements. \n\n\u2022  The AEC pursued legislative changes to the requirements for a Postal Vote Certificate in order \n\nto be able to produce the higher volumes expected.  \n\n\u2022  The short period between the passing of legislative changes and the announcement of the \n\nelection did not allow for direct voter engagement. To ensure voter needs were met the AEC: \n\no  Sourced an experienced, external form designer to provide specialist advice and \n\nensure voter needs and behaviours were catered for in the design of new materials \nInserted pictorial instructions on the inside of the new PVC \n\no \no  Tested materials with AEC staff and their families \no  Produced and published a video demonstration of how to complete a postal vote \n\nwhich was viewed over 120,000 times \n\no  Updated and added guidance on the AEC website \n\n\u2022  The AEC is currently working on enhancing the postal vote design further to enhance the user \n\nexperience and maximise enfranchisement. \n\nQuestion: What was the effect of legislative changes made in 2021? \n\nModernised design \n\nThe legislative change in 2021 allowed AEC the opportunity to rethink the design and function of \nthe postal voting materials sent to voters. During the redesign process AEC staff considered the \ndifficulties faced and complaints made by voters in previous elections, production efficiencies and \nmaterial durability. \n\nTo mitigate the voter concerns the AEC: \n\n\u2022  Engaged an experienced form designer to provide specialist advice and ensure voter needs \n\nand behaviours were catered for in the design \n\n\u2022  Provided every voter with a return envelope in which both their ballot paper and personal \n\ndetails were secure. \n\n\u2022  Printed completion instructions with supporting images inside the certificate. \n\u2022  Produced and published a video demonstration of how to complete a postal vote.  \n\no  This video was accessed via a QR code within the postal vote certificate (PVC).  \no  Captions for the video were translated and available in 19 different languages \no  The video was viewed over 97,000 times over April and May 2022 and was also \npublished on our AEC TV YouTube channel which has also been viewed over \n31,000 times. \n\nThe AEC worked with our partners, Computershare, to design a PVC that did not have to be glued \ninto an envelope. Whilst a seemingly small feature of the previous design, this change: \n\n\u2022  Eliminated multiple risks including: \n\no  Availability of sub-contracted services: during our preparations only one supplier in \n\nAustralia was able to provide folding and gluing services \n\no  Ballot paper security and voter privacy: the new PVC was produced only by \nComputershare and did not need to be transported to other suppliers. \n\n\u2022  Significantly increased production and ensured that postal materials were dispatched to \n\napplicants in the shortest timeframe possible. \n\nPage 2 of 6 \n\nLEX3715 Released Document No. 37Released under the Freedom of Information Act 1982\n\n\n--- Page 31 ---\n\nNo: 39 \n\n\u2022  Provided greater control and allowed Computershare to organise additional shifts when \n\nnecessary. \n\nTo ensure the new materials, specifically the return envelope, were compliant with Australia Post \nrequirements the AEC also ran lodgement trials. These successful trials provided assurance that \nnot only did the materials meet the addressing requirements to ensure efficient sorting by Australia \nPost, but also that the ballot papers could be securely returned to the AEC without damage.  \n\nBallot paper extraction prior to election day \n\nNew legislation allowing votes from declaration envelopes to be extracted from the Monday prior to \nelection day enabled the AEC to process a large number of postal vote results faster after election \nday. By the Tuesday after election day, results for over 750,000 House of Representatives postal \nvotes were known, in comparison to just over 200,000 at the same time for the 2019 federal \nelection. \n\nQuestion: How were PVAs managed during the 2022 election? \n\nPVA scanning and data capture services were provided by Computershare. The co-designed \nsolution provided the following improvements to PVA management: \n\n\u2022  To increase use of the online option, a QR code was added to the approved PVA artwork. \n\u2022  Where possible Computershare were provided with candidate/party PVA artwork prior to the \nannouncement of the election. This allowed Computershare to pre-program their systems to \nrecognise and capture completed forms without requiring manual input by AEC staff. \n\n\u2022  Paper PVAs were sent directly to Computershare to reduce double handling and ensure data \n\nwas captured from PVAs as soon as possible. \n\n\u2022  PVAs were sent to Computershare via a number of methods: \n\no  Candidates and parties could deliver bulk PVAs to Computershare or TIMG sites in \n\neach state and territory \n\no  Voters could email, fax or post their completed PVA. \n\nQuestion: How many PVAs were received from political parties in the 2022 election? What were \nthe challenges with these PVAs? \n\nOverall the AEC received 893,243 paper PVAs of which 551, 274 (61%) can be directly attributed \nto political parties. The single consequence of direct delivery of PVAs to Computershare was that, \ndue to a lack of information provided on packaging or made available to couriers, Computershare \ncould not accurately record the source of the remaining 39% of paper PVAs.  \n\nIn addition, the following challenges arose: \n\n\u2022 \n\nsome political parties chose to make significant changes to the approved PVA artwork, \nincluding removing the QR code. Each significant change needed to be reviewed by the AEC \nto ensure compliance and led to a delay in production. \n\n\u2022 \n\n\u2022  The AEC was not provided with all versions of the PVA artwork used by political parties and \ncandidates. This led to PVAs distributed in particular areas with an incorrect return address. \nWhilst the address used was managed by the AEC, it was collected by a different supplier and \nled to double handling and delays in processing. \nLate engagement by both the ALP and Liberal Party with regard to their online applications did \nnot provide adequate time for the AEC to conduct full risk assessments and mitigations. \nIn line with the previous events, many queries and complaints were received from voters that \nhad not received their postal materials despite returning a paper PVA up to 2 weeks prior to \nthe complaint. Upon further enquiry it was found that the PVA in question had been returned to \nthe political party and not yet received by the AEC. \n\n\u2022 \n\nPage 3 of 6 \n\nLEX3715 Released Document No. 37Released under the Freedom of Information Act 1982\n\n\n--- Page 32 ---\n\nNo: 39 \n\nQuestion: In light of the negative comments regarding postal ballots at elections overseas, what \ndoes the AEC do to ensure the integrity of postal voting in Federal Elections? \n\n\u2022  Postal voting has been an integral part of Australian elections since before Federation and like \n\nall AEC processes is strictly governed by legislation and AEC policies and procedures. \n\n\u2022  The procedures for postal voting are governed by Part XV of the Commonwealth Electoral Act \n\n1918 (the Electoral Act). \n\n\u2022  Every postal vote returned to the AEC must be matched to an elector before it is included in \n\nthe count. \n\n\u2022  The matching process includes the following preliminary scrutiny: \n\n\u25aa  Name and address match \n\u25aa  Postal vote signed by elector \n\u25aa  Witness requirements \n\u25aa  Check that the elector and witness declarations are dated on or before polling day \n\u25aa  Checks of signatures if deemed necessary \n\u25aa \n\nIf the elector has already cast a declaration vote that has been counted (whether that be \nby postal, absent or provisional) the vote is not included in the count. \n\n\u2022  To ensure the secrecy of the ballot, there is a specific process whereby postal votes that are to \nbe included into the count have their ballot papers removed with the elector details facing \ndown, and the ballot papers are then placed in a ballot box and counted separately in batches. \nLike all processes regarding the counting of ballot papers, these processes can be observed \nby scrutineers. \n\n\u2022 \n\nQuestion: Did the increase in postal votes slow down the count and make it longer for seats to be \ndeclared? \n\nThere are a number of factors that impact the speed of the count and the AECs ability to declare \nthe poll in each division. One of these factors is the requirement to wait until 13 days after election \nday to receive returned postal votes, however the 2022 event saw other factors, including the \nincrease in the number of candidates and voters marking a first preference for candidates other \nthan the two-candidate preferred candidates, also affect the AEC\u2019s ability to declare. \n\nNew legislation that allowed ballots to be extracted from PVCs from the Monday before polling day \ndid assist to increase the speed of the count, as did the changes to allow the unfolding and initial \nsorting of ordinary votes taken at pre-poll voting centres from 4pm on polling day. Further \nlegislative change, such as beginning these processes earlier and streamlining declaration voting \nmay further allow the AEC to provide earlier indicative results in line with public expectations. \n\n\u2022  While the Electoral Act requires electors to cast their postal vote before 6pm on polling day, \nthe AEC is required to wait until 13 days after election day to receive returned postal votes. \n\u2022  A seat cannot be declared until the number of potential votes yet to be counted (which until the \n\n13th day includes all postal votes issued) cannot change the outcome. \n\n\u2022  This can mean that votes that may decide the election may not be received until almost \n2 weeks after polling day. Therefore, if there is a greater percentage of postal votes, the \nlikelihood of these votes delaying declaration is higher (particularly in marginal or close seats). \n\n\u2022  The AEC\u2019s integrity process for the return of postal votes also means that there are more \n\nchecks and balances required than counting ordinary ballot papers cast in a physical polling \nplace. This too can slow down the count and is resource intensive. The AEC applies the same \nintegrity processes to all returned postal votes, regardless of whether the result of a seat or the \nelection is beyond doubt.  \n\nPage 4 of 6 \n\nLEX3715 Released Document No. 37Released under the Freedom of Information Act 1982\n\n\n--- Page 33 ---\n\nNo: 39 \n\nPostal voting talking points \n\n\u2022 When electors apply online for a postal vote application the AEC has full digital visibility of\neach individual application and its status. This is the way the majority (56% in 2022) of\napplications are received. When electors apply using a paper postal vote application, they can\nbe received by the AEC through a number of channels including through third parties such as\npolitical parties.\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\nPaper forms by their nature require the data to be captured from the form and the information\nrecorded in order for the data to be included in the AEC\u2019s postal voting system and the postal\nvote sent. Previously this was done by manual data entry. However, developments in\ntechnology have allowed for a digital data capture solution. The AEC has used this digital\nsolution to capture data from paper postal vote applications for the last three federal elections.\n\nAt no stage during previous elections has the AEC had any doubt that the data from paper\napplications was being captured and postal votes actioned.\n\nComputershare Communication Services provide both the scanning of paper applications and\nthe printing and mailing of postal voting packs.\n\nComments about postal voting processes for the 2020 US elections may have meant there\nwas more scrutiny of the Australian process. Due to the preparation and engagement activities\nundertaken by AEC, the AEC did not experience a significantly higher level of scrutiny. Whilst\nsome questions and accusations were raised in social media forums, the AEC was able to\nquickly demonstrate the integrity of our processes and resolve problems as required\n\n\u2022 While the AEC attempts to match all postal vote applications to an elector on the electoral roll\nbefore dispatching the postal vote, this is not always possible. In 2022, 1.5% of the 2,731,088\npostal votes issued were not matched to an elector.\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\nThe AEC works very closely with Australia Post and Computershare to ensure postal votes are\ndelivered before the election and to facilitate their return to the AEC.  These relationships were\ncritical to the successful delivery of postal voting services.\n\nThe AEC received some publicity at the 2019 federal election when it was raised in the media\nthat a postal vote for Mr Edward (Ned) Kelly was delivered to the Glenrowan Hotel. As the\nAEC explained at the time, the legislation allows for any person to complete a PVA, however,\nthe processes upon return means the vote will only be counted if that name can be matched to\nthe address on the electoral roll.\n\n2022 federal election postal voting statistics \n\no Number of Postal Votes Issued: 2,731,088\n\no Number of Postal Votes Returned: 2,389,751\n\no Number of Postal Votes Admitted to count: 2,212,301\n\no Number of Postal Votes Partially Admitted*: 1,256\n\no Number of Postal Votes Rejected**: 176,880\n\n\u25aa\n\n\u25aa\n\n* Partially admitted means that only the Senate Ballot Paper was counted\n\n** 140,124 (79.2%) of postal votes rejected were due to no elector or witness signature\n\nPage 5 of 6 \n\nLEX3715 Released Document No. 37Released under the Freedom of Information Act 1982\n\n\n--- Page 34 ---\n\nNo: 39 \n\nRecent legislative changes \n\nElectoral Legislation Amendment (Counting, Scrutiny and Operational Efficiencies) Act 2021 \nRoyal Assent 2 September 2021 \n\nMeasure \n\nDetails \n\nRemove the requirement \nfor paper postal vote \napplications (PVAs) to be \nsent to the home division \nAllow digital process for \noverseas voters who \ncan't find an authorised \nwitness \n\nAdmitting postal vote \nballot papers outside \nPVC envelope but within \nan outer envelope \n\nAllow extraction of ballot \npapers from declaration \nvote envelopes before \npolling day \n\nThis removes the requirement to send paper PVAs in the declaration \nvote exchange. The divisions where the paper PVA is received will \nretain the paper form with other election records, to be destroyed in \naccordance with statutory authorisation.  \nUnder s 194(1A), an overseas voter who can't find a witness can \nattach to their postal vote a signed and dated statement and a \nphotocopy of their passport. This change allows them to submit their \nstatement and an image of their passport electronically. \nIf a postal ballot paper is returned inside an outer envelope but \noutside the postal vote certificate (PVC) it is currently not allowed to \nbe admitted to the count. This measure saves those votes. It enables \nthe AEC to supply a return outer envelope with the postal voting \npack, easing voters\u2019 concerns about privacy. \nThe opening of the envelopes, extracting of ballot papers, unfolding \nand reconciling, is shifted from just before further scrutiny, to just \nafter preliminary scrutiny, if it is up to five days before polling day. \nThe ballot papers will be placed in ballot boxes ready for sorting and \ncounting after the close of the poll. The AEC will extract postal votes \nfrom the Monday before election day. \nThe process where postal votes received from electors who also \nvoted with a mobile team are removed will no longer be conducted. \n\nElectoral Legislation Amendment (Contingency Measures) Act 2021 \nRoyal Assent 13 December 2021 \n\nMeasure \n\nDetails \n\nPostal vote certificate \ndoes not have to be \nprinted on an envelope \n\nChanges and impacts: \n\nThe AEC can process a postal vote certificate placed inside an \nenvelope as if it were a postal vote certificate printed on an \nenvelope.

The October 2022-23 Budget included $75.1 million over two years for preparatory work for a First Nations Voice to Parliament Referendum, with specific allocations for AEC preparations ($50.2 million) and increasing First Nations enrolment/participation ($16.1 million). An additional $160 million is provisioned in the Contingency Reserve.\n*   **Document No. 24: Financial matters**\n    *   Highlights ongoing challenges with the AEC's funding model, noting a $24.5 million loss in 2021-22 (compared to a $47.9 million surplus in 2020-21). The AEC's operating results can fluctuate significantly due to external factors impacting expenditure timing, posing risks for managing complex electoral events and electoral roll growth.\n*   **Document No. 25: Vendors, Procurements and Major Tenders**\n    *   The AEC undertakes extensive preparation and planning for procurements and tenders for federal electoral events, adhering to Commonwealth Procurement Rules (CPRs). A specific \"Referendum Procurement Plan\" is in place for a potential 2023 referendum, tracking critical procurements and contracts.\n*   **Document No. 26: Performance Statements**\n    *   The AEC's 2021-22 Annual Performance Statements indicate that 74% (14 of 19) of performance measures were met, 5% (1 of 19) were \"on track to be met,\" and 21% (4 of 19) were \"partly met\" (e.g., voter turnout, staff training completion). No measures were rated \"not met.\"\n*   **Document No. 27: Travel**\n    *   Total travel expenditure increased significantly to $5.393 million in 2021-22 (from $1.579 million in 2020-21 and $1.699 million in 2019-20), primarily due to the 2022 federal election. The AEC adheres to the Whole of Australian Government Travel Policy.\n*   **Document No. 28.2: Indigenous voter services and engagement**\n    *   The AEC is committed to increasing First Nations electoral participation. The estimated national Indigenous enrolment rate reached 84.5% as of December 2022, a consistent increase from 74.7% in June 2017. Efforts include successful direct enrolment trials (adding ~15,500 First Nations people), targeted advertising campaigns, and the Indigenous Electoral Participation Program (partnerships, remote enrolment, culturally appropriate services). The AEC is also expanding remote polling services.\n*   **Document No. 36.2: Referendum Preparedness**\n    *   The AEC, as an independent statutory authority, is responsible solely for the \"machinery\" of a referendum (not the campaigns). With appropriate lead time and funding, the AEC is ready to conduct a referendum, with costs estimated to be similar to a federal election (e.g., the 2022 federal election was budgeted at approximately $420 million).\n*   **Document No. 37.2: COVID safety measures \u2013 2022 FE**\n    *   The AEC safely delivered the 2022 federal election with COVID-19 safety measures in place, adapting to the changing environment without a reported spike in cases attributable to the election. Planning adhered to existing legislation (which does not allow for 100% postal or electronic voting), with additional staff, vaccination requirements, and mask mandates for election workers.\n*   **Document No. 38: Early Voting**\n    *   Early voting continues to rise, with over 7.9 million early votes cast in the 2022 federal election (51.34% of total votes), up from 6.15 million (40.79%) in 2019. In-person early voting accounted for over 36% of all votes. Postal votes significantly increased to 2.39 million (from 1.29 million in 2019). Mobile polling services were reduced due to the pandemic.\n*   **Document No. 39: Postal Voting**\n    *   The AEC expresses confidence in the integrity of postal voting processes, which are governed by the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918. Legislative changes in 2021 modernized postal voting envelopes and allowed for the early extraction of ballot papers from declaration envelopes (from the Monday prior to election day) to speed up counting. In 2022, the AEC issued 2.73 million postal votes (an 87% return rate), with 79.2% of rejected postal votes due to missing elector or witness signatures.\n*   **Document No. 40: Mobile Polling \u2013 2022 Federal Election**\n    *   Mobile polling services were provided to remote areas, homeless shelters, a limited number of residential aged care facilities (RACFs), and some prisons. The decision to limit services to RACFs was based on health advice and risk assessments, requiring explicit agreement from facilities and adherence to strict COVID-19 safety measures.\n*   **Document No. 43.2: Overseas voting \u2013 2022 Federal Election**\n    *   COVID-19 and security concerns necessitated adjustments to overseas voting for the 2022 federal election. In-person voting was available at 19 overseas posts, while others relied on postal voting, supported by courier delivery to improve speed and reliability, and diplomatic mail for returns.\n*   **Document No. 44.2: Senate counting and assurance**\n    *   The AEC uses ballot paper scanning to capture Senate preferences for timely scrutiny. In the 2022 federal election, over 108 million preferences from more than 15.5 million ballot papers were scanned, data-entered, and verified in approximately four weeks. The process involves human verification, robust controls, and security assessments (including IRAP). An external company performs legislated on-site assurance (0.45% exception rate in 2022). Scrutineers can observe the process. The AEC confirmed it has not used Scytl software for any federal election.\n*   **Document No. 45: EasyCount \u2013 Senate**\n    *   \"EasyCount \u2013 Senate\" (ECS) is the AEC's software for distributing preferences in Senate elections. It is rigorously tested, secure, and enables reporting and auditing of results. New legislation will require an external assessor to verify ECS accuracy before the next federal election. The source code is not publicly released due to its commercial use for other elections.\n*   **Document No. 46: Polling Place Technology \u2013 ECLs**\n    *   Investment in polling place technology will increase the number of Electronic Certified Lists (ECLs) from 5,500 (used in 2022) to 10,000 for the next federal election. A new digital tool for polling place Officers in Charge is also being developed to enhance polling place management, integrate with the AEC Command Centre, and improve issue resolution, replacing current paper-based returns.\n*   **Document No. 47: Voter verification**\n    *   The AEC states that voter verification (requiring identification when casting a vote) is a matter for Parliament and would necessitate legislative change. The AEC warns of potential operational impacts, including increased queue times, higher costs for technology, materials, training, and staff, more time-consuming declaration votes, and the risk of disenfranchising eligible voters.\n*   **Document No. 48: Candidate qualification checklist**\n    *   The AEC is required to check that mandatory questions on the self-assessment qualification checklist are answered by candidates but does not determine the accuracy of the answers or candidates' eligibility, as this is a matter for the High Court. For the 2022 federal election, 1,624 checklists (totalling 17,117 pages) were published soon after nominations were declared.\n*   **Document No. 49: Commonwealth Procurement Rules \u2013 Environmental sustainability**\n    *   The AEC procures goods and services in line with Commonwealth Procurement Rules, which now explicitly require considering climate change impacts in value-for-money assessments. The AEC's practices include evaluating suppliers' environmental credentials, using recycled content, and recycling/donating end-of-life products. The document notes the challenge of measuring specific climate impacts for small items and balancing this with operational demands.\n*   **Document No. 50: Cowper Count \u2013 2022 Federal Election**\n    *   An administrative error occurred in the Cowper counting centre during the 2022 federal election, where some House of Representatives ballot papers were inadvertently combined across different pre-poll voting centre counts. The AEC confirmed this error did not impact the overall election results for the division and that all ballot papers were accounted for.\n*   **Document No. 51: Call Centre worker recordings**\n    *   Addresses social media allegations that AEC call centre staff provided false voting information during the election. The AEC stated it could not verify the authenticity of such isolated claims without reviewing hundreds of thousands of enquiries and asserted that its 105,000 temporary staff are trained and provided with accurate scripts.\n*   **Document No. 61: Referendums: YES/NO pamphlet and information campaigns**\n    *   No substantive content was provided in the released pages for this document.\n*   **Document No. 62: Election time public information campaign**\n    *   The AEC conducted a large-scale, multi-channel communication campaign for the 2022 federal election (with a $19 million media placement spend). The campaign aimed to inform and encourage voter participation, covering enrolment deadlines, early voting options, and how to correctly complete ballot papers. It also included \"Stop and Consider\" messaging against disinformation and information on COVID-19 safety measures, with content translated into 52 languages.\n*   **Document No. 68: Gilmore Count**\n    *   The AEC denied requests for a recount in the division of Gilmore following the 2022 federal election, made by the Liberal Party candidate. The Divisional Returning Officer and the Electoral Commissioner concluded that the scrutiny process was properly conducted and the margin of 373 votes did not warrant a recount, consistent with AEC policy (automatic recounts occur for margins less than 100 votes). No request was made to the Court of Disputed Returns.\n*   **Document No. 69: 2GB Discarded ballot papers found \u2013 Port Macquarie**\n    *   The AEC is investigating reports of discarded completed ballot papers found in a bin in Port Macquarie. Initial findings suggest these were likely declaration ballot papers that were not returned correctly by voters. The small number of papers indicates no impact on the election result, and no evidence points to an operational issue by the AEC.", "model": "gemini-2.5-flash", "generated_at": "2025-06-22T20:25:28.802034", "source_hash": "0832810c24a400e70088223949eb36c8eda16e2c0ab1fc49816f0f0a76b0be04", "raw_response_path": "data/llm_responses/LEX3715__overall__balanced__20250622T202528.json", "output_tokens": 3183, "prompt_tokens": 25128, "total_tokens": 34131, "summary_length": 13324}, "short_index": {"text": "Cory Harding's FOI request LEX3715 sought access to the AEC's \"finalised estimates briefing pack for the 2023 February Supplementary Budget Estimates,\" specifically from the Deputy Electoral Commissioner, Electoral Integrity and Operations, and Service Delivery.

Documents concerning the \"Australian Electoral Commission Budget,\" \"Cost of the 2022 Federal Election,\" \"First Nations Electoral Enrolment and engagement,\" \"Referendum Preparedness,\" \"COVID safety measures for electoral events,\" \"Foreign interference and electoral integrity,\" \"Electoral integrity and security,\" \"Misinformation and disinformation at the 2022 federal election,\" \"Physical security,\" \"Response to recent data breaches,\" and \"YES/NO pamphlet and information campaigns\" were largely withheld or provided in edited form. This lack of transparency severely limits the public's ability to scrutinize the functioning and integrity of a fundamental democratic institution, which is a direct contradiction of civil liberties and open government principles.\n    *   **Deviation:** Specifically, the refusal to make the source code for \"EasyCount \u2013 Senate,\" the software used for Senate preference distribution, public is a significant transparency issue. While the AEC cites commercial reasons, a progressive stance advocates for open-source and verifiable election technology to prevent manipulation and build public trust in the electoral process.\n\n2.  **Social Justice & Civil Liberties (Voter Access and Participation):**\n    *   **Alignment:** The documents reveal a strong commitment by the AEC to enhancing **First Nations electoral participation**. Significant funding (including $16.1 million specifically for First Nations enrolment and participation) has been allocated for preparatory work for the First Nations Voice to Parliament Referendum. The AEC actively works to address historically lower participation rates in remote communities, providing resources in First Nations languages, establishing community partnerships, employing Indigenous staff, and expanding remote polling services. The consistent increase in estimated Indigenous enrolment rates (from 74.7% in 2017 to 84.5% in December 2022) is a clear success story aligning with progressive values of equity and inclusion.\n    *   **Alignment:** The AEC's current policy and documented position **against mandatory voter identification at polling places** (Document 47) strongly aligns with progressive values. The AEC highlights that introducing such measures would increase queue times, costs, and disproportionately risk disenfranchising \"groups of eligible voters\" \u2013 a direct acknowledgment of the regressive impact of voter ID laws, which often target marginalized communities, students, and low-income individuals.\n    *   **Mixed:** Efforts to ensure accessibility through early voting, postal voting, and mobile polling for vulnerable groups (homeless shelters, prisons, aged care facilities) are positive. However, the *reduced* mobile polling and overseas in-person voting due to the pandemic (Document 38, 40, 43.2), while understandable in context, represents a temporary setback for universal accessibility. The high rate of rejected postal votes (140,124 in 2022, 79.2% due to missing signatures, Document 39) also highlights ongoing challenges in voter education or accessible completion methods that disproportionately impact certain demographics.\n\n3.  **Environmental Impact:**\n    *   **Alignment:** The explicit amendment to the Commonwealth Procurement Rules (effective July 2022) requiring the inclusion of \"climate change impacts\" in \"value for money assessment\" for procurements (Document 49) is a direct alignment with progressive environmental values, integrating sustainability into government operations.\n    *   **Mixed:** While the policy is a positive step, the AEC acknowledges the practical difficulties in implementing and measuring these impacts at a granular level, indicating that the policy's full transformative effect is still evolving.\n\n4.  **Wealth Distribution & Corporate Influence:**\n    *   **Mixed/Deviation (Potential):** The documents reveal \"ongoing challenges with the AEC\u2019s funding model\" (Document 24), leading to operating losses and posing \"significant risk\" to managing complex electoral events. Underfunding of a critical public service can lead to increased reliance on private contractors and outsourcing, potentially diverting public funds to private profits (Document 25, 39). While the documents state adherence to procurement rules, the lack of detailed transparency on specific contracts due to redactions and refusals makes it difficult to assess the extent of corporate influence.\n    *   **Deviation (Potential):** Concerns are raised regarding political parties making \"significant changes to the approved PVA artwork\" for postal vote applications and \"late engagement\" from major parties on online applications (Document 39). These issues, even if addressed by the AEC, highlight potential for external political influence or inefficiencies within what should be a neutral, publicly administered process.\n\nIn summary, while the AEC demonstrates commendable dedication to social justice through its proactive Indigenous engagement and its stance against voter ID laws, the significant lack of transparency regarding its budget, operations, security measures, and the use of proprietary software presents a notable deviation from core progressive values of open government and public accountability. The commitment to environmental sustainability in procurement is a positive policy alignment, but its practical implementation is still developing.", "model": "gemini-2.5-flash", "generated_at": "2025-06-22T20:26:16.522007", "source_hash": "0832810c24a400e70088223949eb36c8eda16e2c0ab1fc49816f0f0a76b0be04", "raw_response_path": "data/llm_responses/LEX3715__overall__left_leaning__20250622T202616.json", "output_tokens": 1109, "prompt_tokens": 25119, "total_tokens": 31351, "summary_length": 5958}, "short_index": {"text": "From a left-leaning perspective, the Australian Electoral Commission's FOI documents present a mixed picture: while demonstrating strong progressive alignment through its commendable dedication to increasing First Nations electoral participation and its principled opposition to restrictive mandatory voter ID laws, alongside positive strides in integrating climate considerations into procurement, significant deviations are evident. A pervasive and concerning lack of transparency is highlighted by extensive redactions and outright refusals concerning crucial budget details, security measures, and the continued use of opaque proprietary software like \"EasyCount,\" severely limiting public oversight and undermining trust in fundamental democratic processes.

A predominant theme throughout the documents is a significant lack of transparency, with numerous requests for access to key financial and operational data being refused or heavily redacted.\n\n**Fiscal Responsibility and Economic Efficiency:**\nThe documents raise serious questions about the AEC's financial management and the efficient allocation of taxpayer funds. Document 24 reveals the AEC reported a **$24.5 million loss** in 2021-22 and faces \"ongoing challenges\" and \"significant risk\" with its funding model, indicating a lack of fiscal discipline and potential operational unsustainability.\n\nSignificant expenditure is highlighted, such as **$75.1 million** over two years for preparatory work on the First Nations Voice to Parliament Referendum (Doc 22), with $50.2 million directly to the AEC for preparations and an *additional* $16.1 million specifically for \"First Nations enrolment and participation.\" This pre-emptive and targeted spending for a single event, alongside **$160 million** already in the Contingency Reserve, suggests potential overspending and a lack of restraint in discretionary government expenditure.\n\nTravel expenses (Doc 27) jumped from **$1.5-1.6 million** in non-election years to **$5.393 million** in 2021-22, and while some increase is expected, the justification includes \"networking with international partners and supporting reform agendas in other countries,\" which may be seen as mission creep beyond core electoral functions and potentially inefficient use of funds. The **$19 million** spent on the 2022 federal election public information campaign (Doc 62), including \"Stop and Consider (disinformation) messaging,\" also warrants scrutiny for its scale and scope, particularly given its **exemption from standard government advertising review processes**, which undermines accountability.\n\nThe documents also reveal the considerable cost of extensive COVID-19 safety measures, with an acknowledgment of \"spent costs\" if restrictions eased (Doc 37.2), raising concerns about proportionality and adaptability in spending during a dynamic environment.\n\n**Individual Liberty:**\nThe AEC's stance on **voter verification (ID)** is a notable deviation from a common conservative tenet (Doc 47). The AEC explicitly states that voter ID \"is not required\" by law and warns it would lead to \"increased costs,\" \"longer queue times,\" and potentially \"impact voter enfranchisement.\" This position prioritizes administrative ease over perceived security and integrity, which for conservatives, is a crucial element of safeguarding the individual's vote. The AEC's argument that voter ID \"does not eliminate the possibility of administrative errors\" is a weak justification against a measure widely seen as enhancing electoral integrity.\n\nConversely, the significant increase in **early and postal voting** (Doc 38), now comprising over 50% of votes, while presented as ensuring \"fair and equitable access,\" can be viewed as potentially diluting the traditional civic act of voting on a single election day, and its higher administrative cost (Doc 39) impacts efficiency. The AEC's targeted \"investments in partnerships and activities\" and \"targeted advertising campaigns\" for \"First Nations enrolment and participation\" (Doc 28.2), while aiming to increase participation, could be interpreted as government intervention designed to influence specific demographics, potentially overstepping the bounds of merely facilitating access for all.\n\n**National Security (Electoral Integrity):**\nThe documents reveal several areas of concern regarding the integrity of the electoral process, which is fundamental to national security. The **heavy reliance on postal voting** (Doc 39), which saw 2.7 million issued in 2022, comes with acknowledged \"resource intensive\" counting processes and vulnerabilities. The fact that political parties provided 61% of paper postal vote applications, some with \"significant changes to the approved PVA artwork\" or \"incorrect return address[es],\" raises red flags about external influence and potential for error. The rejection of **176,880 postal votes** (79.2% for lacking elector or witness signatures) indicates substantial issues in the process or voter compliance.\n\nAdministrative errors were also noted, such as the combining of ballot papers across different pre-poll counts in Cowper (Doc 50), which, while claimed to have \"no impact on the results,\" erodes public trust. The **denial of a recount request in Gilmore** despite a close margin (373 votes) and candidate concerns (Doc 68) can also fuel skepticism about the thoroughness of the counting process. The discovery of \"discarded ballot papers\" in Port Macquarie (Doc 69), even if initially attributed to voter error, highlights a lapse in ballot paper security and adds to integrity concerns.\n\nThe AEC's limited role in verifying **candidate qualifications** (Doc 48), treating the checklist as a \"self-assessment tool\" and deferring eligibility to the High Court, creates an \"honour system\" that can lead to costly post-election legal challenges and undermines the integrity of elected officials from the outset. Furthermore, allegations of **call centre staff providing false voting information** (Doc 51), while unverified by the AEC due to data limitations, underscore a critical integrity weakness in information dissemination.\n\nThe significant investment in **polling place technology (ECLs)** (Doc 46), costing $24.4 million, is aimed at preventing multiple voting, which aligns with integrity, but the cost-benefit of such technological solutions needs careful scrutiny. Similarly, the use of **scanning and software (EasyCount \u2013 Senate)** for Senate counting (Docs 44.2, 45), while efficient, relies on non-public source code for \"commercial capacity\" reasons, limiting full public scrutiny and potentially raising concerns about the transparency of the counting process itself.\n\n**Limited Government:**\nA core conservative principle is limited government intervention and high transparency. The overwhelming number of **refused or heavily redacted documents** in the initial FOI request (pages 1-10 of the FOI schedule), covering financial matters, procurements, and integrity, is a significant blow to transparency and accountability. This lack of openness impedes public oversight of government operations.\n\nThe AEC's involvement in a **\"Stop and Consider (disinformation) messaging\" campaign** (Doc 62) raises concerns about government overreach into influencing public discourse and potentially infringing on free speech, rather than strictly administering elections. The exemption of this campaign from standard government advertising review processes further exacerbates concerns about the lack of independent oversight. The explicit inclusion of \"climate change impacts\" into \"value for money\" assessments for procurements (Doc 49) signals an expansion of government policy into areas beyond its core electoral function, potentially leading to less efficient, politically driven spending rather than purely economic decisions.\n\nIn conclusion, these FOI documents, particularly through their extensive redactions and the details they do reveal, present a picture of an electoral commission grappling with significant financial challenges, making substantial and sometimes questionable expenditures, while exhibiting a concerning lack of transparency and a cautious stance on measures that could bolster electoral integrity like voter ID. This collectively points to deviations from core conservative principles of fiscal responsibility, economic efficiency, robust electoral integrity, and limited, transparent government.", "model": "gemini-2.5-flash", "generated_at": "2025-06-22T20:27:03.385577", "source_hash": "0832810c24a400e70088223949eb36c8eda16e2c0ab1fc49816f0f0a76b0be04", "raw_response_path": "data/llm_responses/LEX3715__overall__right_leaning__20250622T202703.json", "output_tokens": 1560, "prompt_tokens": 25119, "total_tokens": 31676, "summary_length": 8026}, "short_index": {"text": "The Australian Electoral Commission's (AEC) operations, as revealed through recent FOI documents, raise significant concerns for right-leaning principles, primarily due to a pervasive lack of transparency and apparent deviations from fiscal responsibility.

This includes critical information regarding the AEC's overall budget, the true cost of the 2022 federal election, details on procurement and major tenders, travel expenses, referendum preparedness, COVID safety measures, secure telephone voting, and crucial aspects of electoral integrity, security, foreign interference, misinformation, and data breaches. This widespread withholding of information immediately suggests an agency intent on shielding its operations and decision-making from public scrutiny, fostering distrust rather than transparency.\n\n**Financial Imprudence and Potential Waste:**\nThe AEC's financial health appears precarious, with \"ongoing challenges\" to its funding model and a significant swing from a $47.9 million surplus in 2020-21 to a $24.5 million loss in 2021-22. This volatile financial position is described as posing \"significant risk\" to managing future electoral events. Furthermore, substantial taxpayer funds are being allocated for a potential referendum even before it is confirmed or fully costed: $66.3 million for \"preparatory work\" and \"participation\" is *additional* to a vague $160 million already parked in the \"Contingency Reserve,\" raising concerns about pre-emptive overspending and potential waste. The admission of \"some spent costs\" on COVID safety measures that became unnecessary further highlights a lack of agile financial management.\n\n**Operational Deficiencies and Reduced Voter Access:**\nThe AEC's own performance statements reveal that nearly a quarter of its targets were only \"partly met,\" including the critical \"percentage of voters enrolled who turn out to vote.\" This points to fundamental inefficiencies in encouraging participation. There was a notable reduction in vital services for vulnerable populations during the 2022 election, with mobile polling not conducted at hospitals or independent living facilities, and overseas in-person voting severely curtailed, potentially disenfranchising segments of the electorate. The revelation that the AEC is only now investing $24.4 million to replace \"paper OIC Returns\" with digital tools underscores a long-standing reliance on inefficient, outdated processes.\n\n**Grave Concerns for Electoral Integrity and Accountability:**\nSeveral findings directly challenge the integrity and trustworthiness of the electoral process:\n*   **Software Secrecy:** The AEC's staunch refusal to release the source code for \"EasyCount \u2013 Senate,\" the software used for counting Senate preferences, is a glaring transparency issue. Without independent scrutiny of this critical software, the integrity of vote tabulation remains unverified and susceptible to suspicion.\n*   **Mass Voter Disenfranchisement:** A staggering 176,880 postal votes were rejected in the 2022 election, with 79.2% of these rejections due to technicalities like missing elector or witness signatures. This represents a significant number of legitimate votes discarded due to procedural hurdles, undermining the democratic right to vote.\n*   **Political Party Influence and Inefficiency:** The heavy reliance on political parties to distribute postal vote applications (61% of paper applications came from parties) led to critical issues. Parties made \"significant changes to the approved PVA artwork,\" failed to provide all artwork versions, and in some cases, delayed forwarding applications to the AEC for up to two weeks, causing \"double handling and delays\" and prompting \"many queries and complaints\" from voters. This blurs the line between party campaigning and official electoral processes, raising concerns about partisan interference and inefficiency.\n*   **Non-Verification of Candidate Eligibility:** The AEC explicitly states it \"does not determine the accuracy\" of information provided by candidates on their qualification checklists, merely checking if questions are answered. This effectively outsources the crucial task of verifying a candidate's eligibility to the candidates themselves, creating a clear loophole for unqualified individuals to run for office and potentially waste public resources on contested elections.\n*   **Ballot Handling Failures:** Despite the AEC's dismissive tone, the confirmed \"administrative error\" of mixing ballot papers across different counting centres in Cowper, and the alarming report of \"completed ballot papers\" being found discarded in a bin in Port Macquarie, highlight severe lapses in ballot security and chain-of-custody protocols. The AEC's attempts to deflect blame to voters or claim \"no impact\" are unconvincing given the seriousness of discarded votes.\n*   **Dismissal of Allegations:** Allegations of call centre staff providing \"false voting information\" were effectively dismissed by the AEC due to the sheer volume of calls, indicating an unwillingness or inability to properly investigate and ensure accurate information dissemination.\n*   **Unscrutinised Advertising Spend:** A $19 million public information campaign for the 2022 election operated under a \"long-standing exemption from the review and approval processes of government advertising campaigns.\" This lack of oversight for a significant public expenditure raises questions about the campaign's true purpose and effectiveness, especially given the \"partly met\" turnout rate.\n*   **Refusal of Recount:** The AEC's refusal to grant a recount in the close Gilmore division (a margin of 373 votes), despite specific concerns from a candidate regarding scrutineer access and informal vote assessment, further erodes confidence in the declared results, particularly when considered alongside other ballot handling issues.\n\nIn conclusion, these FOI documents reveal an AEC that prioritises secrecy and procedural rigidity over full transparency and democratic access. The patterns of financial challenges, operational shortcomings, and a troubling number of incidents impacting electoral integrity, compounded by the agency's defensive responses and information suppression, demand far greater scrutiny and accountability from the government.", "model": "gemini-2.5-flash", "generated_at": "2025-06-22T20:27:56.902716", "source_hash": "0832810c24a400e70088223949eb36c8eda16e2c0ab1fc49816f0f0a76b0be04", "raw_response_path": "data/llm_responses/LEX3715__overall__government_skeptic__20250622T202756.json", "output_tokens": 1214, "prompt_tokens": 25115, "total_tokens": 32837, "summary_length": 6442}, "short_index": {"text": "The released FOI documents paint a damning picture of the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) from a government skeptic's perspective, revealing an agency deeply committed to secrecy and exhibiting profound operational and financial mismanagement.

Financially, the AEC appears volatile and wasteful, swinging to a significant loss and pre-emptively allocating tens of millions for unconfirmed referendums while admitting to squandering funds on unnecessary COVID measures. Operationally, it curtailed vital voter access for vulnerable populations and remains reliant on outdated processes, contributing to nearly a quarter of its performance targets being unmet. Most alarmingly, its integrity is deeply compromised: the refusal to release its Senate counting software source code, the staggering disenfranchisement of almost 177,000 postal voters on technicalities, unchecked political party influence over voting applications, a failure to verify candidate eligibility, confirmed ballot handling failures including discarded votes, dismissal of call centre misconduct, and an unscrutinised $19 million advertising spend, all fundamentally erode public trust in the democratic process.

A recent Freedom of Information (FOI) request highlights the meticulous planning and transparent processes employed by the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) in fulfilling its crucial mandate.\n\n**Robust and Transparent Electoral Operations:**\nThe AEC's operations are consistently affirmed through an unmodified audit opinion, demonstrating sound financial management despite the fluctuating costs inherent in delivering major electoral events. The government proactively invests in strengthening the democratic process, as seen in the substantial allocation of funds for referendum preparedness, including significant investment in enhancing First Nations electoral participation. This commitment to inclusivity is yielding tangible results, with an encouraging and consistent increase in Indigenous enrolment rates, achieved through strategic partnerships, direct enrolment initiatives, and culturally appropriate services.\n\n**Adapting to Challenges and Ensuring Integrity:**\nThe 2022 federal election successfully navigated the complexities of the global pandemic, with the government demonstrating agile and responsible governance. Proactive legislative changes and meticulous contingency planning ensured the safe and fair delivery of the election without compromising public health, while strictly adhering to health authority advice. The rise in early and postal voting reflects the government's commitment to providing flexible and equitable access to democratic participation. Reforms in postal voting, including modernized processes and early ballot paper extraction, have significantly enhanced efficiency and voter confidence, with robust multi-layered verification processes safeguarding integrity.\n\n**Leveraging Technology and Upholding Accountability:**\nThe government is strategically investing in advanced polling place technology, such as the expanded use of Electronic Certified Lists (ECLs) and new digital tools for polling place management. This forward-thinking approach enhances efficiency, voter convenience, and electoral integrity, actively contributing to the prevention of multiple voting. The integrity of Senate vote counting is assured through rigorously tested and independently assessed software, combined with meticulous human oversight and transparent processes, with all data publicly available for scrutiny.

Allegations of misinformation are addressed through extensive staff training, clear guidelines, and engagement with relevant authorities, ensuring that the public receives accurate information. The transparent process for candidate qualification, requiring self-assessment and public disclosure, empowers both candidates and the electorate.\n\n**Sustainable and Ethical Procurement:**\nThe government is proactively embedding environmental sustainability into its procurement framework, with the AEC diligently applying updated Commonwealth Procurement Rules to ensure that climate change impacts are considered in value-for-money assessments. Practical efforts, such as the use of recycled materials and responsible end-of-life product management, demonstrate a dedication to sustainable operations while meeting the unique demands of electoral events.\n\nThe government's approach to electoral administration is characterized by continuous improvement, transparent accountability, and an unwavering dedication to serving the public interest, ensuring a robust, accessible, and secure democratic process for all Australians.", "model": "gemini-2.5-flash", "generated_at": "2025-06-22T20:28:42.841336", "source_hash": "0832810c24a400e70088223949eb36c8eda16e2c0ab1fc49816f0f0a76b0be04", "raw_response_path": "data/llm_responses/LEX3715__overall__government_apologist__20250622T202842.json", "output_tokens": 641, "prompt_tokens": 25119, "total_tokens": 31246, "summary_length": 4098}, "short_index": {"text": "The government's electoral administration, meticulously detailed in this FOI overview, underscores its unwavering commitment to robust governance and positive public outcomes.

The pervasive pattern of outright refusals and heavy redactions across almost all requested documents suggests a systematic cover-up of failures, vulnerabilities, and potentially questionable dealings.\n\n**Systemic Opacity and Information Suppression:**\n*   **Wholesale Concealment:** An astonishing number of documents \u2013 20 out of 34 listed \u2013 were either entirely refused or provided only as heavily edited copies. Crucial details regarding \"Australian Electoral Commission Budget\" (Doc 21) and \"Cost of the 2022 Federal Election\" (Doc 23) were entirely withheld, creating a black hole around the AEC's financial stewardship and the taxpayer cost of elections.\n*   **National Security and Integrity Cover-Up:** The complete refusal to release documents on \"Foreign interference and electoral integrity\" (Doc 63), \"Electoral integrity and security\" (Doc 64), \"Misinformation and disinformation at the 2022 federal election\" (Doc 65), and \"Response to recent data breaches\" (Doc 67) is an unconscionable attack on democratic transparency. It suggests either catastrophic failures in safeguarding elections against critical threats or a deliberate effort to keep the public uninformed about the true state of electoral security and vulnerabilities. The redaction codes, particularly \"Proper and efficient conduct of the operations of AEC\" (Code 23) and \"Tests, examinations or audits material\" (Code 21), are used as convenient shields to hide internal shortcomings.\n*   **Hiding Operational Failures:** Documents related to critical services like \"First Nations Electoral Enrolment and engagement\" (Doc 28.1), \"Referendum Preparedness\" (Doc 36.1), \"COVID safety measures\" (Doc 37.1), \"Secure Telephone voting\" (Doc 41), \"Residential aged care facilities\" (Doc 42), \"Overseas voting services\" (Doc 43.1), and \"Senate count and assurance\" (Doc 44.1) were all entirely withheld or heavily redacted. This suggests a desire to obscure significant operational weaknesses, inadequate provision of services to vulnerable voters, or failures in core electoral processes.\n\n**Financial Instability and Questionable Spending:**\n*   **Admitted Financial Precarity (Doc 24):** The AEC openly admits to \"ongoing challenges with the AEC\u2019s funding model\" and \"significant risk in managing increasingly complex electoral events.\" Reporting a staggering $24.5 million loss in 2021-22, following a surplus, highlights profound financial instability and a failure in basic fiscal forecasting, jeopardizing its ability to deliver fair elections. The \"unmodified audit opinion\" is a low bar, indicating only accurate record-keeping, not financial efficiency or responsibility.\n*   **Wasteful Preparatory Spending (Doc 22):** The allocation of \"$75.1 million over two years\" for \"preparatory work\" and \"$50.2 million\" directly to the AEC for a referendum that was not yet certain reveals a willingness to commit substantial public funds to speculative projects, potentially leading to significant wasted expenditure if the referendum does not proceed.\n*   **Excessive Travel Costs (Doc 27):** A 240% increase in travel expenses in an election year ($5.393M in 2021-22) compared to non-election years ($1.5-1.7M) suggests a severe lack of cost control and potentially lavish or unnecessary travel.\n\n**Operational Incompetence and Disenfranchisement:**\n*   **Failure in Indigenous Enrolment (Doc 28.2):** Despite self-congratulatory rhetoric of \"increasing over time\" and \"considerable work,\" a stark 10%+ gap persists between general and Indigenous enrolment rates, leaving nearly 87,000 First Nations people unenrolled. This persistent disparity highlights a systemic failure to achieve equitable electoral participation for Indigenous Australians, with vague claims of \"more resources\" and \"partnerships\" failing to mask the ongoing issue.\n*   **Postal Voting Fiasco (Doc 39):** The AEC's \"absolute confidence\" in postal voting integrity is shattered by its own data: a staggering 176,880 postal votes were *rejected* in 2022, primarily due to missing signatures. This represents a colossal failure in voter education, form design, or process clarity, leading to widespread disenfranchisement. The admission of \"late engagement\" and altered artwork by major political parties, and voters' complaints about ballots sent to parties rather than the AEC, expose a dangerous lack of control over a critical voting pathway, opening doors for potential manipulation and voter frustration.\n*   **Reduced Vulnerable Voter Access (Doc 40, 43.2):** The \"limited number\" of residential aged care facilities offered mobile polling and the complete exclusion of hospitals and independent living facilities from these services represent a significant, indefensible reduction in access for vulnerable populations during a pandemic. Similarly, the reduced \"overseas voting services\" (only 19 in-person posts) is an admitted downgrade from 2019, forcing citizens into less reliable voting methods and undermining the principle of universal access.\n*   **Questionable Senate Count Accuracy (Doc 44.2, 45):** The claimed 0.45% \"exception rate\" in Senate preference capture, when applied to 108 million preferences, translates to *486,000* potential errors \u2013 a staggering figure that casts severe doubt on the \"robust controls and validations\" and the overall accuracy of the count. The AEC's continued refusal to release the source code for its \"EasyCount \u2013 Senate\" software is a fundamental breach of transparency, preventing independent scrutiny and fostering public distrust in the integrity of election outcomes. The cryptic disclosure of purchasing software from controversial vendor Scytl, only to claim it was \"not used,\" is highly suspicious and raises questions about procurement waste or undisclosed issues.\n*   **Slow Technology Adoption (Doc 46):** A $24.4 million investment over four years to increase Electronic Certified Lists (ECLs) to only 10,000 by the *next* federal election, with a new digital tool for Officers in Charge limited to only 1,300 locations, demonstrates an incredibly slow and inefficient pace of modernization. This perpetuates reliance on outdated paper systems and implies that the AEC has been slow to address known vulnerabilities like multiple voting.\n*   **Voter Verification Apathy (Doc 47):** The AEC's passive, almost obstructionist stance on voter identification \u2013 deflecting responsibility to Parliament and highlighting only the \"impacts\" (increased costs, longer queues) while downplaying the benefits \u2013 signals a lack of commitment to bolstering public confidence in electoral integrity against issues like multiple voting.\n*   **Candidate Eligibility Farce (Doc 48):** The AEC explicitly abdicates responsibility for verifying candidate eligibility, treating the \"qualification checklist\" as a mere \"self-assessment tool.\" This critical loophole places the burden on candidates and the High Court, undermining preventative measures for electoral integrity. The inability to provide a timeframe for publishing these \"17,117 pages\" due to \"rigorous quality assurance\" is an absurd admission of administrative incompetence, compounded by the eventual removal of these documents from public access, hindering accountability.\n*   **Environmental Hypocrisy (Doc 49):** The AEC's passive and resistant response to new environmental procurement rules, complaining about the \"difficulty to identify the specific impact that supplying pencils\" has on climate change, highlights a profound lack of commitment to environmental responsibility and a bureaucratic aversion to adapting to modern governance standards.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe FOI response reveals an AEC that operates behind a veil of secrecy, selectively disclosing information while using vague justifications and bureaucratic platitudes to deflect from significant systemic issues. The extensive redactions, financial opacity, operational shortcomings leading to disenfranchisement, and a defensive stance against transparency measures combine to present an agency struggling with its core mandate, eroding public trust in Australia's electoral processes. This is not an agency inspiring confidence, but one seemingly in urgent need of radical reform and far greater independent oversight.", "model": "gemini-2.5-flash", "generated_at": "2025-06-22T20:30:05.992568", "source_hash": "0832810c24a400e70088223949eb36c8eda16e2c0ab1fc49816f0f0a76b0be04", "raw_response_path": "data/llm_responses/LEX3715__overall__highly_critical__20250622T203005.json", "output_tokens": 1764, "prompt_tokens": 25116, "total_tokens": 38035, "summary_length": 8514}, "short_index": {"text": "The Australian Electoral Commission (AEC), as revealed by these FOI documents, emerges as a monumentally opaque, fiscally irresponsible, and operationally incompetent entity, relentlessly prioritizing self-preservation and narrative control over transparent electoral integrity.
