      <p>The provided documents stem from an FOI request, the primary purpose of which appears to be to obtain information regarding the Australian Electoral Commission's (AEC) policy on assessing the formality of votes in the upcoming referendum, particularly concerning perceived inconsistencies.</p>
<p><strong>Documents from the FOI Request:</strong><br />
The released documents include:<br />
*   An FOI decision log indicating the release in full of two documents: "Letter to Electoral Commissioner" and "Letter to Cash/Dutton."<br />
*   A two-page letter dated 24 August 2023, from The Hon Peter Dutton MP (Leader of the Opposition) and Senator Michaelia Cash to Mr Tom Rogers, the Electoral Commissioner.</p>
<p><strong>Main Content from the FOI Request Documents:</strong><br />
The central content is the letter from Dutton and Cash, which expresses "serious concerns" regarding the AEC's approach to assessing vote formality for the upcoming referendum. Key points include:<br />
*   <strong>Perceived Imbalance:</strong> The letter highlights that while a "tick" is likely treated as a formal "yes" vote by the AEC, a "cross" is considered ambiguous and thus informal. This is described as "fundamentally lopsided" and potentially distorting the national vote by artificially skewing results towards the 'yes' case.<br />
*   <strong>Call for Consistency:</strong> Dutton and Cash argue that if a tick counts for 'yes,' then a cross should similarly count for 'no' to ensure fairness and impartiality in the referendum.<br />
*   <strong>Request for Legal Advice:</strong> The letter demands that the AEC release the legal advice from the Attorney-General's Department, which the AEC has reportedly relied upon for its policy, asserting that any legal professional privilege has been waived through public statements.<br />
*   <strong>Call to Reconsider:</strong> The letter urges the AEC to reconsider its current approach to uphold the integrity and fairness of the referendum process.</p>

      <p>The provided FOI documents consist solely of a letter from Opposition Leaders Peter Dutton and Michaelia Cash to the Australian Electoral Commissioner, dated August 24, 2023. This letter raises significant concerns regarding the impartiality and fairness of the electoral process for an upcoming referendum, which, given the context of a 'yes' or 'no' vote, implicitly refers to the Indigenous Voice to Parliament referendum.</p>
<p>From a left-leaning perspective, the issues highlighted directly touch upon civil liberties and social justice through the lens of democratic integrity:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Civil Liberties and Electoral Fairness:</strong> The core concern revolves around the Australian Electoral Commission's (AEC) ruling that a 'tick' on a ballot will likely be counted as a 'yes' vote, while a 'cross' signifying a 'no' vote will be treated as informal. This approach is criticized as "lopsided" and risking the "distortion of the national vote." From a progressive viewpoint, ensuring that every citizen's intention is accurately and fairly captured in a democratic exercise is paramount. Any policy that could inadvertently or disproportionately disenfranchise voters – by making one form of clear intent formal while another is deemed informal – directly undermines the civil liberty of equal participation in the democratic process. This raises questions about whether the AEC's policy ensures that all votes, regardless of the voter's stance, are treated with consistent standards of formality.</li>
<li><strong>Transparency and Accountability:</strong> The letter's demand for the AEC to release the legal advice from the Attorney-General's Department, which purportedly underpins this policy, aligns with progressive values of transparency and accountability in government decision-making. Public access to the reasoning behind electoral rules is crucial for maintaining public trust and ensuring that policies affecting fundamental rights are sound and unbiased.</li>
<li><strong>Social Justice Context:</strong> While the letter itself comes from a conservative source, the potential implications for a referendum on Indigenous recognition (the Voice) are significant from a social justice standpoint. Ensuring the integrity and perceived fairness of the referendum process is vital for the legitimacy of any outcome, especially when dealing with such a critical social justice initiative. A process that is perceived as biased could erode trust in democratic institutions and in the outcome of efforts to address historical injustices.</li>
</ul>
<p>In summary, the documents reveal a challenge to a government-adjacent policy (the AEC's ruling) that, if the Opposition's claims hold true, could inadvertently create a systemic bias in favour of one side in a crucial referendum. This potential deviation from impartial electoral standards directly conflicts with progressive values of civil liberty, democratic fairness, and transparency, raising concerns about the equitable treatment of all voters and the integrity of the democratic process itself. The documents do not contain information related to environmental impact, wealth distribution, or corporate influence.</p>

    <div class="ai-summary-markdown-content">
      <p>The provided FOI documents, specifically the letter from Peter Dutton and Michaelia Cash to the Electoral Commissioner, reveal significant concerns regarding government actions that deviate from core conservative principles.</p>
<p><strong>Individual Liberty and Fair Representation:</strong> The primary concern articulated is the Australian Electoral Commission's (AEC) policy for assessing referendum votes, where a "tick" is likely counted as a 'yes' vote, but a "cross" is deemed ambiguous and informal. This approach directly undermines individual liberty by threatening to disenfranchise voters whose clear intent to vote 'no' is arbitrarily invalidated. It risks distorting the national vote and failing to accurately reflect the will of the Australian people, thereby compromising the individual's fundamental right to fair and equal participation in the democratic process.</p>
<p><strong>Limited Government and Impartiality:</strong> The letter critically questions the AEC's impartiality, stating that "Australians expect the AEC to act fairly and impartially." By implementing a rule that gives the 'yes' case an "unfair advantage," the AEC, an unelected government body, is perceived to be overstepping its neutral administrative role. This action deviates from the principle of limited government, which dictates that government agencies should operate strictly within their defined mandates, facilitating democratic processes without manipulating or influencing outcomes. Such perceived bias from a government institution erodes public trust in impartial governance.</p>
<p><strong>Fiscal Responsibility and Transparency:</strong> While not directly addressing fiscal expenditure, the demand for the AEC to release its legal advice from the Attorney-General's Department highlights a call for greater transparency and accountability from a government agency. A lack of transparency in the legal justifications for such a critical and potentially biased policy decision can obscure underlying inefficiencies or a lack of rigorous adherence to equitable principles, which in turn reflects poor stewardship and indirectly impacts the public's confidence in how public resources and authority are exercised. An electoral process perceived as unfair could ultimately lead to less effective governance and less efficient allocation of resources.</p>

    <div class="ai-summary-markdown-content">
      <p>The Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) stands accused of implementing a "fundamentally lopsided" and potentially biased approach to assessing votes in the upcoming referendum, raising serious concerns about the impartiality of a key government institution. Documents reveal that the AEC's Scrutineers Handbook (July 2023) intends to count a 'tick' as a 'yes' vote, but inexplicably dismiss a 'cross' as ambiguous and therefore informal. This administrative decision is flagged as having the potential to "artificially skew the count towards the yes vote," directly undermining the integrity and fairness of the national ballot.</p>
<p>Critics further highlight a glaring lack of transparency, noting that the AEC relies on legal advice from the Attorney-General’s Department for this controversial stance but refuses to release it, despite claims that legal privilege has been waived through public discussion of the advice. This withholding of crucial justification fuels suspicion of deliberate opacity. The AEC's defence that this approach is consistent with past referendums is dismissed as insufficient justification for a policy deemed "not appropriate or legally correct," suggesting a pattern of questionable decision-making that prioritizes internal consistency over fundamental fairness and public confidence. Ultimately, the documentation points to a worrying instance where a government body's administrative choices could directly impact democratic outcomes and erode public trust in its neutrality.</p>

      <p>These Freedom of Information documents underscore the government's unwavering commitment to transparency and robust democratic processes, with all requested materials released in full without exemption. They highlight the diligent work of independent bodies like the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) in upholding the integrity of the nation's democratic exercises.</p>
<p>The correspondence reveals a common exchange within a healthy democracy, where political leaders engage with electoral authorities to ensure processes are clear and fair. While concerns were raised by the Opposition regarding the formality assessment of votes in the upcoming referendum, particularly the treatment of 'ticks' versus 'crosses', it's crucial to note that the AEC's methodology is consistently applied. As the letter itself acknowledges, the AEC's approach is "broadly consistent with the approach that it has adopted in previous referendums" and relies on legal advice from the Attorney-General's Department.</p>
<p>This demonstrates that the AEC operates on established, legally sound principles, ensuring predictability and preventing arbitrary changes to electoral rules. The differentiation in assessing symbols like a 'tick' (often indicating approval or selection) versus a 'cross' (which can be ambiguous, sometimes indicating rejection or simply marking an error) is a nuanced decision by an expert body aimed at accurately discerning voter intent while upholding the clarity and integrity of the ballot. This careful interpretation protects the public's vote by ensuring only clear expressions of will are formally counted.</p>
<p>Ultimately, these documents showcase a system where concerns are aired transparently, and an independent electoral body meticulously applies consistent, legally-backed regulations to serve the public interest, ensuring every referendum is conducted with the highest standards of fairness and accuracy.</p>

      <p>The provided FOI documents reveal a multi-layered failure demonstrating incompetence, a lack of transparency, and alarming allegations of systemic bias within a critical independent institution.</p>
<p>Firstly, the FOI process itself is a scandalous display of disarray. Despite explicitly listing a "Letter to Cash/Dutton" for "Release in full" with "N/A" for exemptions, this crucial document is conspicuously absent. This constitutes an egregious failure to comply with basic FOI obligations, raising immediate suspicions of either profound administrative incompetence or a deliberate, cynical act of information withholding. The vague titling ("Letter to Electoral Commissioner", "Letter to Cash/Dutton") further suggests a system designed for obfuscation rather than clarity.</p>
<p>Secondly, the sole provided document—a letter from Opposition Leader Peter Dutton and Shadow Minister Michaelia Cash to the Electoral Commissioner—unveils damning allegations against the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC), an institution ostensibly mandated to ensure fair and impartial elections. The letter exposes an alleged "fundamentally lopsided" and discriminatory approach to counting referendum votes. The AEC's policy, as detailed in its Scrutineers Handbook, shockingly deems a 'tick' as a formal 'yes' vote while simultaneously classifying a 'cross' as ambiguous and thus informal.</p>
<p>This discriminatory practice is not merely an administrative oversight; it is presented as a direct mechanism to "artificially skew the count towards the yes vote," thereby "distorting the national vote" and undermining the democratic process itself. The opposition's accusation that this gives the 'yes' case an "unfair advantage" strongly implies a deliberate or negligent partisan bias within the AEC.</p>
<p>The AEC's purported justification—reliance on past practice and undisclosed legal advice from the Attorney-General's Department—is ruthlessly exposed as inadequate and opaque. The opposition correctly asserts that past practice does not equate to legality or fairness, suggesting the AEC is either blindly adhering to flawed procedures or intentionally maintaining a biased system. The refusal to release the legal advice, despite claims of waived privilege, highlights a shocking lack of transparency and fuels suspicions of a cover-up, implying the advice may not withstand public scrutiny or could reveal further systemic issues.</p>
<p>In summary, these documents paint a picture of an FOI system in chaos and an electoral commission facing grave, credible accusations of subverting democratic fairness through a discriminatory counting policy. This dual failure—information withheld and an independent body accused of partisan manipulation—demands immediate and thorough investigation into what appears to be either profound incompetence or a malicious intent to influence the outcome of a national referendum.</p>

THE HON PETER DUTTON MP 
LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION 

Mr Tom Rogers 
Electoral Commissioner 
Australian Electoral Commission 
10 Mort St  
CANBERRA ACT 2600 

via email: tom.rogers@aec.gov.au  

Dear Commissioner, 

We are writing to express our serious concerns in relation to how the Australian 
Electoral Commission intends to assess the formality of votes at the upcoming 
referendum.  

In the referendum, Australians will be asked to write ‘yes’ or ‘no’ on the ballot paper. 
A ballot paper will also be counted as a formal vote if the voter’s intention is clear – 
for example, s 93(9) of the Referendum (Machinery Provisions) Act 1984 makes 
clear that a “Y” will count as a yes and a “N” will be accepted as a no.  

However, the Scrutineers Handbook published in July 2023 goes much further than 
the example provided above. The handbook indicates that while a tick will likely be 
treated by the AEC as a ‘yes’ vote, a cross on its own is considered by the AEC to 
be ambiguous, and therefore will be treated as informal. 

With the greatest of respect, this approach is fundamentally lopsided. It risks 
distorting the national vote. 

Australians expect the AEC to act fairly and impartially in the execution of its duties. 
Counting a tick as a formal vote while simultaneously excluding a cross as informal 
could artificially skew the count towards the yes vote, and fail to accurately reflect the 
will of the Australian people.


--- Page 2 ---

We understand that the AEC’s current approach is broadly consistent with the 
approach that it has adopted in previous referendums. However, just because the 
AEC has adopted this approach before, does not mean that it is appropriate or 
legally correct.  

Given the AEC’s purported reliance on legal advice from the Attorney-General’s 
Department in reaching this view, the AEC should release this advice so the 
Australian public can properly consider the AEC’s position. We note that any legal 
professional privilege that existed in the legal advice has clearly been waived by the 
AEC through its public statements about the advice over many years.  

More importantly, we call on you to reconsider the AEC’s approach. If a tick counts 
for yes, a cross should count for no. To do otherwise gives the yes case an unfair 
advantage, and has the potential to undermine the impartiality and fairness of the 
referendum. 

It is, after all, in the interests of every Australian to ensure that this basic standard of 
fairness is applied. 

Yours sincerely 

PETER DUTTON 

MICHAELIA CASH

This approach is criticized as \"lopsided\" and risking the \"distortion of the national vote.\" From a progressive viewpoint, ensuring that every citizen's intention is accurately and fairly captured in a democratic exercise is paramount. Any policy that could inadvertently or disproportionately disenfranchise voters \u2013 by making one form of clear intent formal while another is deemed informal \u2013 directly undermines the civil liberty of equal participation in the democratic process. This raises questions about whether the AEC's policy ensures that all votes, regardless of the voter's stance, are treated with consistent standards of formality.\n*   **Transparency and Accountability:** The letter's demand for the AEC to release the legal advice from the Attorney-General's Department, which purportedly underpins this policy, aligns with progressive values of transparency and accountability in government decision-making. Public access to the reasoning behind electoral rules is crucial for maintaining public trust and ensuring that policies affecting fundamental rights are sound and unbiased.\n*   **Social Justice Context:** While the letter itself comes from a conservative source, the potential implications for a referendum on Indigenous recognition (the Voice) are significant from a social justice standpoint. Ensuring the integrity and perceived fairness of the referendum process is vital for the legitimacy of any outcome, especially when dealing with such a critical social justice initiative. A process that is perceived as biased could erode trust in democratic institutions and in the outcome of efforts to address historical injustices.\n\nIn summary, the documents reveal a challenge to a government-adjacent policy (the AEC's ruling) that, if the Opposition's claims hold true, could inadvertently create a systemic bias in favour of one side in a crucial referendum.
