      <p>The FOI request (No. LEX2846) sought comprehensive documentation related to the Australian Electoral Commission's (AEC) response to the COVID-19 pandemic concerning electoral processes. Specifically, it requested:<br />
*   Drafts of legislation, explanatory material, policy papers, and briefs related to the development of the COVID Enfranchisement Bill and Regulations.<br />
*   Advice provided to AEC social media and call-centre staff on assisting COVID-positive voters.<br />
*   Policy documents concerning the use of postal voting for COVID-positive voters.<br />
*   A list of files from the AEC's record management systems containing "COVID", "COVID-19", "coronavirus", or "pandemic".</p>
<p>The released documents include:<br />
*   An Australian Electoral Commission submission to the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters (JSCEM) from November 2020.<br />
*   Draft Commonwealth Electoral (COVID Enfranchisement) Regulations 2022.<br />
*   A "Customer Journey" draft (version 7) outlining a proposed voting experience for COVID-isolating customers, dated March 2022.<br />
*   Various internal documents providing talking points, key messages, and contact centre scripts for AEC staff regarding secure telephone voting for COVID-19 affected voters, dated between March and May 2022.<br />
*   The AEC's Postal Voting policy, dated February 2022.<br />
*   A list of relevant files from the AEC's record management system.</p>
<h3>Main Content from FOI Request Documents:</h3>
<p><strong>1. COVID Enfranchisement Legislation &amp; Telephone Voting:</strong><br />
*   The <strong>Commonwealth Electoral (COVID Enfranchisement) Regulations 2022</strong> were drafted to establish a secure telephone voting method for "coronavirus affected individuals." This measure was proposed for federal elections, allowing voters who test positive for COVID-19 and are directed to self-isolate/quarantine to cast their vote by phone if they cannot attend a polling place.<br />
*   <strong>Eligibility</strong> requires an individual to be registered, on an approved electoral roll, not have already voted, and to have become COVID-affected within a specific narrow timeframe (e.g., from 6:01 pm four days before polling day) under a public health order preventing their attendance at a polling place.<br />
*   The <strong>Customer Journey draft</strong> details a two-step process: <strong>Registration</strong>, where voters register online or by phone providing personal details and evidence of their positive test (e.g., reference/serial number from a health authority) to receive a unique registration number and PIN; and <strong>Voting</strong>, where they call a dedicated line, quote their registration number and PIN (for anonymity), and verbally instruct an operator on how to mark their ballot.<br />
*   The <strong>Staff Talking Points</strong> and <strong>Contact Centre Scripts</strong> emphasize that this is an "emergency measure only" and anticipate "long wait times." They provide guidance on proof of COVID-19 status, registration and voting hours, and strongly encourage voters to view ballot paper images online beforehand to expedite calls.</p>
<p><strong>2. Postal Voting for COVID-Positive Voters:</strong><br />
*   The <strong>Postal Voting policy (February 2022)</strong> outlines the general framework for postal votes, which can be utilized by individuals unable to attend a polling place due to serious illness or infirmity, a category that can include COVID-positive voters.<br />
*   A note within the policy confirms that "mobile polling facilities may not be provided" to nursing homes and hospitals due to the COVID-19 pandemic, suggesting increased reliance on postal voting for these vulnerable groups.<br />
*   <strong>Staff Talking Points</strong> advised COVID-positive individuals who tested positive earlier than the telephone voting eligibility cut-off to apply for a postal vote, also addressing concerns like securing a witness while isolating.</p>
<p><strong>3. General Election Administration &amp; COVID Impact:</strong><br />
*   The <strong>JSCEM Submission (November 2020)</strong> highlights the AEC's need for greater legislative flexibility (amendments to the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918) to manage elections during emergencies. This includes granting the Electoral Commissioner powers to determine electoral processes and to adjourn or suspend polling.<br />
*   The submission outlines significant <strong>logistical and financial impacts</strong> of conducting elections during the pandemic, drawing lessons from the Eden-Monaro by-election (2020). These include:<br />
    *   Nearly doubling the cost of the by-election due to COVID-19 prevention measures.<br />
    *   Estimating a 30% increase in polling staff and over $30 million in additional costs for a federal election due to hygiene, social distancing, and PPE.<br />
    *   Challenges with staffing availability, supply chains for materials (e.g., PPE), and managing voter turnout.<br />
    *   Changes in voting trends, with a significant increase in postal and pre-poll votes.<br />
*   The <strong>Staff Talking Points</strong> and <strong>Contact Centre Scripts</strong> detail the <strong>COVID-Safe measures</strong> implemented at in-person polling places, such as controlling venue capacity, providing hand sanitiser, regular cleaning of surfaces, managing queues, appointing hygiene officers, and encouraging voters to bring their own pencils.<br />
*   For transparency and integrity, all AEC staff involved in the telephone voting service are required to be Australian Public Service employees and sign political neutrality declarations. Scrutineers are permitted to observe the process (with voter consent for call listening), and stringent ballot paper handling and reconciliation procedures are maintained. The AEC also provides an email for complaints related to the phone voting service.<br />
*   The <strong>List of Files</strong> indicates the broad scope of internal AEC documentation and planning in response to the pandemic, covering operational, policy, and safety aspects.</p>

      <p>These FOI documents reveal the Australian Electoral Commission's (AEC) efforts to navigate the complexities of conducting federal elections during the COVID-19 pandemic, highlighting both commendable actions to uphold democratic participation and areas where systemic limitations or policy choices diverge from progressive values.</p>
<p><strong>Social Justice and Civil Liberties (Voting Access):</strong><br />
The AEC demonstrated a commitment to enfranchisement, which aligns with progressive values of universal suffrage. The core "COVID Enfranchisement Regulations" and associated policies were emergency measures designed to allow COVID-positive individuals to vote, primarily through a secure telephone voting service. This expanded access, alongside provisions for postal voting and mobile polling (initially suspended then adapted for aged care), aimed to prevent widespread disenfranchisement due to public health orders. Positive steps include the provision of assistance for voters with disabilities (e.g., blind/low vision telephone voting), the inclusion of telephone interpreter services, and communication materials available in 33 languages, demonstrating an intent to reach diverse communities. The commitment to allowing voters still in the phone queue at closing time to cast their vote also aligns with preventing arbitrary exclusion.</p>
<p>However, several deviations from progressive ideals of equitable access are evident. The telephone voting service, while crucial, was narrow in scope, limited to those <em>diagnosed</em> with COVID-19 after a specific cutoff, excluding close contacts or those with symptoms who might still be hesitant to vote in person. The reliance on voters to register online for phone voting and to view ballot paper images digitally introduces a digital literacy and access barrier. The requirement for voters to provide "evidence" of their COVID-positive status, including retaining reference/serial numbers for tests for 40 days, places an administrative burden on individuals who are ill or otherwise vulnerable. The continued emphasis on compulsory voting, even for ill individuals, shifts the onus onto sick citizens to justify non-voting, rather than ensuring frictionless access. Furthermore, the explicit rejection of broader online voting for federal elections, regardless of personal circumstances, represents a missed opportunity for modernizing and permanently enhancing accessibility, contrasting with calls for more flexible and secure digital democratic participation. Significant barriers also remained for overseas electors, with low postal vote admission rates highlighted in the Eden-Monaro by-election.</p>
<p><strong>Environmental Impact:</strong><br />
The documents implicitly reveal a deviation from environmental sustainability. The implementation of COVID-safe election practices necessitated a substantial increase in single-use items, including "130,000 single-use half-size pencils," "disinfectant wipes," and "disposable gloves" for the Eden-Monaro by-election alone. Extrapolated to a federal election, this would lead to millions of additional waste items, conflicting with progressive environmental goals of waste reduction and sustainable resource use.</p>
<p><strong>Wealth Distribution and Corporate Influence:</strong><br />
The documents show a significant financial impact of conducting elections during a pandemic. The Eden-Monaro by-election costs almost doubled to $3.954 million, with an estimated "30 per cent increase in polling staff required, costing approximately an additional $13 million" and over "$30 million" for PPE and other prevention materials for a full federal election. This reallocation of public funds, while necessary for health safety, points to the economic strain of maintaining democratic processes under crisis conditions.</p>
<p>A key concern from a progressive standpoint is the reliance on private contractors for critical electoral infrastructure. "Computershare (CCS)" is explicitly named as the AEC's "PVA scanning and PVP mail house services contractor," handling postal vote applications and dispatch. While the AEC mentions "strict business and quality rules," the outsourcing of such fundamental components of election administration to a private corporation raises questions about potential corporate influence, transparency, and accountability, as well as the potential for profiteering from a public service. The document also notes that the cost of "normal election materials is impacted by the pandemic, where either the materials themselves, or components to make them are often sourced overseas," highlighting global supply chain vulnerabilities and a lack of domestic production for essential electoral supplies, further intertwining corporate interests with the democratic process.</p>
<p><strong>Overall Alignment/Deviation:</strong><br />
The AEC's actions, as revealed in these documents, largely represent a reactive and temporary response to a crisis, prioritizing the immediate maintenance of the electoral process under duress. While efforts to ensure enfranchisement for COVID-affected individuals align with core social justice values, the solutions often create new administrative burdens or highlight existing systemic rigidities (e.g., legislative constraints preventing more agile or comprehensive digital voting options). The significant cost increases and reliance on private contractors for core services, coupled with the environmental impact of single-use items, deviate from progressive aspirations for efficient, publicly-controlled, and environmentally sustainable democratic systems. The temporary nature of the "COVID Enfranchisement Regulations" (repealed end of 2022) suggests a reluctance to embed these emergency innovations as permanent, more broadly accessible civil liberties.</p>

      <p>The Freedom of Information (FOI) documents reveal significant government actions and policy adjustments during the COVID-19 pandemic that present both alignments with and deviations from conservative principles, particularly concerning economic efficiency, individual liberty, fiscal responsibility, and limited government.</p>
<p><strong>Economic Efficiency:</strong><br />
The documents highlight a substantial decline in economic efficiency in election administration due to pandemic-related measures. The Eden-Monaro by-election saw its cost almost double to $3.954 million, attributed to additional polling locations, increased staffing for sanitization and queue control, personal protective equipment (PPE), and new communication and training packages. Projections for a federal election indicated an estimated 30% increase in polling staff ($13 million additional cost) and over $30 million for specialized COVID-19 prevention materials. Operational efficiency also suffered, with vote issuing processes taking 46% longer. The establishment of a large-scale telephone voting service, while aiming for enfranchisement, inherently introduces logistical complexities and acknowledged "long wait times," indicating an inefficient use of resources and voter time, even with a projected 7,000 operators. These measures represent a significant deviation from principles of economic efficiency, driven by an expansion of services under emergency conditions.</p>
<p><strong>Individual Liberty:</strong><br />
The documents show a complex relationship with individual liberty. On one hand, efforts were made to ensure all eligible citizens could exercise their right to vote, including those in isolation, by introducing secure telephone voting and expanding postal voting options. This <em>supports</em> the fundamental liberty of democratic participation. However, the implementation introduces new restrictions and burdens. Telephone voting eligibility was narrow, requiring individuals to have tested positive <em>after</em> a specific cutoff time and to provide health authority reference numbers for their positive tests. This collection of personal health data and the requirement for specific declarations, backed by penalties for false information, can be viewed as an increased encroachment on individual privacy and a bureaucratic burden. The continued enforcement of compulsory voting, even with the added complexities of pandemic-era voting methods and potential long wait times, subtly prioritizes state mandate over ease of individual choice, leading to a tension with the principle of individual liberty.</p>
<p><strong>National Security:</strong><br />
The documents implicitly touch on national security through the emphasis on maintaining the integrity and public confidence in federal elections, even during an emergency. The Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) explicitly states its commitment to "safeguard democracy" and deliver "high integrity elections." The introduction of secure telephone voting, with measures like PINs, registration numbers, and scrutineer oversight (with an option for voters to opt-out of observation), aims to protect the secrecy and validity of the vote. However, the shift away from traditional in-person voting to a system relying on remote operators and digital registration, even with safeguards, could raise long-term concerns about system vulnerability and public trust in the electoral process, which are critical to national stability and security.</p>
<p><strong>Fiscal Responsibility:</strong><br />
The extensive costs detailed for adapting election processes to the pandemic explicitly demonstrate a significant deviation from fiscal responsibility. The doubling of by-election costs and multi-million dollar projections for a federal election underline a readiness to incur substantial taxpayer expense to maintain voting access during a crisis. The allowance for "reasonable and practicable" alternative postal vote delivery methods at a cost of up to $100 per elector, while ensuring enfranchisement, points to a willingness to expand spending without strict adherence to cost-effectiveness. This reflects a reactive rather than a fiscally conservative approach to unforeseen circumstances.</p>
<p><strong>Limited Government:</strong><br />
The documents reveal a marked expansion of government power and reach. The AEC's submission explicitly requests broader powers for the Electoral Commissioner, including the ability to determine how electoral processes are undertaken, and to adjourn or suspend polling and other election requirements. While framed as necessary "flexibility" for emergency situations, this grant of discretionary authority to an unelected official represents a notable deviation from the principle of limited government and separation of powers. The rapid establishment of a large-scale, government-run telephone voting operation (utilizing other Commonwealth department call centres and thousands of government employees) for a "temporary" emergency measure further illustrates an expansion of bureaucratic footprint and direct government intervention in civic processes. The Minister's power to specify additional matters for telephone voting eligibility also concentrates power, potentially allowing for political considerations to influence what should be an impartial administrative process.</p>

    <div class="ai-summary-markdown-content">
      <p>The FOI documents reveal a government electoral body, the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC), that embraced a reactive and exceptionally costly approach to managing elections during the COVID-19 pandemic, raising significant questions about fiscal responsibility, transparency, and the integrity of the voting process.</p>
<p>Central to these concerns is the <strong>"COVID Enfranchisement Bill and Regulations"</strong> which introduced a "secure telephone voting" method. While framed as an emergency measure (and indeed set to be repealed at the end of 2022), its implementation demonstrates a severe lack of foresight and a concerning shift in control. The regulations grant the Electoral Commissioner broad powers to "determine how certain electoral processes and activities may be undertaken" and "adjourn or suspend polling," effectively allowing for a top-down modification of established electoral law without direct parliamentary oversight for each decision.</p>
<p>The <strong>telephone voting system</strong>, in particular, stands out as a questionable expenditure and a potential compromise to voting integrity:<br />
*   <strong>Massive Cost &amp; Inefficiency:</strong> Despite being billed as an "emergency measure," the AEC projected an "estimated 30 per cent increase in polling staff required, costing approximately an additional $13 million," purely for staffing due to COVID-19 measures. Furthermore, procuring specialized PPE alone was estimated to "raise the cost of running a federal election by in excess of $30 million." The system required "approximately 7000 operators" for a service the AEC admitted would likely result in "long wait times." This suggests a colossal outlay of taxpayer money for a service acknowledged to be cumbersome and potentially frustrating for voters.<br />
*   <strong>Questionable Integrity &amp; Lack of Transparency:</strong> The "Customer Journey" document reveals a system where a call center operator "records the voter’s preference on the ballot papers." This removes the physical act of voting from the elector, introducing a third-party intermediary into the casting of a secret ballot. Critically, while "scrutineers" (party observers) could "listen to a call between a voter and a call centre operator," the regulations explicitly state that "An audio recording must not be made of a request to vote by a secure telephone vote or of a vote by a secure telephone vote." This deliberate omission of audio records, even when observers are present, is a glaring red flag for accountability and independent verification of vote accuracy. Additionally, the limitation that scrutineers cannot exceed the number of operators further restricts oversight.<br />
*   <strong>Arbitrary and Shifting Eligibility:</strong> The eligibility for telephone voting was tightly restricted – only for those testing positive <em>after</em> a specific date (initially 6pm Tuesday 17 May, then expanded to Friday 13 May) <em>and</em> unable to attend a polling place. The social media guidance highlights the reactive nature of these changes, stating "If this changes today there will be public communications to advise the detail." This last-minute policy shift likely caused confusion and potentially disenfranchised voters who tested positive earlier or whose isolation dates didn't perfectly align. The AEC's own communications acknowledge, "No online voting for federal elections is available, regardless of personal circumstances," making the operator-mediated phone system appear as an unnecessary, costly, and less secure substitute for a more direct digital solution if one were genuinely needed.</p>
<p>The <strong>Eden-Monaro by-election</strong> serves as a stark precursor to these nationwide issues. The AEC's submission indicates the by-election's cost "almost doubling the total cost, to $3.954 million" from an average of $2 million, primarily due to "additional polling locations... additional staff required for sanitising, queue control and vote issuing and counting; PPE and other hygiene materials and services." Yet, turnout only saw a "slight drop" from 93.31% to 89.13%, raising the question of whether such a disproportionate financial outlay was genuinely necessary or efficient for maintaining participation. The AEC's internal data modeling for queue times also suggests that "even in times of emergency and crisis," their preference is for "evidence-based staffing estimations that prioritise safety and the efficient flow of voters," implying that the staffing increases were a planned response to a perceived (rather than empirically proven) need for additional staff to manage COVID-related process slowdowns.</p>
<p>Finally, the <strong>Postal Voting policy</strong> reveals a subtle shift in responsibility and accessibility for vulnerable groups. It notes that "mobile polling facilities may not be provided during the election period" for locations like "nursing homes, hospitals, high-care facilities, mining camps, prisons," directing these vulnerable populations to postal voting instead. This offloads the burden of access onto these individuals, potentially leading to further disenfranchisement, especially given the complexities and delays associated with postal votes during a pandemic.</p>
<p>In summary, the documents paint a picture of an AEC given expanded emergency powers, which it then used to implement a highly expensive, complex, and potentially opaque telephone voting system. This system, while intended to address pandemic-related voting challenges, appears to have prioritized a heavily staffed, operator-driven approach over more transparent or cost-effective digital alternatives, all while quietly shifting the burden of accessibility onto vulnerable voters and undermining public trust through a lack of critical audit trails.</p>

    <div class="ai-summary-markdown-content">
      <p>The released FOI documents highlight the Australian government's exemplary commitment to upholding democratic principles and serving the public good, even amidst the unprecedented challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic. These documents demonstrate a proactive, adaptive, and transparent approach to ensuring accessible, secure, and safe electoral processes.</p>
<p>Key efforts and outcomes include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Proactive Legislative Adaptation and Emergency Preparedness:</strong> Recognizing the inherent difficulties in administering elections during emergencies, the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) proactively advised the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters (JSCEM) on necessary legislative amendments. The proposed changes, now formalized in the <em>Commonwealth Electoral (COVID Enfranchisement) Regulations 2022</em>, provide the Electoral Commissioner with essential flexibility to manage electoral processes (e.g., expanding postal or electronic voting, adjusting polling hours) while prioritizing voter and staff safety and maintaining public confidence. These regulations are designed as temporary measures, demonstrating a responsible and targeted response to the emergency, with safeguards like parliamentary scrutiny.</li>
<li><strong>Successful Piloting and Learning from Experience:</strong> The Eden-Monaro by-election served as a crucial test case, showcasing the AEC's agility and professionalism in a dual-emergency environment (bushfires and COVID-19). Post-election surveys revealed high voter and staff satisfaction with safety measures, validating the government's adaptive strategies. Key learnings from this event, such as the necessity of extensive inter-agency consultation (with Chief Medical Officers, police, health authorities) and the impact of health measures on operational costs, directly informed the planning for the federal election, ensuring continuous improvement and robust readiness.</li>
<li><strong>Enhanced Accessibility and Voter Enfranchisement:</strong> To ensure all eligible citizens could exercise their right to vote, the government implemented a multi-faceted approach. This included expanding the availability of pre-poll voting centres, dedicating teams to support vulnerable populations in aged care and hospitals, and, critically, introducing a secure telephone voting service for COVID-19 positive individuals unable to attend polling places. This service, clearly outlined in the "Customer Journey" document and the regulations, ensured anonymity while maintaining the integrity of the vote through stringent registration and verification processes. Measures for non-English speakers and those with disabilities were also prioritized, reflecting a commitment to inclusive participation.</li>
<li><strong>Robust Communication and Transparency:</strong> The government deployed comprehensive public information campaigns and clear communication strategies to inform voters about their options, new safety measures, and potential operational adjustments (e.g., longer wait times for emergency services). Detailed talking points and call centre scripts illustrate a consistent and reassuring message, designed to reduce voter anxiety and guide citizens through new processes, including how to provide proof of COVID-19 status for telephone voting. This proactive communication minimized confusion and maximized public awareness.</li>
<li><strong>Unwavering Commitment to Electoral Integrity and Safety:</strong> At every step, stringent measures were implemented to safeguard the integrity of the electoral process. This included real-time checks to prevent double voting, a two-step registration and voting process for telephone votes to ensure anonymity, and robust ballot paper handling and reconciliation procedures. Increased staffing at polling places, alongside the provision of PPE and enhanced hygiene protocols, underscored a paramount focus on public health. While these measures incurred additional costs (e.g., $30 million for PPE, increased staffing), they were deemed essential investments to protect lives and maintain trust in the democratic process, distinguishing Australia's approach from less successful international examples.</li>
<li><strong>Comprehensive Operational Planning:</strong> The extensive list of COVID-related files demonstrates the sheer breadth and depth of the government's planning, covering strategic management, occupational health and safety, communications, staffing, training, and technological development. The detailed Postal Voting policy further illustrates a meticulously planned approach to one of the most widely used alternative voting methods, including provisions for secure processing, timely delivery, and handling of special cases like silent electors.</li>
</ul>
<p>In summary, these documents provide compelling evidence of the government's diligent, adaptable, and public-focused response to an unprecedented crisis, ensuring the fundamental right to vote was protected with integrity and safety for all Australians.</p>

      <p>The following summary adopts a highly critical stance, meticulously dissecting the provided FOI documents to expose systemic failures, incompetence, and potential malice in the government's handling of electoral processes during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p><strong>I. Systemic Failure &amp; Gross Incompetence in Emergency Preparedness (AEC Submission to JSCEM, November 2020):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Profound Lack of Foresight:</strong> Despite acknowledging federal elections as Australia's "biggest peacetime logistical event," the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) was catastrophically unprepared for a foreseeable pandemic. Their November 2020 submission, almost a year into the global crisis, is a desperate plea for legislative changes that should have been proactively sought years prior, or at minimum, immediately after the pandemic's onset.</li>
<li><strong>Blame Shifting and Evasion of Responsibility:</strong> The AEC consistently externalizes blame, citing a "complex environment" and reliance on "ministers and senior officials across governments." This abdication of leadership demonstrates a failure to secure autonomy or assert the criticality of electoral functions within government.</li>
<li><strong>Pre-existing Failures Amplified:</strong> The document admits "existing challenges" like difficulty recruiting temporary staff, supply chain vulnerabilities, limited premises, and inadequate access for disabled, overseas, regional, homeless, and Indigenous voters were merely "exacerbated" by COVID-19. This is a damning confession that fundamental electoral integrity and accessibility were compromised <em>before</em> the pandemic, with COVID-19 simply revealing the depth of these long-standing systemic inequities.</li>
<li><strong>Legislative Inflexibility &amp; Delayed Action:</strong> The AEC's belated request for powers to "extend reasons electors can postal or pre-poll vote," "conduct an election solely by postal vote," or "expand categories of electors who may utilise the electronic (telephone) voting method" is a stark admission of its own reactive, rather than proactive, stance. The existing powers (Sections 240A, 241, 242) for suspending polling were deemed insufficient, highlighting a stunning lack of comprehensive legislative review or foresight in preparing for emergencies beyond simple "anthrax scares." Their inability to leverage broader existing powers (Section 286) due to internal constraints further underscores their organizational paralysis.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>II. Disenfranchisement, Financial Mismanagement, and Operational Chaos (Eden-Monaro By-election Analysis, AEC Submission):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Disenfranchisement of Vulnerable Voters:</strong> The "decision not to conduct mobile polling for the event," forcing aged care facilities and hospitals onto postal voting, is a direct act of disenfranchisement. The abysmal "9 per cent of postal votes sent to overseas electors were admitted to the count" (compared to 33% previously) is irrefutable evidence of a catastrophic failure to ensure access for a specific, often geographically isolated, demographic.</li>
<li><strong>Explosive Cost Overruns:</strong> The by-election's cost "almost doubling to $3.954 million" due to "additional polling locations... additional staff... PPE and other hygiene materials" exposes gross financial mismanagement stemming from reactive, inefficient planning. The pre-emptive warning that the "likely impact on the federal election budget is clear" and that "specialised materials... raise the cost... in excess of $30 million" forebodes continued taxpayer waste.</li>
<li><strong>Spin Over Substance:</strong> The claim that the AEC "aimed to reduce voter anxiety... by showing the AEC was prepared" is a transparent attempt at public relations spin to mask fundamental unpreparedness. "Awareness of the environmental context was key to the campaign’s success" prioritizes perception over actual operational effectiveness.</li>
<li><strong>Rushed &amp; Inadequate Training:</strong> The need to "adapt quickly to develop and deliver appropriate and relevant training" in "only three weeks" highlights a last-minute scramble, suggesting the training was likely superficial and insufficient, compromising the integrity of the process.</li>
<li><strong>Inefficient Operations &amp; Unacceptable Wait Times:</strong> Data revealing the "ordinary vote issuing process took 16.5 seconds (or 46 per cent) longer" points to severe inefficiency. The queue modelling exposing potential "maximum queue" times of "55.42 minutes" reveals an electoral system utterly incapable of maintaining acceptable service levels without exorbitant increases in staffing and resources, which itself incurs "an estimated 30 per cent increase in polling staff required, costing approximately an additional $13 million."</li>
<li><strong>Fundamental Logistical Failures:</strong> Admissions of "procurement lead times," "supply chain risks," and "significant challenges for bulk storage availability" reveal a complete lack of basic logistical foresight and planning for essential election materials.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>III. Bureaucratic Hurdles &amp; Undermined Secrecy in Telephone Voting (Customer Journey, Regulations, Call Centre Scripts):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Delayed, Restrictive, &amp; Arbitrary Access:</strong> The "DRAFT v7" of the "Customer Journey" in March 2022, just months before the election, indicates a protracted and incompetent development process. The "Commonwealth Electoral (COVID Enfranchisement) Regulations 2022," undated in the final version but appearing in 2022, were clearly a last-minute legislative scramble.<ul>
<li>The narrow eligibility window for telephone voting – "after 6pm Tuesday 17 May" then abruptly changed to "after 6pm Friday 13 May" days before the election – created deliberate confusion and limited access for genuinely sick voters.</li>
<li>The requirement for sick voters to provide highly specific proof ("test centre location, date, time, and ref # from your health authority" or "RAT brand and serial number") placed an unreasonable and discriminatory burden on individuals already suffering from illness.</li>
<li>The Ministerial power to "specify matters" for eligibility introduces political influence into what should be an independent electoral process.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Legalized Disenfranchisement &amp; Self-Protection:</strong> Regulation 7(1) explicitly states that the AEC is only required to provide telephone voting "to the extent feasible," and Crucially, 7(4) declares "Any failure to provide a telephone voting method... does not invalidate the result of a general election." This is a cynical legal shield designed to insulate the government and AEC from accountability for systemic failures and voter disenfranchisement.</li>
<li><strong>Erosion of Secret Ballot &amp; Voter Agency:</strong> The telephone voting process, where a "Service Officer records the voter’s preference on the ballot papers," fundamentally compromises the secret ballot and removes direct voter agency. The reliance on a third-party transcriber introduces potential for error, bias, or even malicious manipulation, with only a weak "read back" safeguard. The declaration that "it is irrelevant that the voter did not complete the ballot paper personally" (Reg. 24(2)(c)) legalizes this profound breach of democratic principle.</li>
<li><strong>Misleading Public Statements:</strong> The "Key Messaging" and "Call Centre Scripts" falsely claim, "The AEC voting assistant will not know the voter’s name and address" and "Phone operators are not given your name, address, or phone number. They are only given registration numbers, to protect your privacy." This directly contradicts Regulation 23(1)(a), which requires the Divisional Returning Officer to "find the name of the voter that corresponds to the registration number on the envelope" for scrutiny. This deliberate obfuscation of the process demonstrates a willingness to mislead the public about the true extent of anonymity.</li>
<li><strong>Inadequate Capacity &amp; Blame-Shifting for Delays:</strong> The call centre scripts repeatedly justify "lengthy wait times" by stating "it’s busy" and "This is an emergency service, and it’s busy." This is an admission of woefully inadequate resourcing for a compulsory voting system. The passive aggressive suggestion that voters "should be prepared for potentially long wait times" places the burden of inconvenience and potential disenfranchisement directly onto the sick citizen.</li>
<li><strong>Punishing the Ill &amp; Helpers:</strong> The regulations create an "offence for false or misleading declaration" (Reg. 26), effectively criminalizing honest mistakes by sick individuals. Furthermore, the penalty for an individual who "assists the voter" without the voter explicitly stating they "require another individual’s assistance" (Reg. 15(2)) actively deters much-needed support for vulnerable voters. The "strict liability" offense for voting more than once (Reg. 27(3)) further criminalizes potentially confused or disoriented sick individuals.</li>
<li><strong>Flawed Scrutiny and Lack of Transparency:</strong> Regulations limiting scrutineers to the "number of call centre operators" (Reg. 20(2)) and criminalizing communication not "reasonably necessary" (Reg. 20(6)) severely curtail effective oversight. The contradictory statement that "An audio recording must not be made... of a vote" (Reg. 16(8)) undermines any claim of transparency or the ability for scrutineers to verify vote accuracy.</li>
<li><strong>Abrupt Service Closures &amp; Lack of Cohesion:</strong> The internal memos show critical changes to registration eligibility and online portal closures happening just days before the election, indicative of a chaotic and uncoordinated rollout that actively hindered voter access.</li>
</ul>
<p>In conclusion, these documents paint a damning picture of a government and its electoral body exhibiting systemic unpreparedness, reactive and incompetent decision-making, and a callous disregard for voter accessibility, particularly for vulnerable populations during a public health crisis. The measures implemented were often too late, too limited, unnecessarily burdensome, and characterized by a disturbing lack of transparency and a focus on legal self-preservation over democratic integrity. The financial implications highlight significant waste due to these fundamental failures in foresight and execution.</p>

    <div class="ai-summary-markdown-content">
      <p>The provided documents reveal a disturbing expansion of government control and a clear disregard for individual liberty under the guise of "emergency measures." From an Objectivist perspective, this represents a dangerous slide towards collectivism, eroding the primacy of individual rights, rational self-interest, and productive achievement.</p>
<p><strong>Primacy of Individual Rights and Individual Liberty:</strong><br />
The most flagrant violation of individual rights is the explicit and repeatedly stated policy of <strong>compulsory voting</strong>. The state compels individuals to participate in an activity under threat of penalty, regardless of their personal values, rational assessment of candidates, or desire to abstain. This is forced altruism, demanding a "duty" to the collective that supersedes individual choice.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the "COVID Enfranchisement" regulations impose egregious infringements on personal autonomy. To vote by telephone, individuals are <em>forced</em> to <strong>disclose private medical information</strong> (positive COVID-19 test results, isolation directives, and associated reference numbers) to a government agency (AEC) as a prerequisite for exercising their right to vote. They are even required to "keep records" of this private health data for 40 days. This is a blatant overreach into an individual's private life, treating personal health status as a public commodity to be monitored and controlled by the state. The arbitrary and constantly shifting eligibility timelines for telephone voting (e.g., "tested positive after 6pm Tuesday 17 May") further demonstrate bureaucratic caprice, restricting rather than facilitating genuine individual choice.</p>
<p>The limitation of scrutineers at call centres to "one per call centre operator" significantly curtails the transparency essential for a free and fair electoral process. This undermines the individual's right to observe, fostering an environment where government actions can occur with reduced public oversight.</p>
<p><strong>Rational Self-Interest and Productive Achievement:</strong><br />
The "emergency measures" detailed in the documents lead directly to inefficiency and a suppression of productive achievement. The AEC's admission of "potentially long wait times" for telephone voting and the acknowledgment of "frustration" for callers highlight the inefficiency of a centrally planned, government-mandated service. Rational individuals seek to minimize wasted time and effort; these policies compel the opposite.</p>
<p>The significant financial burden imposed on taxpayers is another direct assault on rational self-interest. The Eden-Monaro by-election cost nearly double previous averages due to COVID measures, and federal election estimates include an additional $13 million for polling staff and over $30 million for PPE. These are costs extracted from the productive members of society to fund an inefficient, bureaucratic apparatus. This massive expenditure for "safety" measures, such as "sneeze shields," single-use pencils, and "Hygiene Officers," is a gross misallocation of resources that productive individuals could have invested more wisely for their own benefit.</p>
<p>The general reluctance to embrace readily available, efficient technologies, such as secure online voting, signifies a suppression of personal initiative and a preference for archaic, bureaucratically controlled methods. Despite public demand and the availability of technology, the AEC insists that "no online voting for federal elections is available, regardless of personal circumstances," forcing citizens into less efficient, state-approved channels.</p>
<p><strong>Dangers of Collectivism and Government Overreach:</strong><br />
The entire "COVID Enfranchisement Bill and Regulations" package is a prime example of collectivist thought in action. The justification for these measures consistently revolves around ensuring "confidence and trust in elections," "the safety of voters and electoral officials," and the "legitimacy of the result"—all collective values prioritized over individual freedom and autonomy.</p>
<p>The proposed legislative amendments, such as enabling the Electoral Commissioner to "determine how certain electoral processes...may be undertaken" and to "adjourn or suspend polling, or provide for the temporary suspension or adjournment of other events," centralize immense power in the hands of a single bureaucratic entity. This is textbook government overreach, allowing an unelected official to dictate fundamental aspects of the electoral process, including "close of rolls, nominations, early voting or scrutiny," thereby eroding the rule of law and individual control over political participation.</p>
<p>The pervasive coordination with "Commonwealth, state or territory government agencies" and the emphasis on "conforming with federal and local health advice" illustrate a government that views individuals as components of a collective to be managed, rather than sovereign entities. The detailed micromanagement of polling places, including mandates on queue control, hand sanitizer usage, and even the type of pencil used, exemplifies a "nanny state" mentality that dictates even the most trivial aspects of individual conduct.</p>
<p>In summary, these FOI documents lay bare an electoral system that has, under the pretext of a public health emergency, aggressively expanded its bureaucratic interference, compelled citizen action, and imposed arbitrary restrictions on individual liberty. The emphasis on collective "safety" and "integrity" has come at the expense of rational self-interest, productive achievement, and the fundamental right of individuals to live free from unwarranted government intrusion. This represents a dangerous and un-Objectivist trajectory where the state assumes ever-greater power over the lives of its citizens.</p>

Introduction 

The Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) welcomes the opportunity to make this 
submission to the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters (the Committee) inquiry on 
the future conduct of elections operating during times of emergency situations. 

A federal election is perhaps the biggest peacetime logistical event in Australia, and 
continues to grow in scale and complexity. There are currently over 16 million Australians 
enrolled to vote, and the federal election dates are not known in advance. Once the writs are 
issued, the AEC mobilises to identify suitable polling staff, venues, and all supporting 
logistical arrangements to administer the event.  

Emergency situations are inherently difficult to predict and are typically associated with high 
levels of uncertainty about either their cause or the scope and severity of their impacts.  An 
emergency situation has the potential to affect more than one jurisdiction, impact the 
community, and create pressure for resources when there is competing demand.  

The Australian federal electoral system may be vulnerable to emergency situations in 
circumstances where key components of the election are disrupted, including voting, election 
administration and campaigning. The timing and location of an emergency situation will 
influence the required adjustments to administration and the mitigation strategies which are 
used.  

There are a number of key limitations in the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 (Electoral 
Act) that could constrain the AEC’s ability to respond to circumstances requiring suspension 
or disruption to components of election delivery, including at polling places.  

This submission highlights requirements for Parliament’s consideration that would assist the 
AEC in continuing to deliver high integrity federal elections through various emergency 
scenarios at the national, state, or regional level.  

To this end, the AEC considers the following amendments to legislation are advisable in 
order to provide the AEC with greater flexibility to respond to emergency situations: 

  Enabling the Electoral Commissioner to determine how certain electoral processes 
and activities may be undertaken, where these processes or activities are impacted 
by an emergency situation 

  Providing the Electoral Commissioner with the authority to make a decision to 

adjourn or suspend polling, or provide for the temporary suspension or adjournment 
of other events.

Administering elections in 
emergency situations  

Building confidence and trust in elections is as complex as it has ever been. The AEC is 
committed to ensuring Australia’s elections are conducted in a manner that inspires and 
sustains confidence of the public, and election stakeholders.  

An enduring challenge in the electoral environment during ordinary times is maintaining a 
mutual understanding amongst electoral stakeholders of the shared responsibilities and 
accountabilities in a number of areas, including maintaining voters’ trust in elections and 
ensuring proactive actions are being taken to meet reasonable expectations around flexibility 
and responsiveness while providing for electoral integrity. 

Election planning and delivery in an emergency situation involves new stakeholders with 
their own remits and additional complexities. A more flexible legislative framework would 
provide the AEC with greater flexibility to respond to emergencies and their impact on the 
public and election stakeholders. 

The complex environment  

External guidance 

Most emergency situations will involve a declaration under Commonwealth, state or territory 
law. Those charged with managing an emergency situation and its consequences have 
pressing priorities related to their respective remits around preservation and protection of 
life, health, property and essential services. 

During any emergency situation, the AEC is only one stakeholder in a complex environment. 
Management of an election during an emergency situation requires engagement with 
ministers and senior officials across governments as well as advisory bodies. The specific 
stakeholders and their respective roles and responsibilities are dependent on the nature and 
severity of the emergency situation, and can evolve as the situation changes.  

A challenge with delivering a federal electoral event in a state or territory with a declared 
emergency will be conducting the event consistently with state or territory emergency 
requirements. While the constitutional position is that a state or territory law should not 
prevent a Commonwealth agency or a person from carrying out their responsibilities under 
Commonwealth law, it will nevertheless be important to work with local authorities to ensure 
electoral events are conducted consistently with local emergency requirements so that 
electors, staff and others in an election are not put at risk.  

A critical feature of the successful delivery of the Eden-Monaro by-election in the COVID-19 
environment was the significant investment of time required, and the immense value 
obtained, from engaging with government departments across jurisdictions before and 

Page 3


--- Page 5 ---

during the by-election. In delivering the by-election the AEC liaised closely with the 
Commonwealth Chief Medical Officer and the NSW Department of Health, emergency 
services, the Electoral Integrity Assurance Taskforce and political participants. A similar 
model of consultation is in train for the Groom by-election.  

The AEC’s emergency situation response requires a streamlined approach to access key 
stakeholders, such as police, fire and emergency services, Chief Medical Officers, Defence 
and central security agencies. 

Key logistical challenges 

Emergencies can pose major logistical difficulties that could force significant compromises, 
delays, or even render an election partially or fully undeliverable.  

Staffing: The delivery of elections is reliant on huge temporary workforces who in an 
emergency situation may be less available. At a federal election the AEC relies on a 
temporary workforce of approximately 90,000 people. Recruitment of temporary workers is 
increasingly challenging in normal circumstances and an emergency situation could 
suddenly pose significant recruitment and absenteeism challenges that could threaten the 
delivery of the election. This is amplified in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic where 
additional staff will be required to perform hygiene and sanitisation duties, manage queues 
and maintain voting service levels. 

Materials and logistics: Supply chains are also likely to be affected depending on the scale 
of the emergency. The rapid outbreak of COVID-19 resulted in global shortages of personal 
protective equipment (PPE) and lockdowns affected the transportation industry resulting in 
the slower delivery of food and other supplies. In these circumstances, the supply of 
essential items for an election could become difficult or unattainable.   

Turnout: Limitations on the movement and concentration of electors together with the risks 
of casualties during an emergency situation (for example, a natural disaster) can impact 
voter turnout at an election and the legitimacy of the result. 

Premises: An election relies on the availability, at short notice, of thousands of premises to 
conduct voting and for counting centres. An emergency situation may reduce the availability 
or suitability of premises or reduce the willingness of venue owners to hire to the AEC.   

Service suppliers: The AEC partners with external service providers to facilitate aspects of 
the election. Any impact to these major suppliers would have significant flow-on effects to 
the running of an election event – for example in the preparation and dispatch of postal 
votes, scanning and data capture of Senate ballot papers, printing of ballot papers, 
preparation of paper and electronic certified lists, etcetera. 

Exacerbated existing challenges: Conducting an electoral event during an emergency 
situation will exacerbate existing election delivery challenges including: 

  access to electoral services by electors: 

o  with disability 
o 
o 

living or travelling overseas 
located in regional and remote areas 

Page 4


--- Page 6 ---

o  experiencing homelessness 

 

 

the impacts of increasing number of electors voting early 

reliability and timeliness of postal services 

  provision of services to electors in Indigenous communities. 

Arrangements for a federal election commence immediately following the previous one, with 
approach and policy decisions required early in order to implement required contracts, 
materials and plans in advance of the earliest possible election date. Changes to an election 
delivery model will be shaped by election delivery options at that time.  

Business Continuity 
The AEC already has planned contingencies in place that position it to respond to significant 
business disruption during the election period as part of its business continuity planning 
arrangements. 

Proposals that allow for greater flexibility in the way in which the AEC might respond to 
emergency situations will strengthen the AEC’s ability to effectively respond to and mitigate 
business disruptions caused by such emergencies.

Proposed areas of legislation for 
consideration of amendment   

The prescriptive nature of the Electoral Act provides limited flexibility for how an election can 
be conducted. For example, the Electoral Act provides few exceptions to the requirement for 
physical attendance when voting, and those exceptions (for example, postal or telephone 
voting) may not be available to all or scalable in an emergency situation.  

Temporary modification 

To provide greater flexibility in the event of an emergency situation, the Electoral Act could 
be modified, for example, to: 

  extend the reasons electors can postal or pre-poll vote 

  conduct an election solely by postal vote (in some or all geographic areas) 

  streamline application and/or declaration requirements for postal voting and pre-poll 

voting 

  expand categories of electors who may utilise the electronic (telephone) voting 

method 

  extend operating or polling hours, and/or 

  conduct scrutiny more safely.  

Any modifications to the Electoral Act would only be possible for federal electoral events 
conducted in a state or territory or a geographic area of Australia where there is a declared 
emergency.    

Given the timeframes prescribed in the Electoral Act for conducting federal electoral events 
(from as little as 33 days), it is recommend that the authority to make emergency 
modifications:  

  may be exercised when there is a local or national emergency situation declared (or 

other public direction or determination made by a Minister in relation to an 
emergency’s effects on an election) under Commonwealth, state or territory law  

 

 

is limited to the extent necessary to conduct an electoral event in the circumstances 

is exercised by the Electoral Commissioner and cannot be delegated to others 

  must be exercised by prescribing the modification in an instrument that will be tabled 

in Parliament 

 

is time limited, for example available only for the necessary time to respond to the 
emergency situation and its impact, or conduct the electoral event. 

To exercise the authority to make emergency modifications the Electoral Commissioner 
would have regard to the following matters: 

 

the election is conducted in a manner that inspires trust and sustains public 
confidence 

Page 6


--- Page 8 ---

 

 

the need to ensure the safety of voters and electoral officials 

the election process and release of results occur in a timely manner.  

Practically, the exercise of any authority will be shaped by the time and operational 
environment of the given situation, and election delivery options available at that time. 

The exercise of this authority would be subject to Parliamentary scrutiny in the same manner 
as the conduct of federal elections is reviewed in detail by the Joint Standing Committee on 
Electoral Maters. 

The temporary nature of the modification means the electoral system remains unchanged 
once the emergency situation has passed. 

Adjournment and temporary suspension 

Sections 240A, 241 and 242 of the Electoral Act provide for the temporary suspension of 
polling and adjournment of polling (to another day) in certain circumstances. These sections 
do not provide for flexibility in who may make a decision to adjourn or suspend polling, or 
provide for the temporary suspension or adjournment of other election requirements, for 
example where an emergency may affect close of rolls, nominations, early voting or scrutiny.  

The AEC recommends that Parliament consider broadening the powers in sections 240A, 
241 and 242 as follows: 

  The power to adjourn polling is given to the Electoral Commissioner rather than 
presiding officer, with the Electoral Commissioner having power to delegate this 
responsibility to other officers as he or she considers appropriate. 

  The power to suspend polling be retained for presiding officers, and explicitly 

extended to officers in charge of pre-poll voting centres. 

  Broaden these powers or establish a new power for the Electoral Commissioner to 

suspend or adjourn other electoral processes during the election period, for example 
where an emergency may affect the process such as close of rolls, nominations, 
early voting or scrutiny. 

Existing provisions  
The following are areas where the Electoral Act does provide limited flexibility should an 
issue arise shortly before or on polling day.  

The most recent update to these provisions occurred in 2004, when following 
recommendation of the AEC and the Committee, section 240A was inserted and section 241 
was amended to cover incidents such as a bomb threat, health hazard (the examples 
provided to the Committee by the AEC at the time included ‘an anthrax scare’ or ‘dangerous 
animal’), fire or fire alarms or sprinklers being set off.  

Temporary suspension of polling (s240A) 
Section 240A gives presiding officers the power to temporarily suspend polling at their 
polling place for physical or voter safety reasons. The section provides riots, storms, fires, 
and health hazards as specific examples. 

Page 7


--- Page 9 ---

This power only allows suspension of polling that has already commenced, and only allows 
for suspensions until later the same day. 

At the 2019 federal election, polling at the Sydney Central pre-poll voting centre (PPVC) at 
Central Railway Station, Haymarket, was temporarily suspended after a bag was left 
unattended in the vicinity of the premises. Police attended promptly and polling resumed 
approximately fifteen minutes later. 

Adjournment of polling (s241) 
Section 241 gives presiding officers the power to adjourn polling at their polling place for 
physical or voter safety reasons. Like section 240A, section 241 provides riots, storms, fires, 
and health hazards as specific examples. 

This power only allows for adjournment of polling from one day to the next. For an 
adjournment to continue indefinitely, the presiding officer would need to repeatedly adjourn 
polling each day.  

At the 2019 federal election polling at the Crows Nest PPVC (NSW), a person died outside 
the PPVC shortly after voting. Polling was adjourned to the following day. 

Adjournment of polling in other cases (s242) 
Section 242 gives presiding officers the general power to adjourn polling if, for any cause, a 
polling booth at a polling place is not opened on polling day. 

This power only allows for adjournment for up to 21 days. 

Extension of time for holding an election (s286) 

Section 286 gives ‘the person causing the writ to be issued’ (that is, depending on the 
electoral event involved, either the Governor-General, a state Governor, or the Speaker of 
the House of Representatives) the broad power to extend the time for holding an election in 
order for ‘meeting any difficulty which might otherwise interfere’ with the election. 

This power has rarely been used and, whilst broad, is not held by any AEC officer. For these 
reasons it is unlikely that the AEC can utilise this power at short notice.

Responding to the COVID-19 
pandemic 

The proposals to amend legislation outlined earlier in the submission are intended to apply 
to the inherent unknowns of most conceivable emergency situations.  

This said, the COVID-19 pandemic is an example of an emergency situation that, should the 
AEC’s proposals be legislated in a sufficiently swift manner, would allow the Electoral 
Commissioner to adopt modified arrangements for a future election or by-election that could 
improve the accessibility and safety of an election that takes place during pandemics. 

The COVID-19 pandemic is a highly unusual and unique emergency situation in that while its 
impacts are evident and highly relevant to the conduct of an election, its length of duration is 
unknown. The pandemic may be with us for some time yet and its impacts for even longer.  

The AEC’s experience in the delivery of the by-election in the Division of Eden-Monaro 
provided a sense of considerations that may apply to a federal election conducted during the 
pandemic.  

There are also numerous recent examples of adaptation of election laws and processes to 
the impacts of COVID-19 nationally and internationally. Some examples are outlined at 
Attachment A. 

Eden-Monaro by-election 

The AEC demonstrated its agility and professionalism in delivering the Eden-Monaro by-
election in the aftermath of the 2019/20 bushfire season and the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Surveys conducted following the election of both voters and the temporary election 
workforce highlighted their satisfaction with the voting service and safety measures 
implemented.  

The Eden-Monaro by-election held on 4 July 2020 was the first federal electoral event to be 
held during a pandemic in 100 years and one of the first electoral events held in Australia 
during the COVID-19 pandemic. As such the Eden-Monaro by-election provides an 
opportunity to analyse the implications COVID-19 may have for future electoral events, 
including the federal election. 

The AEC set out its commitment to delivering the Eden-Monaro by-election to ensure the 
integrity of electoral services and participation, and to protect the welfare of voters, staff and 
other participants in the COVID-19 pandemic environment in the Eden-Monaro by-election 
Service Plan, which is provided at Attachment B. 

The AEC conducted the by-election in accordance with the Electoral Act which provides for 
in-person voting and postal voting (subject to an application). There was no legislated 

Page 9


--- Page 11 ---

alternative open to the AEC. However, in evaluating the viability of options (such as 100 per 
cent postal voting, use of electronic voting options or expansion of telephone voting), it was 
clear that the business process in each case would require significant review and adjustment 
in order to facilitate the possibility of using these options. That is, the AEC would not simply 
need the flexibility to expand or contract the various voting services, but also the flexibility to 
change components of the process to facilitate an expansion of that scale, and the 
necessary lead time in which to do that. 

Consultation: Delivering a by-election in the COVID-19 environment, in an area already 
impacted by a natural disaster, required close consultation with a great number of 
stakeholders, including Commonwealth and state government agencies.  

The breadth and depth of stakeholder consultation and liaison required to run the by-election 
was not only fundamentally important, but required significant time and resources. The AEC 
had to work extremely hard, be flexible and agile to establish an acceptable way for voters to 
participate safely. 

Examples of some of the unprecedented consultation and coordination undertaken within the 
compressed timeframes of an election included: 

  working with the Commonwealth Chief Medical Officer, NSW Chief Health Officer 
and ACT Chief Medical Officer and their respective Departments, as well as the 
Australian Federal Police and NSW Police, to determine rapidly evolving 
Commonwealth, state and territory laws and health restrictions and determine 
appropriate safety measures to conduct the by-election during the pandemic 

  seeking approval from the NSW Minister for Health to be able to hold the by-election  

  hosting a walk-through by the Commonwealth health advisor of the counting centre 
used for the by-election and a polling place mock-up, to demonstrate COVID-safety 
measures in place 

  seeking approval from the Secretary of the NSW Department of Education for 

schools to be used as polling booths 

  seeking assistance from the NSW Minister for Local Government to work with local 

councils regarding the use of facilities as polling places  

  working with the NSW Police Commissioner and NSW Police in relation to the 

activities permitted by the Electoral Act around distribution of how-to-vote material 
and the role of scrutineers, and the AEC approach to implementing the by-election 

 

 

 

liaison with the National Bushfire Recovery Agency and Resilience NSW to facilitate 
access to networks involved in supporting bushfire impacted communities 

liaison with Services Australia, which supported the AEC in areas affected by the 
bushfires by providing information from the AEC to clients affected by the bushfires, 
and  

liaison with the Chief Executive of Australia Post to ensure there would be no 
disruption to the delivery of postal votes. 

This high-level activity was supported and arrangements implemented by significant levels of 
officer-level liaison and coordination. 

Communication: The pandemic has been an incredibly stressful time for the community. 
The AEC aimed to reduce voter anxiety in our communications campaign by showing the 
AEC was prepared. The AEC’s expanded communication campaign included information 

Page 10


--- Page 12 ---

concerning COVID-19 safety measures, with ‘Plan your vote’ as the key message. Public 
awareness survey results indicated: 

  at least 85 per cent of respondents were aware of the health measures in place 

  all measures made at least three-quarters of respondents feel safer 

  nearly all respondents who voted at voting centres were satisfied with the queue time 

(98 per cent, which in nearly all cases (96 per cent) was less than 15 minutes). 

An awareness of the environmental context was key to the campaign’s success. 

Training: Following announcement of the by-election, the AEC had to adapt quickly to 
develop and deliver appropriate and relevant training to support a COVID-safe by-election. 
This included specialised training videos and eLearning courses on proper hand hygiene, 
the use of PPE, cleaning surfaces in a polling place and safely managing queues of voters. 
These new training resources complement the AEC’s existing suite of learning products, and 
were produced by the AEC’s specialised National Training and Education Unit in only three 
weeks to meet the timeframe of the by-election. 

Additionally, the AEC’s traditional face-to-face training of polling officials was successfully 
delivered under new social distancing and hygiene requirements. The by-election 
represented the first time that 100 per cent of all polling officials were required to undertake 
at least some of their training online. The AEC’s Learning Management System was able to 
monitor and report on training completion, to ensure that staff had completed all mandatory 
COVID-safe courses before commencing work. 

Voting services: The AEC expanded the number of pre-poll voting centres compared with 
the 2019 federal election (13, an increase of 5), had more centres open for the maximum 
pre-poll period, and adjusted polling places (71, an increase of 2) to spread the flow of voters 
and communicated these to the electorate, along with the option to postal vote. On the basis 
of advice from the Chief Medical Officer, the AEC did not conduct mobile polling for the 
event, and instead established a dedicated team to provide advice and facilitate postal 
voting for aged care facilities and hospitals in the electorate. 

Cost: The COVID-19 prevention measures had a clear impact on the cost of the by-election 
event, almost doubling the total cost, to $3.954 million. In comparison, the by-elections held 
between 2016 and 2019 cost on average approximately $2 million each. While the AEC is 
assessing any potential efficiencies with what was implemented, the vast majority of 
measures will be necessary to implement unless there is a major change in the 
environmental risk. The likely impact on the federal election budget is clear. 

The impact on cost is primarily driven by: additional polling locations throughout the pre-poll 
period and on polling day; additional staff required for sanitising, queue control and vote 
issuing and counting; PPE and other hygiene materials and services; as well as new 
communication and training packages.

Impact on turnout: The by-election had a turnout of 89 per cent, one of the best rates of 
turnout for a by-election, and only a slight drop from the 2019 federal election turnout of 93 
per cent for Eden-Monaro.

Interaction between state and federal laws: As outlined further above, an emergency 
situation may cause conflict between federal and state laws. Where the AEC is attempting to 
manage competing stakeholder expectations, significant complexity is created. For example 
in the Eden Monaro by-election scrutiny centre, combining social distancing requirements 
with the entitlement in the Electoral Act for candidates to be represented by one scrutineer 
per counting officer was challenging given the high number of scrutineers that presented on 
election night. 

Facilitation of non-mainstream categories of electors: Careful consideration is required 
to the impact on services to groups such as overseas electors, voters in aged care facilities, 
hospitals, and remote communities. Without the ability to provide in-person voting services, 
only postal voting is available, which is in turn also impacted by the pandemic situation and 
likely to result in disenfranchisement of electors. For the Eden-Monaro by-election, only 
9  per cent of postal votes sent to overseas electors were admitted to the count, by 
comparison the equivalent rate for the 2019 federal election was 33 per cent. 

Complexity in federal election planning: The AEC is rapidly approaching its minimum 
possible lead times to make large-scale adjustments to its polling premises footprint, staffing 
and budget estimates; to order required materials; and develop required training, procedures 
and communication packages. As such, the AEC must make some assumptions about the 
potential COVID-19 impact as at the earliest possible federal election date (August 2021) 
and plan for an event in a pandemic. 

Page 12


--- Page 14 ---

It should be noted that the requirements and outcomes would certainly have been impacted 
if there were higher levels of community transmission at the time or different local legal 
requirements in place. It was clear during the Eden-Monaro by-election and in the time 
following, that the dynamic nature of the current environment adds a significant layer of 
complexity to planning for an approach to running a federal election in a COVID-19 
environment. This would be compounded where different processes and different materials 
were required in different states as tailoring training, materials and requirements adds 
additional complexity, risk and cost.  

Data collection and analysis 

The AEC has partnered with Deakin University over a number of election events to collect 
data on process timings, run scenario modelling and use this information to help inform 
decisions on the staffing profile, optimum staff numbers and count sizes. This modelling has 
the dual aim of maximising efficiency and minimising queuing. In a COVID-19 scenario, 
minimising the amount of time people are gathered together in a queue is even more 
important.  

Data was collected during the Eden-Monaro by-election at a number of polling centres and 
at the counting centre. The data collected shows that issuing and counting processes took 
longer than those from data collected at previous events. For example, on average the 
ordinary vote issuing process took 16.5 seconds (or 46 per cent) longer than at the 2017 
Bennelong by-election.  

Issuing times may be impacted by a number of COVID-19-related factors, for example: 

 

 

the impact of using masks and screens on communication and efficient vote issuing 

issuing staff sanitising hands between voters 

  having the main queue outside and reducing the ability to use ‘mini-queues’ at each 

issuing point 

  handing out single-use pencils 

  cleaning issuing points and voting screens. 

The AEC has extrapolated the data collected to model federal event scenarios. The table 
below illustrates some of the data modelling conducted to assess the impact of variables on 
time in queue for a polling place expected to issue around 1,200 ordinary votes.  

The scenarios modelled varied the number of issuing officers, voting screens, frequency of 
hand sanitiser use, whether issuing officers provided a pencil to the elector, and whether the 
issuing point was covered during breaks taken by the issuing officer. The model then uses 
data for elector arrival rates across the course of the day, and process timings to arrive at 
estimated average and maximum queues for each scenario.

In order to avoid queue lengths increasing to unacceptable levels, the data modelling shows 
that it is necessary to reduce the table loading (the number of ballot papers each issuing 
officer is expected to issue per day), thereby increasing the overall number of issuing staff. 
In addition, the queue controller positions assigned to each polling place (which would 
normally only be at busier locations) and new hygiene officer position would remain 
imperative.  

Even in times of emergency and crisis, the AEC is of the view that evidence-based staffing 
estimations that prioritise safety and the efficient flow of voters through a polling place is 
preferred. The images from the recent United State elections of hours-long lines for voting in 
various states, such as in Georgia which experienced waiting times of up to 10 hours at one 
location on its first day of early voting, are scenes that would not be tolerated by most 
Australians, even in extraordinary times. 

Having multiple additional staff necessary at every polling location would have a significant 
impact on cost, particularly when applied to a national electoral event. This equates to an 
estimated 30 per cent increase in polling staff required, costing approximately an additional 
$13 million.  

Supply chain implications  

COVID-19 PPE procured for the Eden-Monaro by-election was appropriate and effective. 
The addition of many new materials to AEC polling operations in such a short timeframe 

Page 14


--- Page 16 ---

required new policy development to support polling staff training requirements to create 
effective COVID safety practices and PPE use at polling locations.  

Procurement and consumption analysis data from the Eden-Monaro event has been 
presented in Table 2 below. 

The need for the AEC to continue to ensure its planned practices and PPE will assist it in 
providing a safe environment for electors, staff and stakeholders needs to be of the highest 
priority for the duration of the pandemic. This is brought into sharp relief by reports this year 
from United States election administrators of polling officials and temporary staff falling ill 
with COVID-19; of partial or full closure of polling and processing operations due to COVID-
19 illness or close contact; and of the death of staff who worked at polling booths and in 
elections offices, due to COVID-19. 

For the AEC, when considering supply of COVID-19 PPE for a federal election there are 
challenges with procurement lead times, and supply chain risks to securing these items in 
the timeframe necessary. Assurance of access to the National Medical Stockpile (controlled 
by the Department of Health) would be necessary to provide significant volumes of common 
PPE items (masks, wipes and sanitiser). This would also address the issue of consistent 
product quality as opposed to procuring multiple amounts of different products to meet the 
overall need. COVID-19 global demand for PPE may place supply chains originating 
overseas at risk of not being able to deliver in time for the AEC preparatory needs. 

Additionally, the AEC will face significant challenges for bulk storage availability, and 
associated costs, for these large volumes of PPE on top of the already large volumes of 
material required for a federal election.  

Procuring specialised materials for COVID-19 prevention may raise the cost of running a 
federal election by in excess of $30 million. In addition, it is becoming clear that the cost of 
normal election materials is impacted by the pandemic, where either the materials 
themselves, or components to make them are often sourced overseas.

Conclusion 

This inquiry comes at a unique time in the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, where there 
are many uncertainties and unknowns about what circumstances the nation might find itself 
in at the time of the next federal election.  

We are mindful of the broader focus of the inquiry and understand that during times of 
emergency or crisis - such as a health pandemic, a terror or security incident, a weather 
event or other natural disaster, public unrest, to name a few – we are one small but 
important part of a broader response, which is focused on managing and protecting threats 
to life, health, property and essential services. 

The AEC welcomes ongoing engagement with the Committee during the course of this 
inquiry. We look forward to the Committee’s consideration of the necessary additional 
operational supports to safeguard democracy and enable the AEC to continue to deliver high 
integrity elections, including during an emergency situation.

Attachment A - Responses to 
COVID-19 

The World Health Organisation advises that the virus that causes COVID-19 commonly 
spreads between people through direct, indirect (through contaminated objects or surfaces), 
or close contact with infected people via mouth and nose secretions.1  

This poses fundamental public health challenges for the conduct of an election, which 
involves large gatherings of people for campaigning, canvassing, voting and counting, and 
the handling of equipment and materials by multiple people. As one study noted, ‘More than 
40 points in the electoral process involve the assembly of people or transfer of objects and 
therefore pose risks of virus transmission if no preventive measures are taken.’2 

Initially, many governments around the world, including in Australia, took the decision to 
postpone planned elections. However, increasingly, many elections are proceeding with 
governments holding national or subnational elections as originally planned despite 
concerns related to COVID-19, and holding elections that were initially postponed. 

The experience of selected fellow members of the Electoral Council of Australia and New 
Zealand (ECANZ) in dealing with scheduled electoral events in 2020 has shown a diversity 
of service models and regulatory approaches to dealing with election delivery in the context 
of rapidly evolving conditions and other challenges associated with the pandemic. 

Queensland local government elections were the first large-scale elections conducted in 
Australia following the declaration of a pandemic, with election day falling on 28 March 2020. 

The elections were delivered in a highly dynamic and uncertain environment. This included 
the declaration of a pandemic by the WHO during the election period, and urgent legislative 
and regulatory changes impacting electoral processes that came into effect after early voting 
had commenced on 16 March. Notably, the amended legal framework provided for a 
temporary regulation making power, and enabled the commission to issue Directions 
concerning the distribution or display of how-to-vote cards or other election material.3 

The election saw a significant shift in the voting patterns of the Queensland public compared 
with previous elections:  

  1.2 million people who voted during the two-week early voting period (500,000 in 

2016)  

  470,000 postal votes were returned of the 570,000 issued (320,000 returned in 2016)  

  37,000 people who cast a telephone vote (500 in 2016), and

  750,000 people who voted on election day at a polling booth (1.6 million in 2016). 

Voting for the New Zealand general election took place from Saturday 3 October to 
Saturday 17 October. The timing of the election period was delayed for four weeks on 17 
August 2020 following the reemergence of COVID-19 in New Zealand.  

The legal framework for elections in New Zealand provides powers to respond to defined 
emergency situations. Sections 195 to 195E of the Electoral Act 1993 (NZ), sets out powers 
for responding to an unforeseen or unavoidable disruption that is likely to prevent voters 
voting at a polling place or pose a risk to the proper conduct of an election. The provisions:  

  define the situations when provisions for managing polling disruptions may be used 

  provide for the use of alternative voting processes to respond to polling disruptions 

  provide for an adjournment power 

  outline how the effect of polling disruptions on the preliminary vote count is to be 

manage. 

Notwithstanding these powers, Regulations were also made which provided for special 
measures during a pandemic.4  

Measures implemented at the election included: 

  voters were encouraged to vote early  

  an increase in voting locations

there were around 750 advanced voting locations (up from 485 at the 2017

Preliminary election results reported indicated:  

  over 60 per cent of the 3.2 million enrolled voters cast an advance vote (1,976,996, 

up from 1,240,740 in 2017)  

 

the largest number of advance votes received was on Saturday 10 October, a week 
before the election.7

Due to the ongoing risk posed by COVID-19, the Electoral Commission of Queensland 
adapted its election delivery model. The model was supported by legislative enhancements 
resulting from passage of the Electoral and Other Legislation (Accountability, Integrity and 
Other Matters) Amendment Act 2020. This Act included amendments to the Electoral Act 
1992 (Qld) providing extra flexibility in the statutory framework for the elections including:  

 

flexibility to change dates for election milestones contained in the writ  

  ability for the ECQ to issue notices that change timeframes for postal vote 

applications and expand eligibility for telephone voting  

  power for the ECQ to issue directions regulating the handing out of election materials 

or how-to-vote cards near polling place and the activity of scrutineers, and  

  ability to declare certain classes of voters or electorates to automatically receive a 

postal vote by regulation. 

Measures in place for the election included: 

 

the election was conducted over an election period rather than focussing on an 
election day  

  expanded early voting options were available across the two-week early voting 

period, with extra centres established, and extended operating hours, including from 
9am to 4pm on the Saturday prior to election day  

  electors were, for the first time, able to apply for a postal vote before the issue of the 

writ with applications opening from 14 September 2020 

  declaration of additional categories of electors eligible for telephone voting, and  

  special arrangements for postal voting in aged care and rehabilitation facilities which 

would usually receive a mobile polling service. 

While the election count is still being finalised, pre-poll and postal votes will exceed the 
volumes received at the March 2020 election, with many more people casting their vote 
before election day than on election day.  

Beyond ECANZ, Elections Canada is presently engaging with the Canadian Parliament in 
relation to legislative responses that may assist it deliver an accessible, safe and secure 
election. 

Key elements of its suggested changes, which it proposes to apply to the next general 
election only, include a focus on: 

  extending the voting period, shifting polling day from one 12-hour period on a 

Monday to 8 hours per day on a Saturday and a Sunday 

 

flexibility in approach to aged care facility voting, enabling the Chief Electoral Officer 
to prescribe the timing and manner in which voting occurs at these facilities 

  extending the existing ‘adaptation power’ in section 17 of the Canada Elections Act to 

include all areas within the Chief Electoral Officer’s mandate.

Foreword  

The AEC is committed to providing the highest standard of electoral services for the Eden-
Monaro by-election. During the COVID-19 pandemic this includes a range of safety 
measures for voters, AEC staff and other participants.  

We have introduced a range of COVID-19 safety measures at voting venues and also 
through the entire by-election process, including the receipt and declaration of nominations, 
the management of election materials and at our counting centre.  

The operating model for this by-election includes social distancing and hygiene measures 
that conform with federal and local health advice and are also within the legislative 
framework of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918. The infection-control advice the AEC is 
following has been provided by the Australian Government’s Chief Medical Officer, and 
relevant NSW and ACT health authorities. 

It is also important to note these measures, which must be enacted to protect the 
community, will inevitably slow the voting process. Whilst we are implementing measures to 
try and reduce this impact, the AEC thanks all electors and participants for their patience and 
adherence to the new measures in the polling place and at our count centre. 

The counting of votes will also take longer due to the measures in place in polling places and 
at our counting centre. The expected increase in postal and pre-poll votes cast will also 
impact the speed of the count, noting the legislative requirement to wait 13 days after 
election day for the return of postal votes.  

As a result, it is likely to take longer to formally declare a final result in this by-election 
compared with previous federal by-elections but, as per our normal practice, the AEC will do 
everything possible to provide an indicative result on polling night. 

The AEC is committed to continuous improvement. This service plan outlines the key 
election services and standards that will underpin the AEC’s delivery of the 2020 Eden-
Monaro by-election during a pandemic. 

Should you have any comments on the service plan or the AEC’s delivery on these 
commitments, I would ask you to take the time to let us know through our online enquiry 
form so we can consider your feedback as we continue to improve the delivery of election 
services.

COVID-19 related measures  
for the Eden-Monaro by-election 

The operating model for the by-election will see measures introduced that conform with 
federal and local health advice and are applied within the Commonwealth Electoral Act 
1918. The infection-control advice the AEC is following has been provided by the Australian 
Government’s Chief Medical Officer, and reviewed by NSW and ACT health authorities. 

It is also important to note these measures, which must be put in place to protect the 
community, will inevitably slow the voting process. Whilst we are implementing measures to 
try and reduce this impact, the AEC thanks all electors and participants for their patience and 
adherence to the new measures in the polling places and at our count centre. 

The counting of votes will also take longer due to the measures in place in our polling places 
and at our counting centre. The expected increase in postal and pre-poll votes cast will also 
impact the speed of the count, noting also the legislative requirement to wait 13 days after 
election day for the return of postal votes. As a result, it is likely to take longer to formally 
declare a final result in this by-election compared with previous federal by-elections but, as 
per our normal practice, the AEC will do everything possible to provide an indicative result 
on polling night. 

This document outlines the ways in which the key processes in the operation of the by-
election will be modified or enhanced.  

Taking nominations  

People wishing to nominate for the by-election will need to make an appointment with the 
Divisional Returning Officer for Eden-Monaro before attending the AEC office to lodge their 
nomination forms. At the office, hand sanitiser will be available at the entrance, on all 
meeting tables, and on the way out. AEC staff may wear surgical masks, and social 
distancing of 1.5 metres will be in place wherever possible between staff and nominees.  

Where possible AEC staff will also seek to minimise the amount of back-and-forth handling 
of forms. Contactless Eftpos facilities will be available for candidates to pay their nomination 
fee. 

Ballot draw 

Social-distancing rules will apply to everybody attending the ballot draw and seating will be 
appropriately spaced. Hand sanitiser will be at the entrance and exit of the venue. 

AEC staff performing the ballot draw will observe necessary personal hygiene measures and 
sanitise the equipment used.

During training 

Our online training suite has been enhanced to include a new online training module on the 
required health measures put in place for this by-election. This will be mandatory for all AEC 
staff and temporary election workers working at this by-election. Where AEC staff conduct 
face-to-face training, social-distancing rules will be observed and all of the health measures 
that will be applied throughout the by-election will also be observed throughout the 
corresponding practical exercises. Hand sanitiser will be available on arrival and exit, and 
participants will wash or sanitise their hands before and after each practical exercise. 

Voting for residents of aged care facilities and hospital patients 

The AEC is very conscious of the health and safety of voters during the by-election; 
particularly those who are potentially vulnerable to infection. Accordingly, we have adopted 
special measures to protect residents of aged care facilities and hospitals in the Eden-
Monaro electorate during these extraordinary times, whilst still ensuring they can exercise 
their right to vote. Based on medical advice, the AEC will be providing effective alternatives 
to mobile polling (which are normally a feature of electoral events). Specifically, the AEC has 
established a support team for these facilities and has already provided enrolment forms and 
general postal vote applications for residents to complete and return to the AEC. Residents 
of aged care facilities and hospitals will have the option to either vote via a postal vote 
delivered directly to their facility; telephone voting for those who are blind or low vision; or by 
attending a polling location (depending on their personal circumstances), which will have 
health and safety measures in place.  

The AEC will also maintain ongoing contact with aged care facilities and relevant hospitals in 
the Division of Eden-Monaro to provide support, answer questions and deliver additional 
enrolment and postal vote application forms, if needed.  

Blind and Low Vision 

Voters who are blind or have low vision can cast a vote in secret by telephone from any 
location for the Eden-Monaro by-election. 

Telephone voting is a simple two-step process, voters who are blind or have low vision will 
be invited to register for a telephone vote by calling a dedicated 1800 number for this 
election. They will not need to give their name when they vote using the telephone voting 
service. Their registration number and pin will be used to mark their name off the electoral 
roll, ensuring the voter’s identity remains secret. 

Postal voting 

Postal voting will be an important voting option available to eligible Eden-Monaro electors. 
Postal voting helps minimise contact and movement, and given the COVID-19 environment, 
it is anticipated that a greater number of voters will meet the eligibility criteria under the 
legislation to apply for a postal vote in this by-election.

Voting at polling places 

If on arrival voters are not able to immediately enter the 
polling place, they will be required to queue outside 
where social-distancing rules will be in place. Extra 
queue controllers that have been appropriately trained 
in social-distancing rules and the traditional “six-metre 
rule” regarding campaigners will be outside the polling 
place to ensure adherence to these important 
measures. 

The number of voters entering a polling place will be 
counted at the door to limit the number of people inside 
the polling place at any one time. Hand sanitiser will be 
available at the entrance to the polling place and at 
each ballot-paper issuing point and when exiting the 
polling place. Signage about hygiene and social 
distancing will be prominent in the polling place for 
voters and staff.  

Where possible a “sneeze shield” will be installed at all ballot-paper issuing points, and 
issuing tables will be sprayed regularly with sanitising spray throughout the day and 
whenever issuing staff are rotated. Voters will be encouraged to bring their own pencil or pen 
to the polling place but electors will also be offered a single-use pencil when handed their 
ballot papers. 

Voting screens will separated by a distance of 1.5 metres and the plastic writing surface 
inserted into the voting screen will be regularly cleaned with sanitising spray throughout 
polling day. 

AEC staff may wear surgical masks and will under no circumstances share their bibs or 
lanyards with other staff. Bio-hazard bags will be used for the disposal of surgical masks, 
gloves and cleaning cloth waste.  

Photo opportunities of the inside of a polling place will only be allowed when there is a 
sufficiently low number of voters present so social distancing can be maintained, and when 
the Officer-in-Charge approves. 

Campaigning at polling places 

Whilst the AEC has no legislative jurisdiction or responsibility for campaigners outside six 
metres of the entrance to the polling place, we acknowledge that the current COVID-19 
environment may impact on their ability to hand our how-to-vote cards as they ordinarily 
would for any other federal electoral event. Parties and candidates will need to ensure that 
those campaigning on their behalf near a polling venue have fully informed themselves of 
NSW Government health restrictions and laws in place regarding social distancing, and that 
they abide by these directives. 

Acknowledging the challenges faced by parties and candidates for this by-election, the AEC 
has decided to assist parties and candidates by seeking to collect the details of all 
candidate’s official campaign website addresses at the time of nomination. The AEC will 

Page 4 

Eden-Monaro by-election Service Plan


--- Page 28 ---

provide a link to these websites which will be available on the AEC website alongside the 
candidate’s details. 

Counting on election night at polling places 

After 6pm, when the counting commences at polling places, hand sanitiser for all polling 
place officials and scrutineers will be at the polling place entry point, at each sorting and 
counting table, and at the exit to the polling place.  

Ballot boxes will be cleaned with sanitising spray before they are opened for counting on the 
tables. Staff will sanitise their hands immediately before and after they handle ballot-box 
tags. 

Surgical masks may be worn by both staff and scrutineers, and no sharing of bibs or 
lanyards will be allowed. If practicable, “sneeze shields” may be used at each counting and 
sorting table to separate scrutineers from counting staff. 

There will be signs outlining the hygiene and social distancing rules, and those who do not 
adhere to the rules will be requested to leave.  

The area used for polling and counting at each polling place will be fully cleaned after 
election night. 

Counting at AEC out-posted centres 

Hand sanitiser will be available at the entry and exit of the out-posted centre (OPC), at each 
sorting and counting table and in break-out areas.  

The outside surfaces of election materials returned to the OPC – including ballot boxes 
transported on election night from pre-poll voting centres – will be cleaned with sanitising 
spray on arrival. 

Ballot boxes will be cleaned with sanitising spray before opening, and staff will wash or 
sanitise their hands after handling ballot-box tags, and before and after each count of ballot 
papers. Surgical masks may be worn both by staff and scrutineers and, if practicable, 
“sneeze shields” will be used at each counting and sorting table to separate scrutineers from 
counting staff. 

The OPC will be set up with prominent hygiene signage and 1.5-metre standard markings on 
the floor. There will be regular cleaning of surfaces, equipment and break-out areas during 
operational hours. Only single-use water bottles will be allowed, all plates and cutlery must 
be disposable, and there will be no provision for the serving of coffee or tea inside. 

All equipment used for scrutiny will be cleaned before installing and it will also be regularly 
cleaned during use and before return. Additional Security Officers and Hygiene Officers will 
be present in the OPC to ensure everyone’s safety and adherence to the health measures. 
They will be wearing distinctive bibs.  

Deep cleaning of the OPC will occur overnight and at the conclusion of the counting. 
Biohazard bags will be used to dispose of all waste from the clearing process.

When counting postal votes 

The outside of all transport containers used by Australia Post or couriers will be sprayed with 
sanitising spray prior to opening. 

Hand sanitiser will be regularly applied by staff before opening batches of postal-vote 
envelopes and the extraction of ballot papers. Staff will also wash or sanitise their hands 
immediately before and after each count or when they handle batches of ballot papers.  

Surgical masks should be worn by both staff and scrutineers.  

At the declaration of the poll 

Social-distancing rules will apply to all in attendance and seating will be appropriately 
spaced. Hand sanitiser will be at the entrance and exit of the venue.

                    <p>This document is the Australian Electoral Commission's (AEC) November 2020 submission to the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters, detailing its response to and proposals for conducting elections during emergencies, particularly the COVID-19 pandemic. It draws heavily on experiences from the Eden-Monaro by-election.</p>
<p><strong>Relevance to FOI Request LEX2846:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>AEC's Extensive Preparations for COVID-19 Elections:</strong> The submission outlines the AEC's agility in adapting to the pandemic, including operational changes and proposed legislative reforms for future federal elections. It highlights efforts to maintain electoral integrity and public confidence amidst health risks.</li>
<li><strong>Commonwealth Electoral (COVID Enfranchisement) Regulations 2022 &amp; Legislative Flexibility:</strong> The document explicitly proposes legislative amendments to the <em>Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918</em>, seeking greater flexibility for the Electoral Commissioner. This includes authority to modify electoral processes (e.g., reasons for postal/pre-poll, sole postal voting, streamlining applications), extend operating hours, and safely conduct scrutiny during emergencies. It also seeks power to adjourn or suspend polling and other electoral events, which directly supports the rationale for regulations like the COVID Enfranchisement Regulations.</li>
<li><strong>Secure Telephone Voting System:</strong> The AEC notes the existing telephone voting option for blind/low vision voters and proposes expanding the categories of electors eligible for electronic (telephone) voting during emergencies. For Eden-Monaro, it explicitly facilitated telephone voting for those blind or with low vision.</li>
<li><strong>"Customer Journey" Plans &amp; Staff Scripts:</strong> The document details extensive consultation with Commonwealth and state health authorities, police, and other agencies to develop and implement COVID-safe measures. It describes the rapid development of new, mandatory online training modules and videos for polling officials on hygiene, PPE use, and queue management, reflecting detailed operational planning and staff instruction. Communication campaigns focused on "Plan your vote" and COVID-19 safety, aiming to reduce voter anxiety.</li>
<li><strong>Postal Voting Policy Adaptation:</strong> The Eden-Monaro by-election saw a significant increase in postal votes. The AEC actively facilitated postal voting for vulnerable groups like aged care residents and hospital patients as an alternative to in-person mobile polling, and proposes streamlining postal voting applications for broader use in emergencies.</li>
<li><strong>Reduced Mobile Polling:</strong> For the Eden-Monaro by-election, the AEC explicitly decided <em>not</em> to conduct traditional mobile polling services for aged care facilities and hospitals, instead establishing a dedicated team to facilitate postal voting for these groups based on medical advice.</li>
<li><strong>Logistical and Financial Challenges:</strong> The submission directly addresses these, reporting that COVID-19 prevention measures almost doubled the cost of the Eden-Monaro by-election ($3.954 million vs. average $2 million). It projects substantial cost increases for a federal election (e.g., estimated $13 million for additional polling staff, over $30 million for PPE procurement). Logistical challenges include recruitment difficulties (estimated 30% more polling staff needed), supply chain risks for PPE, and constraints on venue availability.</li>
<li><strong>COVID-Safe Measures at Polling Places:</strong> The attached Eden-Monaro Service Plan details comprehensive measures, including social distancing, hand sanitiser at entrances and issuing points, queue controllers, "sneeze shields," regular sanitisation of surfaces/equipment, single-use pencils, and staff use of masks.</li>
<li><strong>Integrity of New Voting Methods:</strong> The document addresses integrity by detailing how COVID-safe measures would be implemented for counting processes (social distancing, PPE, sanitisation) while accommodating scrutineers. It highlights challenges in balancing social distancing with scrutineer entitlements, underscoring the need for robust mechanisms in adapted processes.</li>

                    <p>This document, titled "Phone Voting for COVID Isolating customers" and dated 1 March 2022, outlines the proposed "Customer Journey" for a secure telephone voting service designed for electors required to self-isolate due to COVID-19. It details a two-stage process:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Registration Service (Online/Phone)</strong>: Voters register online or via phone, providing personal details for verification against the electoral roll and answering eligibility questions related to their isolation status. Eligible voters receive a unique registration number and a self-chosen PIN, along with instructions to view ballot paper information.</li>
<li><strong>Voting Service (Phone)</strong>: Voters call a dedicated voting line, providing their registration number and PIN to a Service Officer (SO) to maintain anonymity. The SO conducts real-time checks to ensure the voter has not previously voted and identifies the correct electorate. The SO then physically marks the voter's preferences on a ballot paper, marks the voter off the electoral roll in the system, and places the completed ballot paper into a secure envelope and ballot box.</li>
</ol>
<p>This document is highly relevant to the FOI request LEX2846 as it directly illustrates the AEC's "extensive preparations" for conducting federal elections amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. It serves as one of the "detailed 'Customer Journey' plans" mentioned in the request overview, specifically supporting the implementation of the <strong>Commonwealth Electoral (COVID Enfranchisement) Regulations 2022</strong> for the secure telephone voting system. It provides operational detail on the new voting methods, outlining the logistical steps, the roles of staff, and the mechanisms designed to maintain the integrity of the vote, such as anonymous registration and real-time voter verification.</p>

17  How the Act applies in relation to secure telephone votes

Schedule 2) applies in relation to a vote cast using a secure telephone vote as if 
the vote were a pre-poll ordinary vote. 

(2)  If an individual votes by a secure telephone vote, the requirements of the Act 

relating to the individual’s right to receive a ballot paper are taken to have been 
satisfied.

                    <p>This document, the <strong>Commonwealth Electoral (COVID Enfranchisement) Regulations 2022</strong>, establishes a secure telephone voting system for the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) to conduct federal elections during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p><strong>Summary of Document Contents:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Purpose and Scope:</strong> The regulations provide a secure telephone voting method for "coronavirus affected individuals" at federal elections, commencing upon registration and repealed at the end of 2022. The Electoral Commissioner has the authority to deem this method unfeasible and suspend its provision, which would not invalidate election results.</li>
<li><strong>Eligibility and Registration:</strong> An individual is entitled to register for telephone voting if they are on an approved voter list, have not already voted, became a "coronavirus affected individual" within four days of polling day (due to a positive COVID-19 test or Minister-specified matter), and are directed to self-isolate/quarantine by a public health authority, which prevents them from attending a polling place. Registration involves providing personal details, making declarations (e.g., not having voted, reason for isolation), and obtaining a registration number and Personal Identification Number (PIN).</li>
<li><strong>Telephone Voting Process:</strong> Eligible registered voters call an authorised call centre. A call centre operator verifies their identity using the registration number and PIN, asks for required declarations, and then assists the voter to cast their vote by telephone. The voter orally dictates their preferences, which the operator marks on a physical ballot paper. The preferences are then read back to the voter for affirmation, and the ballot is placed in a secure envelope and ballot-box. Voters are informed about other voting methods (polling place, pre-poll, postal). The regulations permit informal voting by telephone. Assistance for voters is allowed if declared, with specific exemptions for National Relay Service and interpreter services.</li>
<li><strong>Integrity and Scrutiny Measures:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Scrutineer Observation:</strong> Candidates can appoint scrutineers to attend authorised call centres to monitor call centre operators, including listening to calls (with voter awareness), and to raise objections to voting procedures or ballot paper marking.</li>
<li><strong>Prevention of Double Voting:</strong> A record is made when a secure telephone vote is cast. During scrutiny, ballot papers are excluded if the voter's name is marked as having already voted by other means (e.g., pre-poll, postal).</li>
<li><strong>Security:</strong> Offences are established for false/misleading declarations, interfering with voters or their votes, communicating about votes, attempting to discover how a voter voted, voting more than once (strict liability for each secure telephone vote), and destroying or interfering with voting hardware or software.</li>
<li><strong>Transparency:</strong> A representation of the ballot paper must be available on the AEC website, and scrutiny results are published, identifying secure telephone votes by division.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Operational Flexibility:</strong> The Electoral Commissioner can temporarily suspend telephone polling due to unforeseen circumstances like health hazards or safety concerns.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Relevance to the FOI Request (LEX2846):</strong></p>
<p>This document is central to FOI request LEX2846 as it <strong>is</strong> the "Commonwealth Electoral (COVID Enfranchisement) Regulations 2022" directly referenced. It:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Establishes the secure telephone voting system:</strong> Detailing the mechanisms, eligibility criteria for "eligible self-isolating voters diagnosed close to polling day," and the process from registration to ballot scrutiny.</li>
<li><strong>Supports "Customer Journey" plans and staff scripts:</strong> The detailed procedures for registration, voter interaction, information provision, and ballot marking (Sections 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, 16, 25) directly necessitate comprehensive "Customer Journey" mapping and specific "staff scripts" for call centre operators.</li>
<li><strong>Demonstrates "legislative flexibility for emergency election management":</strong> The regulations themselves are an example of the legislative framework sought by the AEC to manage elections during the pandemic, specifically enabling telephone voting and allowing the Commissioner to suspend services if unfeasible (Sections 7, 18).</li>
<li><strong>Ensures "integrity of new voting methods":</strong> The document outlines robust measures including specific provisions for "scrutineer observation" (Sections 14, 16, 20), mechanisms to prevent double voting (Section 23), and "robust complaint mechanisms" through various specified offences related to voting integrity (Sections 26, 27, 28).</li>

I’m single / isolating away 
from family. Who can I get to 
witness my postal vote? 

The witness requirement is a key integrity measure for postal voting. 
For most, including COVID+ postal voters, they’ll have easy access to 
an appropriate witness. For others, they may be able to arrange with 
family or a friend, with safety measures in place, to complete this 
requirement swiftly &amp; safely.

RESPONSE 

What proof do I need that I’m 
COVID-19 positive? 

If PCR – test centre location, date, time, and ref # from your health 
authority. If RAT – receipt # from health authority you registered your 
test with, and RAT brand and serial number (if avail). 

Where’s my RAT serial or 
reference number? 

Depends on the brand. Could be on the front or back of the packet, or 
next to an image or icon. It’s ok if you can’t find it – but you’ll need the 
brand and receipt # from the health authority that registered the positive 
test.  

Why isn’t the registration 
form working? 

If you’re COVID-positive and trying to register to vote online, there 
might be a delay. Check our website [link] for updates. 

If there was a known outage - unresolved 

Quick update about the online registration form for phone voting if 
you’re COVID-19 positive. Still working to fix it. Visit [link] for more info. 

If there was a known outage - fixed 

Thanks for your patience. The form’s back up now if you’d like to try 
again. 

Why can’t I get through to 
register by phone? 

It’s busy, so might take longer for you get through. Thanks for your 
patience. Keep trying, as queue times can fluctuate. 

How do I vote by phone? 

How can I view my ballot 
papers? 

What are the phone voting 
opening hours? 

Why is it taking so long to 
vote by phone?  

You need to register first. Details are at [link]. Once you’ve registered, 
go to the link from your SMS or email to view an image of the ballot 
papers for your electoral division. Have your eight-digit registration 
number, PIN, and voting preferences ready. 

Ballot papers for all electoral divisions are here [link]. 

Thurs 19 May 8.30am to 5.30pm local time. 

Fri 20 May 8.30am to 6.00pm local time. 

Sat 21 May 8.00am to 6.00pm local time. 

We know it’s frustrating to wait on the phone, especially if you’re not 
feeling well. This is an emergency service, and it’s busy, so there could 
be delays. Our operators also need to follow a process to keep your 
vote secure, which can take time. Make sure you have your voting 
preferences ready. 

How do I know my vote was 
recorded? 

The operator will read your vote back to you. If you wish, you can have 
a different operator read your vote back. 

How will they be counted? 

After voting closes on election day, envelopes will be sorted, 
reconciled, and packed for secure dispatch to their home division. 
There, they’ll be receipted, opened, and counted on the Wed after 
election day.

voting for those who are blind or have low vision, and those in 
Antarctica.  

What about people who 
speak another language? 

Info in 33 languages is here. When calling 1800 413 960 to register or 
vote, people can ask for an interpreter who speaks their language to 
join the call.  

What do you do with 
information from when I 
register?  

We don’t ask for personal details when you call. You get a registration 
number, which you quote when you call to vote. This ensures your vote 
remains secret.  

How can I make a 
complaint? 

You can send an email to phonevote@aec.gov.au

Media responses – secure telephone voting 

Topline talking points 

•  Telephone voting has been introduced as an emergency measure and is strictly only for 

people who have tested positive to COVID after 6pm on the Tuesday evening before polling 
day.  

• 

It will be available from 8.30am Thursday 19 May. 

•  People who tested positive from Saturday 14 May until then should apply for a postal vote.  

•  To access the service electors must prove their eligibility and must have registered their 

positive COVID-19 test – either a PCR or RAT – with their state or territory health authority.  
This is a mandatory requirement. 

• 

Images of the ballot papers will be available for voters to view on the AEC website, to ensure 
those voting by telephone are able to complete the process as easily as possible. 

•  Voter verification will work the same for telephone voting as any other method – voters will 
not be required to present identification in order to have their vote marked against the 
electoral roll. Voters will be making a legal declaration about their identity, as they do when 
voting in person or by post, and that they have not previously voted in this election.  

•  Previously, telephone voting was limited to voters who are blind or have low vision with just 

over 2,000 votes taken via telephone in 2019.  

• 

It is an emergency measure only and there will likely be long wait times to vote with this 
service.   

•  Anyone who is able to visit a polling place should do so. There are more COVID-19 safety 
measures in place than your trip to the local shops – so you can feel safe to turn up and 
vote.  

How secure telephone voting works 

How will telephone voting work? 

There’s two steps for secure telephone voting. 

First, people register to use the service on the AEC website. Voters will need to provide 
evidence of being COVID-19 positive and make a declaration about their eligibility.  

Once the registration form has been submitted, people will get a registration number sent by 
SMS or email. When they call to cast their vote, people will quote this registration number 
rather than their name and address to protect the secrecy of their vote. 

If people don’t have internet access, they can register over the phone. But we expect the vast 
majority to register online. 

We’re asking people to visit the AEC website and look at an image of the ballot papers and 
consider their preferences before calling to vote. This will help make the voting process quicker 
and reduce wait times for the service. 

Then they will call 1800 413 960. They quote their registration number and a call centre 
operator will record the vote. 

How do people prove they’re COVID-19 positive? 

People can only use the telephone voting service if they have registered their positive COVID-19 
test – either a PCR or RAT – with their state or territory health authority. They’ll also need to 
provide evidence of their PCR, such as date and time of positive test result, or evidence of their 
RAT, such as serial number.

How can close contacts vote? 

Close contacts no longer need to isolate. This means they can attend a polling place to vote in 
person. We expect they will follow local health authority guidelines and take appropriate 
COVID-19 safety measures. 

What happens if a close contact has COVID-19 symptoms? 

The AEC is recommending people plan their vote. If people don’t think they will be able to 
vote in person on election day, they may be eligible to apply for a postal vote or attend one of 
our early voting centres. If a family member has COVID-19 in the week before the election, 
close contacts may consider voting early in case they become symptomatic. 

How will COVID-19 positive people know about the service? 

The AEC is running a voter services campaign, which explains to people their voting options if 
they don’t think they will be able to vote in person on election day. This is available in up to 33 
languages. 

In addition, everyone who registers a positive COVID-19 test result with their state or territory 
government will receive information on how to vote while in isolation. State and territory 
COVID-19 web pages and call centres will also direct people to the AEC website to check their 
voting options. 

What are the operating hours?

8.30am to 6pm local time 
8am to 6pm local time 

If a registered COVID-19 positive telephone voter is on the line when voting closes at 6pm on 
election day they will be able to cast their vote, just as is the case for people in the queue at 
6pm at an election day polling place.  

Integrity of the service 

Does this open up the possibility of people voting twice? 

No. As part of the registration process, the voter’s name will be marked off the roll in real time. 
If the voter has already voted they will not be able to register. 

Voters also have to make a declaration when they call to vote that they haven’t voted before in 
this election. 

How is the AEC ensuring electoral integrity given there will be non-AEC call centres taking votes? 

All policies, procedures and training materials have been developed by the AEC in line with 
our existing election and call centre management procedures. As you’d expect, they’re 
standardised, robust, and align with the electronically assisted voting provisions in the 
Electoral Act. 

If pushed 
All staff working on the call centre are employees of the Australia Public Service and have 
undertaken specific training for this service. They also must have signed a Political Neutrality 
disclosure, and there are offences in the Regulation and lawful declarations that the elector 
needs to make. Any breach is a criminal offence.


--- Page 3 ---

How is the service scrutineered? 

Candidates and party-appointed scrutineers can observe the telephone voting process, as is the 
case with every voting process we deliver. This is an important part of the transparency of 
Australia’s election delivery. Voters can request a scrutineer not to observe their phone call, if 
that’s their preference. 

The ballot paper handling requirements in call centres will be subject to the same stringent 
ballot paper handling and reconciliation requirements as in-person polling places.  

Votes will only be counted following secure return to the relevant divisional offices, which is 
also conducted under scrutineer observation. 

How will the secure telephone votes be counted? 

After the close of voting on election day, all the envelopes will be sorted, reconciled and 
packed for secure dispatch to their home division. There, they’ll be receipted, opened and the 
ballot papers counted. 

Operation of the service 

Who is delivering the call centre? 

The secure telephone voting service is being managed by the Australian Electoral Commission, 
using a number of Commonwealth department call centres.  

Operators, like all people involved in the delivery of the election, are required to sign a political 
neutrality declaration – a statement that they will undertake their duties with impartiality.  

How many people do you think will cast a vote by phone? 

COVID-19 case numbers continue to fluctuate. We’re working closely with the Department of 
Health to model expected demand.  

If pushed 

The one thing we know is that COVID-19 is unpredictable. In saying that, if people are tracking 
the number of daily COVID-positive case numbers this should give them an idea of the number 
of calls we’re expecting.  

While experts are predicting numbers to plateau, we’re building a service that will cater for 
above the expected demand, so that there’s coverage if a new variant emerges or numbers 
unexpectedly rise in the week prior to the election. 

If further pushed 

We’ll have approximately 7000 operators for this service. While a significant delivery scale has 
been stood up in a short time frame, we’ve been very upfront that the nature of the service 
will mean people may experience a wait.  

How many how people voted by phone? 

(From Sunday) XX people registered to vote by phone. We’re still reconciling how many then 
called to cast their vote by phone.

                    <h3>Document Summary and Relevance to FOI Request LEX2846</h3>
<p>The document, a set of media talking points titled "Media responses – secure telephone voting," details the Australian Electoral Commission's (AEC) implementation and operational procedures for the new secure telephone voting system, aligning directly with the <strong>Commonwealth Electoral (COVID Enfranchisement) Regulations 2022</strong>. It clarifies that telephone voting is an emergency measure for eligible individuals who test positive for COVID-19 after 6 pm on the Tuesday before polling day, requiring registered positive test results with state/territory health authorities. For earlier diagnoses, applying for a postal vote is recommended, illustrating the AEC's <strong>adapted postal voting policy</strong>.</p>
<p>The document outlines the voter's "Customer Journey," including online registration, receiving a unique registration number, and encouraging voters to view ballot papers online before calling to reduce wait times. It also details the communication strategy to inform COVID-19 positive individuals about the service.</p>
<p>Significant <strong>logistical challenges</strong> are implied through the mention of "likely long wait times," the "significant delivery scale" stood up in a short timeframe, and the deployment of approximately 7,000 operators for the service, suggesting the kind of staffing difficulties and operational pressures the AEC faced and the potential <strong>financial challenges</strong> from such rapid scaling. The document also reinforces <strong>COVID-safe measures</strong> at polling places by encouraging in-person voting for those able, including close contacts.</p>
<p>A primary focus is on maintaining the <strong>integrity of new voting methods</strong>. The document emphasizes mechanisms to prevent double voting (real-time roll mark-off, voter declarations), details AEC-developed, robust procedures for call centre operations (even when using non-AEC staff), requires staff to sign <strong>Political Neutrality disclosures</strong>, and confirms the crucial role of <strong>scrutineer observation</strong> for all stages, from the telephone call process to secure ballot paper handling and counting. These measures underscore the AEC's commitment to robust complaint mechanisms and transparency in the new system.</p>

KEY MESSAGING 
2022 federal election telephone voting system 
Last updated 28 March 2022 – will be updated progressively as more details are confirmed 

About the telephone voting service 

•  We know that some people will be in isolation or quarantine under a public health order during 

the election and will not be able to vote in person. 

•  People can check if they are eligible to vote early if they don’t think they can make it to a 

polling place on election day. Eligible people can: 

o  vote at one of our early voting centres, or  
o  apply for a postal vote by visiting aec.gov.au. Postal voting applications close at 6pm the 

Wednesday before election day. 

•  The AEC may establish a telephone voting service if it’s required, after applications for postal 

voting close for people who are unable to vote in person due to COVID-19. 

Who can use the service 

•  People directed to isolate or quarantine under a public health order may be eligible to register to 
vote by phone after 6pm the Wednesday before election day up until 2pm (TBC) on election day. 

o  This expanded telephone voting service is an emergency measure for the 2022 federal 

election. 

o  Voters accessing the telephone voting service should be prepared for potentially long wait 

times.  

o  Voters will need to make a declaration and provide evidence of their eligibility for 

telephone voting due to COVID-19. 

o  Exact eligibility criteria for the service will be made available soon.  

Safety and privacy  

• 

Integrity is a core AEC value ingrained into all aspects of our operation. The telephone voting 
service is no different. Personal details are only used to register as an eligible voter.  Our voter 
registration systems are designed to protect personal details and have been independently 
assessed for security compliance. 

•  Telephone voting will involve a two-step process to ensure anonymity of voters and the secrecy 

of the vote.  

o  Voters will register, provide a PIN and receive a voting registration number. This will de-

identify the voter and ensure confidentiality of votes.  

o  Voters then call the telephone service to vote. 
o  Voters must provide the PIN and registration number before they can vote. Votes remain 
secret because the AEC voting assistant will not know the voter’s name and address.


--- Page 2 ---

Ballot paper security 

•  The AEC’s Ballot Paper Principles apply, and ballot paper security arrangements will be consistent 

with other polling places. 

•  A Quality Assurance framework will be in place to ensure procedural integrity. 

•  All call centre staff will have to declare political neutrality. 

•  The AEC systems used for registration have had all appropriate cyber security assessments. 

•  The electoral roll is checked for instances of prior voting in the election when they register and 

again when they call to vote. No-one will be able to cast a vote by telephone if they have already 
been marked as voting. 

AEC experience in telephone voting 

•  Telephone voting is a service that the AEC has operated previously for Australian voters who are 

blind or have low vision. 

•  The telephone voting service for COVID-affected electors is based on these existing services and 

has been adapted for scale and eligibility requirements. 

•  The telephone voting service for voters who are blind or have low vision and voters in Antarctica 
will operate separately and will not be affected by the expanded service for voters affected by 
COVID-19. 

Scrutineering and the telephone voting service 

•  A process will be available for scrutineers.  

•  Scrutineering is a fundamental part of the delivery of Australian federal elections. This is being 
planned as part of the scaling up of the telephone voting service for this once-in-a-generation 
pandemic federal election.  

More information 

•  More information will be made available to eligible people ahead of the telephone voting period. 

• 

Information on other ways to vote are at aec.gov.au

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS 

Is this a form of online voting? 

No. Legislation does not currently allow for any form of online voting. The only part of this process to 
take place online is a registration option. Each vote call results in a physical ballot paper being filled 
in and counted in the same way as all other ballot papers. 

What’s the process to ensure the vote is taken correctly by the call centre operators? 

The call centre operator reads back the preferences to the voter once finished, and voters can 
request for a different operator to do this. All operators will be required to declare political 
neutrality. 

What if the call wait times are longer than people are willing to wait? 

Voting is compulsory, however voters with a valid and sufficient reason for not voting will not be 
fined. Voters in this situation can tell us why they cannot vote via email (TBC). 

Voters in the telephone queue at 6pm local time will still be able to cast their vote, similar to the 
queue at in person polling places. 

How is the AEC ensuring my COVID-19 information is protected? 

Voters’ COVID-19 health information is needed to determine eligibility for telephone voting under 
the relevant laws including the Electoral Legislation Amendment (COVID Enfranchisement) Bill 2022. 

The AEC adheres to the Privacy Act and Australian Privacy Principles to ensure personal information 
is protected. This includes the conduct of a third-party privacy impact assessment.</pre>

Eligibility to phone vote  

Issue:  
The Electoral Commissioner Tom Rogers has this morning signed a brief to Government recommending 
that the eligibility for telephone voting services for people who have tested positive to COVID-19 be 
expanded. 

This would see electors who have tested positive to COVID-19 since Saturday 14 May 2022 being able to 
also phone vote. 

(Further information will be provided shortly) 

Eligibility to phone vote  

Issue:  
The Electoral Commissioner Tom Rogers has this morning signed a brief to Government recommending 
that the eligibility for telephone voting services for people who have tested positive to COVID-19 be 
expanded. 

•  At this stage eligibility to use the telephone voting service remains that electors need to have 

tested positive to COVID-19 after 6pm Tuesday 17 May  

• 

If this changes today there will be public communications to advise the detail 

•  AEC general enquiries staff are not to provide the Secure Telephone Voting number for COVID-19 
affected electors to callers who do not meet the criteria. Scripts will be updated if the legislation 
changes. 

Eligibility to phone vote  

Issue:  
The eligibility for the telephone voting service for people who have tested positive to COVID-19 has been 
expanded to include electors who have tested positive after 6pm Friday 13 May.  

Scripts can be found by searching for &#39;Covid&#39;. 

Telephone Voting registration 

Issue: Online registration is now closed for COVID-19 affected electors.  Electors can call 1800 413 960 
to register by phone before 4pm local time Saturday 21 May. 

Telephone voting closes at 6pm local time. Electors will still be able to vote if they have registered and are 
waiting on the line when polls close at 6pm local time on Saturday 21 May.

Telephone voting for COVID-19 affected voters: How to 
register 

Eligibility for telephone voting service 

The service is only for people who’ve tested positive to COVID-19 after 6pm Friday 13 May and 
will still be in isolation on Saturday 21 May. 

You must meet strict eligibility requirements and register by 4.00pm local time Saturday 21 May. 

How to register to vote by phone 

Go to aec.gov.au/covid and follow the prompts. This is the quickest way to register. You can also 
call 1800 413 960, but there may be lengthy wait times. 

Step 1 
Prepare evidence of being COVID-19 positive. This should be: 

• 

• 

If PCR – the location/address of the testing centre, the date and time you received your 
positive test result and the reference number from by your health authority when notified of 
your positive result (if provided). 

If RAT – the brand and serial number of your test (if available), the date and time of your 
positive RAT result, and if provided, a reference number from your health authority when 
you notified them of your positive result. 

Step 2 
Call 1800 413 960. You can ask for an interpreter who speaks your language. Have your evidence 
ready, as during the call you’ll be asked to declare that you’re unable to attend a polling place 
because you’re isolating with COVID-19. You will also be asked to select a six-digit secure PIN. 

Step 3 
You will be sent an eight-digit phone voting registration number by SMS or email. You will need to 
use the PIN and registration number when you call to cast your vote, rather than providing your 
name and address, so your vote remains secret. 

Registration operating hours 

Online registration 

•  Opens Wednesday 18 May 6.01pm AEST. 

•  Closes Saturday 21 May 4.00pm AEST.

Why should I have to vote if I have COVID-19? Will I be fined 
if I have COVID-19 and don’t vote? 

Why should I have to vote if I have COVID-19 

We want to make sure all eligible people are supported to cast a vote and have their say in 
Australia’s future. The phone voting service was introduced as an emergency measure knowing 
many people would be in isolation on election day and still need a way to vote. A reminder that 
voting is also compulsory for Australian citizens aged 18 years and over. 

Fines for not voting 

If you have a valid and sufficient reason for not voting and get a notice, you can write back to 
explain the reason why you couldn’t vote. You should include evidence of being COVID-19 
positive after 6.00pm local time Friday 13 May and will be in isolation on Saturday 21 May. The 
email address is reason@aec.gov.au. 

People who are deaf and COVID-19 positive 

If you’re eligible, you can phone vote with an Auslan interpreter. There are two ways to access the 
service: 

• 

• 

the Convo Australia website – http://www.convoaustralia.com/vote 

the Convo Australia app (download on your personal device (smartphone or tablet). Simply 
tap the AEC logo to make a direct connection with an Auslan interpreter. 

Your interpreter will then connect you to the secure telephone voting service number and assist 
you with your vote. 

Applied for but haven&#39;t received postal vote 

If you tested COVID-19 positive after 6pm Friday 13 May, you can register to vote by phone. Make 
sure you call to vote as soon as you can after this, as there might be a long wait on election day. 

Received postal vote but now eligible for phone vote 

There’s still time to complete and return it to us. Ballot papers must be completed and witnessed 
on or before election day and sent back by Fri 3 June. It could be a long wait on the phone on 
election day. 

I can’t find the serial number on my RAT. 

The location will depend on the brand of RAT you used. The number could be on the front or back 
of the packet, or next to an image or icon. It’s ok if you can’t find it – but to prove eligibility, you do 
need to provide the brand and receipt number from the health authority that registered the positive 
test (if available).  

5


--- Page 6 ---

I can’t find my registration number or PIN 

When you registered, the operator will have asked if you wanted to receive your registration 
number and PIN by SMS or email. You might like to re-check your phone or inbox in case the 
message went into another folder. If you still can’t find either number, you can call 1800 413 960 to 
register again. 

The phone wait time is too long; I can’t get through; I don’t 
want to wait on hold; How long is the hold time? 

Phone wait times 

We know it’s frustrating to wait on the phone, especially if you’re not feeling well. I understand the 
service is experiencing high demand, which means it might take longer for you get through. 
Thanks for your patience as we work to help all eligible people cast their vote. 

Can’t get through 

I understand the service is experiencing high demand, which means it might take longer for you 
get through. Thanks for your patience as we work to help all eligible people cast their vote. 

How long voting takes by phone 

This is not a service the AEC usually provides, so voting by phone will take longer than if this was 
done in person or by post. The operator needs to follow a process that keeps your vote secure. 
They must confirm your details, find the ballot papers for your electoral division, record how you 
wish to vote for both papers, read back your selection and then re-confirm this is how you wish to 
vote.  

To make things quicker and reduce wait times, visit the AEC website to look at an image of ballot 
papers for your electoral division and consider your preferences before calling to vote. 

What will happen if I’m still on hold after 6pm on election 
day? 

You’ll still be able to cast your vote if you registered and are waiting on the line to vote when polls 
close at 6.00pm on Saturday 21 May. You won’t be able to vote if you call after 6.00pm. 

What happens to completed ballot papers after I vote by 
phone? What happens to my personal information? 

What happens to completed ballot papers 

After voting closes on election day, envelopes will be sorted, reconciled, and packed for secure 
dispatch to their home division. There, they’ll be receipted, opened, and counted from the 
Wednesday after election day.

--- Page 7 ---

Security of ballot papers 

Ballot paper handling requirements in call centres are subject to the same stringent handling and 
reconciliation requirements as in-person polling places. Votes will only be counted after secure 
return to the relevant divisional offices, which is also conducted under scrutineer observation. 

What happens to my personal information 

We handle personal information in accordance with privacy legislation, and this includes securely 
storing the info provided when you register. Visit the privacy page of our website for details. 

We won’t ask for your personal details when you call to vote. You’ll quote a registration number we 
provided to you by SMS or email. This ensures your vote stays secret. 

How is the service scrutineered 

It&#39;s the same as every voting process we deliver. Candidates and party-appointed scrutineers can 
observe, or you can ask that a scrutineer not do this if it’s your preference. Votes will only be 
counted after secure return to the relevant divisional offices, which is also conducted under 
scrutineer observation. 

I don’t want to vote by phone; I want to vote online. 

No online voting for federal elections is available, regardless of personal circumstances. 

I’m overseas. Can I use the phone voting service? 

No, the phone voting service is only able to be used by eligible individuals in Australia. 

COVID-19 affected voters calling from Norfolk and Cocos 
(Keeling) Islands 

Advice provided to Service Officers 

For callers from Norfolk and Cocos (Keeling) Islands who call and request to be transferred to 
the COVID-19-affected Secure Telephone Voting service you can do so. 

Please note: do not transfer any callers other than from Norfolk and Cocos Islands to the Secure 
Telephone Service. 

How is the AEC managing the COVID-19 rules in relation to 
hygiene and physical distancing? 

The Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) has worked closely with the Department of Health to 
manage the risks around COVID-19 at the next election. If you attend an Early Voting Centre or a 
Polling Place, you will notice changes from previous elections. 

Precautionary measure have been put in place to help protect electors and polling staff, including: 

7


--- Page 8 ---

•  The number of people allowed in a voting venue will comply with Health guidelines, based 

on the size of the venue 

•  Hand sanitiser will be available throughout all Early Voting Centres and Polling Places 

•  Voting screens, common surfaces and touch points will be cleaned regularly, 

•  How-to-vote cards will not be used more than once 

•  A Queue Controller will ensure the room capacity is maintained with safe queue distancing 

observed 

•  A Hygiene Officer will also oversee that hygiene is maintained within the polling place 

•  Bio-waste bins will be provided on site to dispose of used PPE. 

•  Signage on hygiene and social distancing will be displayed around the polling place as well 

as floor markers 

We are also asking people to bring their own pencil – a big change from past election. Single use 
pencils will be available if required and can be kept by the voter or disposed of in the bin near the 
polling place exit. 

Physical distancing rules and increased cleaning may mean voting will take a little longer than 
normal – so make sure you plan ahead.

                    <p>The document consists of internal Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) contact centre scripts and information regarding the <strong>COVID-19 Secure Telephone Voting</strong> service for the 2022 federal election, outlining its operational implementation.</p>
<p><strong>Key aspects detailed include:</strong><br />
*   <strong>Eligibility Criteria:</strong> The criteria for telephone voting evolved, initially requiring a positive COVID-19 test after 6pm Tuesday 17 May, then expanded to after 6pm Friday 13 May, and subsequently Saturday 14 May, with the elector needing to be in isolation on Election Day (May 21). Evidence (PCR or RAT details with health authority reference) was required.<br />
*   <strong>Registration and Voting Process:</strong> Electors registered online or via a dedicated phone line (1800 413 960). Registration involved providing evidence of COVID-19, declaring isolation, and selecting a secure PIN, after which an eight-digit registration number was issued. To vote, electors called back, provided their registration number and PIN (ensuring secrecy), viewed ballot papers online, and verbally conveyed their preferences to an operator.<br />
*   <strong>Operational Management:</strong> The document provided specific operating hours and advised callers of expected "long call wait times" due to high demand and the longer nature of phone voting. It confirmed that electors on hold at the 6pm poll closing time on Election Day would still be able to vote.<br />
*   <strong>Accessibility:</strong> Services included access to multilingual interpreters and specific provisions for deaf voters via Auslan interpreters through Convo Australia.<br />
*   <strong>Integrity and Secrecy:</strong> Vote secrecy was maintained by using unique registration numbers and PINs instead of personal details during the voting call. The document affirmed that ballot paper handling and counting procedures, including scrutineer observation, followed the same stringent security requirements as in-person polling.<br />
*   <strong>Compulsory Voting:</strong> It clarified that being COVID-19 positive and in isolation on Election Day constituted a valid and sufficient reason for not voting, provided evidence was supplied if a non-voter notice was issued.<br />
*   <strong>Polling Place COVID-Safe Measures:</strong> The document outlined various measures implemented at Early Voting Centres and Polling Places, such as capacity limits, hand sanitiser availability, regular cleaning of surfaces, single-use how-to-vote cards, dedicated queue controllers and hygiene officers, bio-waste bins, signage, floor markers, and encouragement for voters to bring their own pencils.</p>
<p><strong>Relevance to FOI Request LEX2846:</strong><br />
This document is highly relevant to FOI request LEX2846 as it directly illustrates the AEC's <strong>extensive preparations for conducting federal elections amidst the COVID-19 pandemic</strong>. It serves as a practical demonstration of the <strong>"Customer Journey" plans and staff scripts</strong> developed for the <strong>Commonwealth Electoral (COVID Enfranchisement) Regulations 2022</strong>, particularly detailing the operational mechanics of the <strong>secure telephone voting system</strong>. The challenges highlighted, such as long wait times, implicitly point to the <strong>logistical challenges</strong> faced by the AEC. The dynamic changes in eligibility criteria noted in the document reflect the AEC's need for and adaptation to <strong>legislative flexibility for emergency election management</strong>. Furthermore, the document explicitly details the <strong>COVID-safe measures</strong> implemented at polling places and reinforces the mechanisms (e.g., vote secrecy, scrutineer observation) used to maintain the <strong>integrity</strong> of these new voting methods.</p>

--- Page 3 ---

Purpose of policy 

The purpose of this policy is to describe the postal voting categories, application 
procedures and processing of applications in accordance with the Commonwealth 
Electoral Act 1918 (the Electoral Act). 

1.  Postal voters 

1.1  There are two categories of postal voters:  

• 

• 

Those people that apply for a postal vote for a particular federal event. These people have to 
apply to be sent voting papers for the applicable event. 

Those people that are registered as a General Postal Voter and have a registration code against 
their enrolment record. These people are automatically sent voting papers at the time of any 
election.  

2.  Postal voting for a particular event 

2.1  A person may apply for a postal vote on specified grounds. Those grounds are set out in Schedule 2 

to the Electoral Act. In general terms, an elector may apply for a postal vote if, on polling day, they: 

• 

• 

• 

• 

• 

• 

• 

• 

• 

• 

are outside the electorate where they are enrolled to vote 

are more than 8km from a polling place 

are travelling 

are unable to leave their workplace to vote 

are seriously ill, infirm or due to give birth shortly (or caring for someone who is) 

are a patient in hospital and can&#39;t vote at the hospital 

have religious beliefs that prevent them from attending a polling place 

are in prison serving a sentence of less than three years or otherwise detained 

are a silent elector 

have a reasonable fear for their safety. 

2.2  A postal vote application (PVA) must be in writing on the form approved by the Electoral 

Commissioner (EC) which includes a declaration by the applicant that they are entitled to apply for a 
postal vote. A PVA may also be lodged online. 

2.3  An application may not be made until after the public announcement of the proposed date for polling 

or after the issue of a writ for an election or referendum (whichever is the earlier) (s 184 and Schedule 
2 of the Electoral Act). An announcement concerning an intended date for polling does not necessarily 
meet the requirements of s 184 of the Electoral Act. The AEC may issue advice clarifying whether 
PVAs may be accepted in such instances. 

Note: The following clause will be affected by the decision that has been made not to visit said facilities for 
the next election due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Further details on what arrangements will be made for 
these electors will be released once confirmed. 

2.4  As soon as the public announcement of the election date is made, every effort must be made to 

ensure that PVAs are also made available at places where mobile polling facilities may not be 
provided during the election period, for example:  

3       POLICY POSTAL VOTING


--- Page 4 ---

• 

• 

• 

nursing homes 

hospitals 

high-care facilities (including those in retirement villages and residential mental health facilities) 

•  mining camps 

• 

prisons 

Note: It is important to ensure that all places holding stocks of PVAs are made aware of the need to 
destroy superseded forms where the EC revokes an approved PVA and approves a replacement PVA. 

2.5  PVAs must be received by 6 pm on the Wednesday prior to polling day to be accepted. 

2.6  Section 184AA of the Electoral Act allows political parties and candidates to distribute PVAs with party 

material attached.  

3.  General postal voters (GPVs) 

3.1  An elector may apply for registration as a General Postal Voter (GPV), which entitles the elector to 

have postal ballot papers for future federal elections automatically sent to them. 

3.2  An application for registration as a GPV must be made on one of the grounds specified in the Electoral 

Act (s 184A). In general terms, an elector can register to become a general postal voter if they are: 

• 

• 

• 

• 

• 

• 

• 

• 

• 

• 

• 

enrolled at an address more than 20 km away from a polling place 

a patient at a hospital or nursing home and unable to travel to a polling place 

unable to travel due to being infirm at home 

caring for a seriously ill or infirm person 

serving a prison sentence of less than 3 years 

registered as a silent elector 

unable to attend a polling place due to religious beliefs 

unable to sign their name due to a physical incapacity 

registered as an overseas elector 

a member of the defence force, or a defence civilian serving outside Australia 

an Australian Federal Police officer or staff member serving outside Australia. 

3.3  There is no requirement that the application be made on an approved form, however the AEC strongly 
prefers to receive applications on forms approved for this purpose. To register as a GPV, electors can 
complete the GPV application form, which is available from any AEC office or on the AEC website.  

3.4  An application to be registered as a GPV can be made at any time (s 185 of the Electoral Act). 

Accordingly, the process to register a GPV can also be done at any time. As soon as the ballot papers 
for an election are available, postal voting papers must be sent to GPVs (s 186 of the Electoral Act). 

3.5  The EC must keep a register of GPVs for each division. Each register is to be made available for 
inspection by members of the public at the office of the DRO for the division during ordinary office 
hours (s 184B the Electoral Act). The GPV register must be printed from RMANS and further 
information can be found in Roll-How. 

3.6  The registration of an elector as a GPV may be cancelled by the EC if the ground on which the elector 

applied for registration no longer exists (s 185C of the Electoral Act). Although a registration can be 
cancelled at any such time, it is important to recognise that where that cancellation occurs after the 
close of the roll for an election, the elector remains entitled to a postal vote for that election. For 
information on the cancellation of GPV registrations, see Roll-Why. 

4       POLICY POSTAL VOTING


--- Page 5 ---

3.7  Unlike PVAs for a particular event, the GPV registration process does not involve supplying or 

authentication of a security question/answer before registration may occur.  

3.8  Any GPV applications received between the close of rolls and the deadline for receiving PVAs can be 

accepted as a PVA and as a GPV registration. Because of this, the GPV forms cannot be scanned 
and processed as PVAs by the scanning service provider and instead should be copied and 
processed as PVAs manually into the AEC’s automated postal vote issuing system (APVIS) by 
divisions. The elector should also be registered as a GPV for subsequent events – due to ongoing 
state and local elections the registration should be completed as soon as possible. 

4.  Use of PVAs by candidates and political 

parties 

Supply of paper PVAs 

4.1  Where the EC revokes a PVA form and approves a replacement, the Assistant Commissioner, 

Delivery and Support Branch is to contact all registered political parties, to advise them of the new 
approved form and the need to destroy superseded forms that may be being held as stock. 

4.2  All members, Senators and candidates will be encouraged to promote the Online Postal Vote 

Application (OPVA) with their constituents. This service ensures that the AEC receives the 
applications in a timely manner and can send the postal vote pack out as soon as possible. 

4.3 

If requests for paper PVA forms (and reply envelopes) are received by states and divisions, these 
must be redirected to the Elector and Roll Services team. This team will then investigate the reasons 
for the request and if the OPVA is not suitable, will direct them to the pdf version on the AEC website. 
This includes requests from  

•  Members and Senators 

• 

• 

• 

• 

political parties 

candidates 

state/territory members of parliament 

political interest groups (unions, lobby groups, peak industry bodies). 

Reproduction of PVAs 

4.4  Subsection 184AA(1) of the Electoral Act allows a postal vote application form to be “physically 

attached to, or form part of, other written materials issued by any person or organisation.” This allows 
for political parties to provide PVAs to constituents alongside election materials.  

4.5  The majority of paper PVA forms received by the AEC for processing during an event are those which 
have been reproduced by a political party or candidates. It is important that the AEC communicates to 
political parties and candidates the importance of reproduced PVAs aligning with legislative 
requirements to ensure electors are not disenfranchised and the scanning of said forms is as efficient 
as possible.  

4.6 

It is the State Manager’s role to communicate PVA requirements with political parties in the lead-up to 
electoral events however Elector and Roll Services will provide information and guidance regarding 
the key points related to postal voting. The information obtained from political parties these meetings 
(e.g. what their plans are regarding postal voting) should be treated confidentially; at a minimum it 
should be known by the relevant State Manager, Director Operations, Director of Elector and Roll 
Services Section in NO, and the relevant DRO. 

4.7  The AEC provides print-ready artwork of the approved form and guidelines for its reproduction to any 

person or organisation that wishes to reproduce PVAs. Requests to obtain a copy of the approved 

5       POLICY POSTAL VOTING


--- Page 6 ---

form and guidelines are to be made to the Director, Elector and Roll Services Section in National 
Office (NO) through the AEC Service Desk. The office lodging this request via the AEC Service Desk 
must also ensure that the relevant AEO is to be advised of this request. 

4.8  When dealing with candidates and political parties it is useful to ascertain relevant information 

concerning their postal vote mail campaigns and provide information to them regarding AEC 
processes. Relevant information includes approximate volumes, areas of letterbox drops, and dates 
and intended method of delivery, noting that, if a Service Provider is being used, completed paper 
PVAs must be sent directly to that provider. This exchange of information will assist offices to manage 
the workload, especially planned peaks in activity, but as this information is confidential (see 4.6) 
steps must be taken to ensure only the information shared within the AEC network as needed.  

5.  Receipt of PVAs 

5.1  Divisional offices (DOs) are not required to stay open to the public until 6pm on the Wednesday three 
days before polling day to enable receipt of PVAs. However if members of the public come to a 
divisional office when it is closed to the public, but staff are inside working, staff should attend to the 
person and assist wherever possible. This may include accepting a paper form for processing. 

5.2  The PVA scanning provider must stay open until 6pm (local time) on the Wednesday three days 

before polling day to enable receipt of PVAs (s 184(5) of the Electoral Act). The scanning provider 
must clear PO boxes, scan, vet and provide the data from the PVAs that evening to ensure the Postal 
Vote Packs (PVP) can be produced and lodged as soon as possible.  

5.3  Divisions must also factor in time to process after this deadline into their staffing plans, noting that 
OPVA and scanned PVA data may not appear in the manual intervention or local print queues until 
6.30pm (local time) due to the background system work. 

5.4  PVAs may be made to the EC or, in the case of an application made outside of Australia, also to an 

Assistant Returning Officer (ARO) (s 184 of the Electoral Act). 

5.5  While every effort should be made to ensure that superseded forms are destroyed, a PVA that is 
made on a superseded form should be accepted if the application substantially complies with the 
approved form, that is, if the application contains all the information that is required by the Electoral 
Act and is received before 6pm on the Wednesday three days before polling day. 

• 

For example, a form stating it must be received by 6pm Thursday two days before polling day 
(forms used at 2013 election stated this) may be accepted, but only if it satisfies the essential 
criteria set out below. 

5.6  The following criteria are essential for a PVA to be considered valid: 

• 

the application must include a declaration of entitlement to apply for a postal vote (s 184(1) of the 
Electoral Act) 

− 

− 

paper applications – the declaration of entitlement is the signature 

online applications – the declaration of entitlement is the submission of the form 

• 

• 

• 

the application must be dated (note – the date is automatically generated if a PVA is submitted 
online) 

the date must not be before the announcement of or issue of writ for an election or referendum 
(an incorrect date in the future however is acceptable provided the PVA is received on time) 

the application must be received by 6pm on the Wednesday three days before polling day 
(s 184(5) of the Electoral Act) (refer to clause 6.10 in this policy). 

PVAs not meeting these criteria must be rejected and a defective PVA letter sent to the 
applicant. 

5.7  The following criteria are not essential for a PVA to be considered valid: 

6       POLICY POSTAL VOTING


--- Page 7 ---

• 

• 

• 

• 

• 

• 

applicant’s full name details (e.g. an initial is given instead of a given name) 

applicant’s enrolled address details 

applicant’s date of birth 

postal address 

contact phone number or email address 

security question and answer 

If a PVA is missing any or all of these details it must still be accepted. 

5.8  The assessment of substantial compliance on non-PVA forms (i.e. letters, form reproductions etc.) 
must be sent to the Elector and Roll Services team. A decision on these will be done on a case by 
case basis by the Assistant Commissioner, Elector and Roll Services Section (or delegate) and advice 
provided to staff directly or via the intranet (if a trend emerges). 

5.9 

If a PVA meets the essential requirements set out above, the postal voting material must be sent to 
the applicant (s.188(1) of the Electoral Act). 

6.  Processing paper PVA forms  

6.1 

Information from PVA forms will be captured electronically (via a Service Provider with OCR/ICR 
capability) and/or manually via data entry by AEC staff in RMANS APVIS. 

6.2  Timeliness and quality are paramount in either of the above options. If a Service Provider is used: 

6.2.1  Arrangements will be made to ensure they receive the paper PVAs as soon as possible. This will 
include directions to candidates and parties to directly deliver bulk PVAs to the Service Provider, 
the Service Provider managing the PO Boxes advertised on the form and AEC website for 
returned completed forms and the electronic transfer of PVAs from AEC offices to the Service 
Provider. 

6.2.2  Strict business and quality rules will be established to ensure correct identification of paper 
PVAs and the correct and efficient capture of data on said forms. These vetting rules will be 
published before each election and exceptions to these rules will be managed by Elector and 
Roll Services.  

6.2.3  The Service Provider will regularly feed PVA data back to the AEC. This data will be processed 

in RMANS APVIS  

Note: A paper PVA form may meet the vetting rules in 6.2.2 but will still need divisional intervention in 
RMANS APVIS if RMANS cannot make the necessary matches to determine entitlement. 

6.3  The Service Provider will hold PVA images in an accessible repository for scrutiny and archiving 

processes. Staff will have access to these images via RMANS APVIS and Declaration Vote Scrutiny 
sub-systems.  

6.4 

If a Service Provider isn’t being used, PVAs can be manually entered by divisional staff in AEC offices, 
OPCs or in state cells, depending on state management plans.  

6.5  States must ensure that they have sufficient staff (with appropriate systems and RMANS APVIS 

access) and resources to: 

6.5.1 

receive PVAs and transfer them to the Service Provider (as long as the PVA is received by the 
AEC by the deadline); and  

6.5.2  process PVA records received back from the Service Provider in RMANS APVIS efficiently, 

including after the 6pm deadline. 

6.6  Forms processed in AEC offices must be stored securely as they contain personal information.  

7       POLICY POSTAL VOTING


--- Page 8 ---

Forwarding paper PVAs received in an AEC office to the Service 
Provider 

6.7 

If a Service Provider is being used, staff are reminded that the Service Provider’s processes will result 
in a timelier capture of data, depending on when the forms are sent to them. Therefore, staff must 
send all paper PVAs to the Service Provider either via electronic transfer or courier. For example:  

• 

if a box of forms is dropped off (e.g. by a candidate or party official), then AEC staff must advise 
that they should be delivered to the Service Providers address. If they refuse to deliver them to 
the correct address, or they have been left by a courier, then that box of PVAs should be 
couriered directly to the Service Provider as is (i.e. the box shouldn’t be opened and checked). If 
1-100 forms are received, states and divisions must electronically send them to the Service 
Provider as they are received. 

o  Forms electronically sent to the Service Provider must be stored securely, but separately to 

those in 6.6 

•  However, if that box is received between 12-6pm on the Wednesday before polling day, the box 

should be opened and the PVAs transferred electronically to the Service Provider. Whilst strict 
vetting is not required in this scenario, the removal of obviously incomplete or non-PVA material 
should be done. 

6.8  GPV forms must be retained in the office and processed directly into RMANS APVIS. 

Failure to meet deadline for PVA 

6.9 

 If a PVA is received after 6pm on the Wednesday three days before polling day, it fails to meet the 
deadline and the applicant should be advised of that fact and that they will have to vote by other 
means (s 184(5), 184(6) of the Electoral Act).  

6.10 

If the PVA is received by the Service Provider, the AEC may decide to use their services to send a 
“PVA received too late” message (via email or SMS) to the applicant. The Service Provider will also 
scan and transfer the data contained on the PVA to the AEC.  

6.11 

If the paper PVA is received by an AEC office then AEC staff should attempt to contact the elector and 
process the PVA in RMANS APVIS as too late. 

6.12 

If a large number of forms are received by AEC offices after the deadline but before polling day (i.e. 
from a candidate or party) these should be sent to the Service Provider (if being used) as they will be 
able to scan and notify applicants more efficiently than divisional staff. 

7. 

Issuing postal votes 

7.1 

If the EC or an ARO receives a PVA that meets one of the specified grounds, the EC or ARO must 
send a Postal Voting Certificate (PVC) and the postal voting papers to the applicant.  

7.2  Postal voting material (including the PVC) may be generated and issued centrally (via a Service 

Provider), locally or by a ‘hybrid’ method, where for certain postcodes the system will use local printing 
from a particular location regardless of where the PVA was processed. RMANS APVIS will be used to 
determine the method that ensures the best possible delivery timeframe.  

7.3  PVCs with House of Representatives ballot paper stock attached to them are considered ballot 

papers. The handling, storing and transporting of PVCs must comply with requirements of the Ballot 
Paper Handling Policy, prior to, during dispatching and upon return to the division. Preparation and 
issuing of PVCs must be done in a ballot paper secure working zone whether being dispatched by a 
Service Provider or AEC office. 

7.4 

It is expected that RMANS APVIS would be used to issue all PVCs, however in circumstances where 
the system is not available (e.g. due to a network or power failure) it may be necessary to issue PVCs 
manually (see Producing Postal Vote Certificates SOP).  

8       POLICY POSTAL VOTING


--- Page 9 ---

8.  Delivery of postal votes 

8.1  The AEC endeavours to deliver postal votes in sufficient time for the elector to vote before 6pm on 
polling day. Postal vote material must be sent by post or other means, not being electronic means 
such as fax or email.  

8.2  Postal votes are normally delivered to the applicant by Australia Post priority service, however for all 

PVAs received before 6pm on the Wednesday three days before polling day, the postal voting material 
must be sent to the applicant by a means considered to be the most reasonable and practicable in the 
circumstances (s 188(2) of the Electoral Act). 

8.3  Therefore all divisions must develop a postal vote delivery plan that does not depend on Australia Post 
factors in the time taken to print locally and collate the PVC packs. This will require divisions to 
investigate the alternative non-Australia Post delivery options available in their divisions for sending 
postal voting material where the postcode is hybrid in RMANS APVIS or local knowledge indicates 
that delivery by means other than Australia Post needs to be considered. 

8.4  Where the use of standard, priority or express postal services or standard courier services is likely to 
lead to disenfranchisement, other services can be used as long as delivery of the voting material can 
be achieved within the necessary timeframes and does not exceed a cost of $100 per elector 
serviced. 

• 

For example: delivering postal votes to a remote township of 20 electors at a cost of $1,500 
would be acceptable since the cost is $75 per elector.  

8.5  Reasonable and practicable means of delivery includes: 

• 

• 

commercially available couriers 

vehicle or taxi use by an AEC staff member. 

8.6  Reasonable and practicable means does not extend to providing a PVC to a third party authorised by 

the applicant. 

8.7  The EC (or delegate) may decide that Australia Post is still a reasonable and practicable means of 
delivery. This would apply in circumstances where a postcode receives regular mail services.  

8.8  A means of sending postal voting material will not be a reasonable and practicable means of delivery if 
it cannot be expected that the applicant would receive that material in sufficient time to vote before 
close of polling (s 194 of the Electoral Act). 

8.9  DROs must receive approval (including Rule 18 financial approval) from state office if they use a 

means of delivery other than those described above. Any service which exceeds the cost per elector 
threshold is to be treated as a policy exception. 

9.  Silent electors 

9.1  Most silent electors are registered as GPVs, and receive postal voting material automatically through 

central production, however some may choose to apply for postal votes.  

9.2  Silent electors are able to apply using the online PVA system, however it is recommended they use 

alternative forms of voting to ensure maximum confidentiality of their information. 

9.3 

If a silent elector chooses to lodge a PVA online or their paper PVA is sent to the scanning centre, 
their classified information will be suppressed in RMANS APVIS once they are matched as a silent 
elector. 

9.4 

If a silent elector’s Postal Vote Pack (PVP) can be printed and lodged via central print, then the 
relevant data will be sent as part of the daily postal voting data file to the Service Provider. 

9       POLICY POSTAL VOTING


--- Page 10 ---

9.5 

9.6 

If a local or hybrid print PVP is required, then only an AEC employee that has permission from the 
AEC to deal with silent electors can manually prepare postal voting materials for silent electors.  

If the elector has included their enrolled address on a PVA (that is stored in a divisional office) it must 
be masked or obliterated by using a black marker pen. 

10.  Replacement of spoilt, missing, lost or 

destroyed postal ballot papers  

10.1  A postal voter who spoils a postal ballot paper may obtain another postal ballot paper by returning the 
spoilt ballot paper to any AEC office. A replacement postal ballot paper may then be posted or issued 
personally to the voter at any time up to the close of the poll. However, the postal voting material must 
not be sent by post (or any other means) if it cannot be expected that the applicant would receive that 
material in sufficient time to vote before close of polling (s 194 of the Electoral Act). 

10.1.1  If a person cannot physically attend the office to return their spoilt ballot paper, and they claim 

that they cannot make their intended preference clear, advice should be sought from Elector and 
Roll Services on how to proceed (via the AEC Service Desk) 

10.2 

If an elector claims that their ballot paper (or PVC) has been lost, destroyed beyond salvage, or was 
never received, a new PVC may be issued by reprocessing the PVA, provided the elector has 
provided written confirmation attesting to this. 

11.  Postal ballot papers returned undelivered 

11.1  Any postal voting material returned undelivered prior to polling day should be dealt with immediately. 
Every effort should be made to re-direct the postal voting materials and document steps taken, if any 
are possible, to achieve this (see Postal Voting SOP). 

12.  Receipting postal vote certificates 

12.1  PVCs are to be receipted on their arrival at AEC premises. This may be conducted at the divisional 
office, state processing cell, or once transferred to the divisional out-posted centre. The process for 
receipting PVCs is covered in the Receiving Postal Votes SOP. Note that PVCs are ballot papers and 
are to be handled in accordance with the Ballot Paper Handling Policy. 

12.2  PVCs must be receipted up to and after the 13 day post polling receipt period. This information flows 
into ELMS allowing for accurate estimates for declaration exchange, postal scrutinies and the virtual 
tally room advising parties, candidates and the general public as to how many votes are left to count 
and how many were too late. The Elector and Roll Services team will advise when the RMANS Dec 
Vote Scrutiny system is locked and when receipting PVCs can cease. All PVCs received after the 
cutoff must remain securely stored until otherwise advised.

Glossary for postal voting 

Automated Postal Vote Issuing System (RMANS APVIS): is an election sub-system of the Roll 
Management System (RMANS EP) used for the registration of PVA details to issue PVCs or defective 
letters. APVIS also captures the date of lodgement with Australia Post and when the PVC is returned to the 
AEC. 

Ballot paper secure work zone: designated and segregated area, clearly marked via use of bollards, 
dividers or tape, for the interim placement of ballot papers while they are in use and it is not practicable to 
undertake the work in a storage zone (see Ballot Paper Handling Policy). 

Computershare (CCS): AEC’s PVA scanning and PVP mail house services contractor who will receive, 
scan and vet all postal vote applications and prepare and lodge PVPs. 

General Postal Voter (GPV): an elector who is registered to have postal ballot papers sent to them 
automatically. Electors from certain categories who have difficulty getting to a polling place on polling day 
can register as a GPV. 

Optical Character Recognition / Intelligent Character Recognition (OCR/ICR): OCR/ICR technologies 
translate scanned images into data that can be used in database systems and verified against other data. 

Online Postal Vote Application (OPVA): an electronic form that allows an applicant to securely submit a 
PVA to the AEC using any web-enabled device in Australia or overseas. 

Postal voter: a voter who satisfies one of the grounds of application for postal vote set out in Schedule 2 of 
the Electoral Act and who may apply in writing for a postal vote using a PVA form. Upon receipt of a PVA, 
postal voting material will be dispatched for completion and return prior to the close of poll. 

Postal Vote Application (PVA): an application for a postal vote which must be in writing on the form 
approved by the Electoral Commissioner which includes a declaration by the applicant that they are entitled 
to apply for a postal vote. A PVA may also be lodged online.  

Postal Vote Certificate (PVC): the declaration specific to postal voting on which the elector declares their 
entitlement to vote. PVCs may be produced using PVA information entered into APVIS by either: 

•  Central production: a PVP is produced centrally to ensure timely delivery to the postal voter. 

•  Hybrid print production: where the postcode has only one or two mail deliveries per week and 
APVIS determines if the PVC is best printed by the owning divisions or another nominated 
division. 

• 

Local print production: printing PVCs in divisional/state offices when central production could 
not ensure timely delivery of the PVP. 

Postal Vote Pack (PVP) or postal voting materials: the certificate and ballot papers issued to an applicant 
for a postal vote. A postal vote pack consists of the following and are inserted into an outer envelope 
addressed to the elector. 

• 

• 

• 

• 

the printed PVC with attached House of Representatives ballot paper 

Senate ballot paper 

referendum ballot papers (if applicable) 

a domestic or overseas postal voting leaflet (Getting help to complete your postal vote leaflet

                    <p>The "Postal Voting Policy" (February 2022) outlines the Australian Electoral Commission's (AEC) procedures for postal vote applications (PVAs), including categories of voters, application processing, and delivery of voting materials.</p>
<p><strong>Relevance to FOI Request LEX2846:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>COVID-19 Adaptation &amp; Reduced Mobile Polling:</strong> The document directly reflects the AEC's adaptation to the COVID-19 pandemic by explicitly stating a decision "not to visit said facilities [nursing homes, hospitals, etc.] for the next election due to the COVID-19 pandemic" (p.3). This signifies a deliberate reduction in mobile polling for these groups, necessitating a greater reliance on postal voting, aligning with the FOI request's scope.</li>
<li><strong>Logistical &amp; Financial Challenges:</strong> It addresses logistical and financial considerations for managing increased postal voting. The policy details the use of a "Service Provider" for efficient PVA scanning and data capture, and mandates AEC divisional offices to have "sufficient staff" and resources for processing (p.7), reflecting the staffing and resource challenges noted in the FOI request. Furthermore, it outlines provisions for "alternative non-Australia Post delivery options" (p.9) for postal votes, including cost thresholds and approval processes for special delivery, indicating proactive measures to mitigate logistical hurdles and manage associated financial implications to ensure timely delivery.</li>
<li><strong>Integrity of New Voting Methods:</strong> The policy emphasizes maintaining the integrity of the postal voting process through strict validation criteria for PVAs (p.6), secure handling and storage of forms and data (p.7), and adherence to the "Ballot Paper Handling Policy" for Postal Vote Certificates (p.8, p.10). Procedures for managing silent electors' confidentiality are also detailed (p.9).</li>
<li><strong>Scope Limitation:</strong> While highly relevant to the "postal voting policy" aspect, this document does not contain information regarding the "Commonwealth Electoral (COVID Enfranchisement) Regulations 2022," the "secure telephone voting system," "Customer Journey" plans, "staff scripts," or "COVID-safe measures at polling places," which are broader components of the FOI request overview.</li>

                    <p>The document is an internal Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) file register, providing an index of documents related to its COVID-19 pandemic response.</p>
<p><strong>Relevance to FOI Request LEX2846:</strong></p>
<p>This document directly supports the FOI request overview by demonstrating the breadth and depth of the AEC's preparations and adaptations for conducting federal elections during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Legislative Changes and Enfranchisement:</strong> The entry "2022 Legislative Change - COVID enfranchisement" confirms the AEC's engagement with legislative adjustments, aligning with the "Commonwealth Electoral (COVID Enfranchisement) Regulations 2022" mentioned in the FOI request.</li>
<li><strong>Operational Planning and Challenges:</strong> Numerous entries related to "COVID-19 Planning," "COVID Crisis Scenario Testing," "COVID-19 - staffing," and "Procuring a consultant" for a "Covid19 Response Unit" underscore the significant logistical, financial, and staffing challenges faced by the AEC.</li>
<li><strong>COVID-Safe Measures:</strong> The register details extensive efforts to implement COVID-safe measures, evidenced by entries such as "COVID-19 WHS products," "State COVID Safe Plans," "PRJ - COVIDSafe Plan," and "SCM Policy COVID PPE responses." These indicate the AEC's focus on ensuring health and safety at polling places.</li>
<li><strong>Policy and Communication:</strong> Documents like "COVID-19 Policy - ELECTIONS, BALLOTS AND REFERENDUMS," "COVID-19 Communications," and "COVID-19 eLearning" highlight the AEC's development of new policies, public communication strategies, and staff training to adapt to the pandemic and maintain the integrity of new voting methods.</li>
<li><strong>Comprehensive Management:</strong> The presence of timeline documents ("COVID-19 Timeline 2020," "COVID-19 Timeline of Events") and various reports ("COVID-19 Analysis," "COVID-19 Surveys") indicates a comprehensive, data-driven approach to managing the pandemic's impact on electoral processes.</li>
</ul>
<p>In essence, this document serves as a foundational index, validating the specific areas of AEC activity and documentation outlined in the FOI request overview.</p>

This contradicts the value of reason by showcasing an irrational preference for bureaucratic micromanagement over individual autonomy and efficient, market-driven solutions. The implied rejection of secure online voting (as noted in the FOI request overview) in favor of more cumbersome processes like \"secure telephone voting\" further highlights a resistance to rational, technological advancement in favor of state-controlled, less efficient methods.\n*   **Individualism:** The very nature of the \"COVID Enfranchisement Bill and Regulations,\" especially when contextualized by compulsory voting, reflects a fundamental assault on individualism. It positions individuals not as sovereign entities with the right to choose their level of civic engagement, but as components of a collective duty to be \"enfranchised\" or managed by the state. The \"Customer Journey \u2013 Proposed Voting Experience for Covid Isolating Customers DRAFT v7\" embodies this collectivist view, reducing individuals to \"customers\" to be guided through a pre-defined, state-mandated process, rather than autonomous agents capable of independent action and decision-making. The necessity for \"advice to AEC social media staff and call-centre workers on how to assist voters who are COVID-positive\" underscores the state's paternalistic desire to direct individual actions, encroaching on personal responsibility and privacy, especially concerning medical information (as noted in the overview).\n*   **Free Enterprise:** The sheer scale of the documents requested and released implies a substantial diversion of resources\u2014taxpayer money, manpower, and intellectual capital\u2014away from productive, wealth-creating activities in the private sector. The \"billions extracted from taxpayers\" (from the overview) to fund this bureaucratic overhead, which manifests in detailed policies, scripts, and \"customer journeys,\" represents capital consumed by the state for coercive administrative tasks rather than contributing to innovation, investment, or voluntary exchange. This systematic preference for centrally planned \"nanny state\" dictates stifles the natural processes of free enterprise and efficient resource allocation.\n\n**Evidence of Negative Objectivist Points:**\n\n*   **Bureaucratic Obstacles:** The document itself is a testament to the creation of immense bureaucratic obstacles. The proliferation of \"drafts of legislation,\" \"explanatory material,\" \"policy tables,\" \"policy papers,\" \"executive briefs,\" \"ministerial briefs,\" and specific \"scripts\" and \"talking points\" illustrates an unwieldy and complex system designed to manage a process that, from an Objectivist viewpoint, should be simpler and less intrusive. This level of internal documentation points to significant overhead and potential inefficiency, impeding the productive deployment of resources.\n*   **Forced Altruism:** While not explicitly stated within this document, the context of the FOI request\u2014specifically the mention of compulsory voting and \"COVID Enfranchisement\"\u2014strongly implies forced altruism. The government's efforts to ensure participation, even for COVID-positive individuals through specific mechanisms like \"secure telephone voting\" that might require \"mandatory disclosure of private medical information\" (as per the overview), demands individuals sacrifice their personal choice, privacy, and convenience for a perceived collective good or duty, characteristic of forced altruism.\n*   **Suppression of Productive Achievement:** The extensive resources dedicated to establishing and maintaining this complex electoral management system, funded by coercive taxation, directly suppresses productive achievement. Capital and human effort that could have been used to create value, innovate, or contribute to voluntary economic activity are instead channeled into an expansive, coercive state apparatus. The preference for \"archaic processes\" like telephone voting over more efficient technological solutions (like secure online voting, mentioned in the overview) further exemplifies a systemic resistance to efficiency and productive advancement in favor of centralized control.", "model": "gemini-2.5-flash", "generated_at": "2025-06-24T02:15:19.943901", "source_hash": "513cbfbc1a0adafb1a3c07fd5084558f20e4c1db2bc1bd5ea6bab2bec7a62951", "raw_response_path": "data/llm_responses/LEX2846__per_file__objectivist__lex2846-schedule.pdf__20250624T021519.json", "output_tokens": 861, "prompt_tokens": 752, "total_tokens": 3031, "summary_length": 4800}}, "original_url": "https://www.aec.gov.au/information-access/foi/2022/files/lex2846-schedule.pdf", "link_text": "FOI Request LEX2846, Schedule of Released Documents [PDF 125KB]", "server_filename": "lex2846-schedule.pdf", "extracted_text": "\n\n--- Page 1 ---\n\nRequest for: \n\nFOI REQUEST NO.

It draws heavily on experiences from the Eden-Monaro by-election.\n\n**Relevance to FOI Request LEX2846:**\n\n*   **AEC's Extensive Preparations for COVID-19 Elections:** The submission outlines the AEC's agility in adapting to the pandemic, including operational changes and proposed legislative reforms for future federal elections. It highlights efforts to maintain electoral integrity and public confidence amidst health risks.\n*   **Commonwealth Electoral (COVID Enfranchisement) Regulations 2022 & Legislative Flexibility:** The document explicitly proposes legislative amendments to the *Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918*, seeking greater flexibility for the Electoral Commissioner. This includes authority to modify electoral processes (e.g., reasons for postal/pre-poll, sole postal voting, streamlining applications), extend operating hours, and safely conduct scrutiny during emergencies. It also seeks power to adjourn or suspend polling and other electoral events, which directly supports the rationale for regulations like the COVID Enfranchisement Regulations.\n*   **Secure Telephone Voting System:** The AEC notes the existing telephone voting option for blind/low vision voters and proposes expanding the categories of electors eligible for electronic (telephone) voting during emergencies. For Eden-Monaro, it explicitly facilitated telephone voting for those blind or with low vision.\n*   **\"Customer Journey\" Plans & Staff Scripts:** The document details extensive consultation with Commonwealth and state health authorities, police, and other agencies to develop and implement COVID-safe measures. It describes the rapid development of new, mandatory online training modules and videos for polling officials on hygiene, PPE use, and queue management, reflecting detailed operational planning and staff instruction. Communication campaigns focused on \"Plan your vote\" and COVID-19 safety, aiming to reduce voter anxiety.\n*   **Postal Voting Policy Adaptation:** The Eden-Monaro by-election saw a significant increase in postal votes. The AEC actively facilitated postal voting for vulnerable groups like aged care residents and hospital patients as an alternative to in-person mobile polling, and proposes streamlining postal voting applications for broader use in emergencies.\n*   **Reduced Mobile Polling:** For the Eden-Monaro by-election, the AEC explicitly decided *not* to conduct traditional mobile polling services for aged care facilities and hospitals, instead establishing a dedicated team to facilitate postal voting for these groups based on medical advice.\n*   **Logistical and Financial Challenges:** The submission directly addresses these, reporting that COVID-19 prevention measures almost doubled the cost of the Eden-Monaro by-election ($3.954 million vs. average $2 million). It projects substantial cost increases for a federal election (e.g., estimated $13 million for additional polling staff, over $30 million for PPE procurement). Logistical challenges include recruitment difficulties (estimated 30% more polling staff needed), supply chain risks for PPE, and constraints on venue availability.\n*   **COVID-Safe Measures at Polling Places:** The attached Eden-Monaro Service Plan details comprehensive measures, including social distancing, hand sanitiser at entrances and issuing points, queue controllers, \"sneeze shields,\" regular sanitisation of surfaces/equipment, single-use pencils, and staff use of masks.\n*   **Integrity of New Voting Methods:** The document addresses integrity by detailing how COVID-safe measures would be implemented for counting processes (social distancing, PPE, sanitisation) while accommodating scrutineers. It highlights challenges in balancing social distancing with scrutineer entitlements, underscoring the need for robust mechanisms in adapted processes.", "model": "gemini-2.5-flash", "generated_at": "2025-06-24T00:05:03.505327", "source_hash": "4abbee108b2112e84e145a4933a0ae917bab08f41b8efcc9b66a53d8869462d9", "raw_response_path": "data/llm_responses/LEX2846__per_file__balanced__Doc 01 - IS20-0000009_ JSCEM Submission No. 17.pdf__20250624T000503.json", "output_tokens": 772, "prompt_tokens": 15672, "total_tokens": 19454, "summary_length": 4095}, "left_leaning": {"needs_summary": true, "source_hash": "4abbee108b2112e84e145a4933a0ae917bab08f41b8efcc9b66a53d8869462d9"}, "right_leaning": {"needs_summary": true, "source_hash": "4abbee108b2112e84e145a4933a0ae917bab08f41b8efcc9b66a53d8869462d9"}, "government_skeptic": {"needs_summary": true, "source_hash": "4abbee108b2112e84e145a4933a0ae917bab08f41b8efcc9b66a53d8869462d9"}, "government_apologist": {"needs_summary": true, "source_hash": "4abbee108b2112e84e145a4933a0ae917bab08f41b8efcc9b66a53d8869462d9"}, "highly_critical": {"needs_summary": true, "source_hash": "4abbee108b2112e84e145a4933a0ae917bab08f41b8efcc9b66a53d8869462d9"}, "objectivist": {"text": "This document, an Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) submission to a parliamentary inquiry, outlines the AEC's challenges and proposed legislative amendments for conducting elections during emergency situations, using the COVID-19 pandemic and the Eden-Monaro by-election as case studies. The AEC seeks greater flexibility for the Electoral Commissioner to determine electoral processes and to adjourn or suspend polling/other election requirements when impacted by an emergency. It details logistical challenges (staffing, materials, premises, service suppliers), impacts on voter turnout and existing services, and the need for a streamlined approach to engage with various government and health stakeholders. The Eden-Monaro by-election experience demonstrated increased costs (nearly doubling to $3.954 million, with a projected $13 million extra for staffing and $30 million for PPE in a federal election), longer processing times, and complex coordination across jurisdictions to implement safety measures. The submission implicitly highlights the prescriptive nature of the current Electoral Act as a barrier to agile responses.\n\nFrom an Objectivist perspective within the context of the FOI request:\n\nThis document strikingly reflects the negative consequences of collectivism and central planning, fundamentally contradicting the values of reason, individualism, and free enterprise.\n\n*   **Reason:** The document implicitly exposes the irrationality of a system that prioritizes physical attendance and archaic processes over rational, technological solutions. While the AEC *seeks* more flexibility for the Electoral Commissioner to act with reason in emergencies, the very \"emergency measures\" and the underlying system are depicted as inherently inefficient. The extensive data modeling for queue times (Table 1) exemplifies a bureaucratic application of reason to manage an *irrational* problem (forced physical queues) rather than embracing a truly rational solution like secure, decentralized online voting, which is mentioned only as requiring \"significant review and adjustment\" \u2013 a clear bureaucratic obstacle. The massive cost increases ($2 million to $3.954 million for one by-election, projected tens of millions for a federal election) demonstrate an irrational diversion of productive capital to maintain a cumbersome, centrally controlled process, rather than innovating for efficiency.\n\n*   **Individualism:** The document portrays the individual as a \"voter\" whose participation must be \"safeguarded\" and \"managed\" within a collective electoral process, rather than as a sovereign entity with the right to voluntary participation or non-participation. The efforts to \"ensure the safety of voters and electoral officials\" and \"inspire trust and sustain public confidence\" are framed as collective goods that demand significant resources and new bureaucratic powers. The underlying premise of compulsory voting, though not explicitly mentioned here, is reinforced by the AEC's extensive efforts to maintain high turnout rates (89% for Eden-Monaro) despite health risks and logistical hurdles. This signifies **forced altruism**, where individuals are compelled to participate in a collective duty and sacrifice their time, health, and resources for a \"democratic\" imperative, rather than pursuing their own self-interest. The limited options for non-mainstream voters (e.g., overseas electors) highlight a practical disenfranchisement when the centralized, physical system faces disruptions, forcing a choice between participation under difficult conditions or forfeiture.\n\n*   **Free Enterprise:** The document operates entirely outside the principles of free enterprise, instead revealing a system rife with **bureaucratic obstacles** and **suppression of productive achievement**. The AEC, a government monopoly, seeks to expand its central planning powers (\"Enabling the Electoral Commissioner to determine how certain electoral processes... may be undertaken,\" \"Providing the Electoral Commissioner with the authority to make a decision to adjourn or suspend polling\"). The \"significant investment of time\" and \"immense value\" derived from \"close consultation with a great number of stakeholders, including Commonwealth and state government agencies\" for a *single by-election* illustrates the sheer bureaucratic complexity and inefficiency inherent in a centrally managed system. These consultations include seeking approval from various ministers (Health, Education, Local Government), police, and other government bodies for basic logistical arrangements like using school premises or managing campaign material. The \"almost doubling\" of by-election costs and the projected tens of millions for a federal election, drawn from taxpayer money, represent a direct **suppression of productive achievement**. This capital is extracted from the productive sector of the economy and channeled into administrative overhead, PPE, and additional staff for queue management \u2013 a direct result of centrally planned dictates and a stark contrast to the efficient, voluntary exchanges characteristic of free enterprise. The document's detailed accounting of PPE procurement challenges further underscores the inefficiency of government supply chains compared to market mechanisms.", "model": "gemini-2.5-flash", "generated_at": "2025-06-24T02:15:40.643389", "source_hash": "4abbee108b2112e84e145a4933a0ae917bab08f41b8efcc9b66a53d8869462d9", "raw_response_path": "data/llm_responses/LEX2846__per_file__objectivist__Doc 01 - IS20-0000009_ JSCEM Submission No. 17.pdf__20250624T021540.json", "output_tokens": 928, "prompt_tokens": 15736, "total_tokens": 18383, "summary_length": 5301}}, "filename": "Doc 01 - IS20-0000009_ JSCEM Submission No. 17.pdf", "download_path": "/foi_assets/LEX2846/Doc 01 - IS20-0000009_ JSCEM Submission No. 17.pdf", "extracted_text": "\n\n--- Page 1 ---\n\nNovember 2020 \n\nInquiry on the future conduct \nof elections operating during \ntimes of emergency situations \n\nAustralian Electoral Commission submission to the Joint \nStanding Committee on Electoral Matters\n\n\n--- Page 2 ---\n\nContents \n\nIntroduction ........................................................................................................................... 2 \n\nAdministering elections in emergency situations ................................................................... 3 \n\nThe complex environment ................................................................................................. 3 \n\nProposed areas of legislation for consideration of amendment ............................................. 6 \n\nExisting provisions ............................................................................................................. 7 \n\nResponding to the COVID-19 pandemic ............................................................................... 9 \n\nEden-Monaro by-election................................................................................................... 9 \n\nConclusion .......................................................................................................................... 17 \n\nAttachment A - Responses to COVID-19 ............................................................................ 18 \n\nAttachment B \u2013 Eden-Monaro by-election Service Plan ...................................................... 21 \n\nPage 1\n\n\n--- Page 3 ---\n\nIntroduction \n\nThe Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) welcomes the opportunity to make this \nsubmission to the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters (the Committee) inquiry on \nthe future conduct of elections operating during times of emergency situations. \n\nA federal election is perhaps the biggest peacetime logistical event in Australia, and \ncontinues to grow in scale and complexity. There are currently over 16 million Australians \nenrolled to vote, and the federal election dates are not known in advance. Once the writs are \nissued, the AEC mobilises to identify suitable polling staff, venues, and all supporting \nlogistical arrangements to administer the event.  \n\nEmergency situations are inherently difficult to predict and are typically associated with high \nlevels of uncertainty about either their cause or the scope and severity of their impacts.  An \nemergency situation has the potential to affect more than one jurisdiction, impact the \ncommunity, and create pressure for resources when there is competing demand.  \n\nThe Australian federal electoral system may be vulnerable to emergency situations in \ncircumstances where key components of the election are disrupted, including voting, election \nadministration and campaigning. The timing and location of an emergency situation will \ninfluence the required adjustments to administration and the mitigation strategies which are \nused.  \n\nThere are a number of key limitations in the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 (Electoral \nAct) that could constrain the AEC\u2019s ability to respond to circumstances requiring suspension \nor disruption to components of election delivery, including at polling places.  \n\nThis submission highlights requirements for Parliament\u2019s consideration that would assist the \nAEC in continuing to deliver high integrity federal elections through various emergency \nscenarios at the national, state, or regional level.  \n\nTo this end, the AEC considers the following amendments to legislation are advisable in \norder to provide the AEC with greater flexibility to respond to emergency situations: \n\n\uf0a7  Enabling the Electoral Commissioner to determine how certain electoral processes \nand activities may be undertaken, where these processes or activities are impacted \nby an emergency situation \n\n\uf0a7  Providing the Electoral Commissioner with the authority to make a decision to \n\nadjourn or suspend polling, or provide for the temporary suspension or adjournment \nof other events. \n\nPage 2\n\n\n--- Page 4 ---\n\nAdministering elections in \nemergency situations  \n\nBuilding confidence and trust in elections is as complex as it has ever been. The AEC is \ncommitted to ensuring Australia\u2019s elections are conducted in a manner that inspires and \nsustains confidence of the public, and election stakeholders.  \n\nAn enduring challenge in the electoral environment during ordinary times is maintaining a \nmutual understanding amongst electoral stakeholders of the shared responsibilities and \naccountabilities in a number of areas, including maintaining voters\u2019 trust in elections and \nensuring proactive actions are being taken to meet reasonable expectations around flexibility \nand responsiveness while providing for electoral integrity. \n\nElection planning and delivery in an emergency situation involves new stakeholders with \ntheir own remits and additional complexities. A more flexible legislative framework would \nprovide the AEC with greater flexibility to respond to emergencies and their impact on the \npublic and election stakeholders. \n\nThe complex environment  \n\nExternal guidance \n\nMost emergency situations will involve a declaration under Commonwealth, state or territory \nlaw. Those charged with managing an emergency situation and its consequences have \npressing priorities related to their respective remits around preservation and protection of \nlife, health, property and essential services. \n\nDuring any emergency situation, the AEC is only one stakeholder in a complex environment. \nManagement of an election during an emergency situation requires engagement with \nministers and senior officials across governments as well as advisory bodies. The specific \nstakeholders and their respective roles and responsibilities are dependent on the nature and \nseverity of the emergency situation, and can evolve as the situation changes.  \n\nA challenge with delivering a federal electoral event in a state or territory with a declared \nemergency will be conducting the event consistently with state or territory emergency \nrequirements. While the constitutional position is that a state or territory law should not \nprevent a Commonwealth agency or a person from carrying out their responsibilities under \nCommonwealth law, it will nevertheless be important to work with local authorities to ensure \nelectoral events are conducted consistently with local emergency requirements so that \nelectors, staff and others in an election are not put at risk.  \n\nA critical feature of the successful delivery of the Eden-Monaro by-election in the COVID-19 \nenvironment was the significant investment of time required, and the immense value \nobtained, from engaging with government departments across jurisdictions before and \n\nPage 3\n\n\n--- Page 5 ---\n\nduring the by-election. In delivering the by-election the AEC liaised closely with the \nCommonwealth Chief Medical Officer and the NSW Department of Health, emergency \nservices, the Electoral Integrity Assurance Taskforce and political participants. A similar \nmodel of consultation is in train for the Groom by-election.  \n\nThe AEC\u2019s emergency situation response requires a streamlined approach to access key \nstakeholders, such as police, fire and emergency services, Chief Medical Officers, Defence \nand central security agencies. \n\nKey logistical challenges \n\nEmergencies can pose major logistical difficulties that could force significant compromises, \ndelays, or even render an election partially or fully undeliverable.  \n\nStaffing: The delivery of elections is reliant on huge temporary workforces who in an \nemergency situation may be less available. At a federal election the AEC relies on a \ntemporary workforce of approximately 90,000 people. Recruitment of temporary workers is \nincreasingly challenging in normal circumstances and an emergency situation could \nsuddenly pose significant recruitment and absenteeism challenges that could threaten the \ndelivery of the election. This is amplified in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic where \nadditional staff will be required to perform hygiene and sanitisation duties, manage queues \nand maintain voting service levels. \n\nMaterials and logistics: Supply chains are also likely to be affected depending on the scale \nof the emergency. The rapid outbreak of COVID-19 resulted in global shortages of personal \nprotective equipment (PPE) and lockdowns affected the transportation industry resulting in \nthe slower delivery of food and other supplies. In these circumstances, the supply of \nessential items for an election could become difficult or unattainable.   \n\nTurnout: Limitations on the movement and concentration of electors together with the risks \nof casualties during an emergency situation (for example, a natural disaster) can impact \nvoter turnout at an election and the legitimacy of the result. \n\nPremises: An election relies on the availability, at short notice, of thousands of premises to \nconduct voting and for counting centres. An emergency situation may reduce the availability \nor suitability of premises or reduce the willingness of venue owners to hire to the AEC.   \n\nService suppliers: The AEC partners with external service providers to facilitate aspects of \nthe election. Any impact to these major suppliers would have significant flow-on effects to \nthe running of an election event \u2013 for example in the preparation and dispatch of postal \nvotes, scanning and data capture of Senate ballot papers, printing of ballot papers, \npreparation of paper and electronic certified lists, etcetera. \n\nExacerbated existing challenges: Conducting an electoral event during an emergency \nsituation will exacerbate existing election delivery challenges including: \n\n\uf0a7  access to electoral services by electors: \n\no  with disability \no \no \n\nliving or travelling overseas \nlocated in regional and remote areas \n\nPage 4\n\n\n--- Page 6 ---\n\no  experiencing homelessness \n\n\uf0a7 \n\n\uf0a7 \n\nthe impacts of increasing number of electors voting early \n\nreliability and timeliness of postal services \n\n\uf0a7  provision of services to electors in Indigenous communities. \n\nArrangements for a federal election commence immediately following the previous one, with \napproach and policy decisions required early in order to implement required contracts, \nmaterials and plans in advance of the earliest possible election date. Changes to an election \ndelivery model will be shaped by election delivery options at that time.  \n\nBusiness Continuity \nThe AEC already has planned contingencies in place that position it to respond to significant \nbusiness disruption during the election period as part of its business continuity planning \narrangements. \n\nProposals that allow for greater flexibility in the way in which the AEC might respond to \nemergency situations will strengthen the AEC\u2019s ability to effectively respond to and mitigate \nbusiness disruptions caused by such emergencies. \n\nPage 5\n\n\n--- Page 7 ---\n\nProposed areas of legislation for \nconsideration of amendment   \n\nThe prescriptive nature of the Electoral Act provides limited flexibility for how an election can \nbe conducted. For example, the Electoral Act provides few exceptions to the requirement for \nphysical attendance when voting, and those exceptions (for example, postal or telephone \nvoting) may not be available to all or scalable in an emergency situation.  \n\nTemporary modification \n\nTo provide greater flexibility in the event of an emergency situation, the Electoral Act could \nbe modified, for example, to: \n\n\uf0a7  extend the reasons electors can postal or pre-poll vote \n\n\uf0a7  conduct an election solely by postal vote (in some or all geographic areas) \n\n\uf0a7  streamline application and/or declaration requirements for postal voting and pre-poll \n\nvoting \n\n\uf0a7  expand categories of electors who may utilise the electronic (telephone) voting \n\nmethod \n\n\uf0a7  extend operating or polling hours, and/or \n\n\uf0a7  conduct scrutiny more safely.  \n\nAny modifications to the Electoral Act would only be possible for federal electoral events \nconducted in a state or territory or a geographic area of Australia where there is a declared \nemergency.    \n\nGiven the timeframes prescribed in the Electoral Act for conducting federal electoral events \n(from as little as 33 days), it is recommend that the authority to make emergency \nmodifications:  \n\n\uf0a7  may be exercised when there is a local or national emergency situation declared (or \n\nother public direction or determination made by a Minister in relation to an \nemergency\u2019s effects on an election) under Commonwealth, state or territory law  \n\n\uf0a7 \n\n\uf0a7 \n\nis limited to the extent necessary to conduct an electoral event in the circumstances \n\nis exercised by the Electoral Commissioner and cannot be delegated to others \n\n\uf0a7  must be exercised by prescribing the modification in an instrument that will be tabled \n\nin Parliament \n\n\uf0a7 \n\nis time limited, for example available only for the necessary time to respond to the \nemergency situation and its impact, or conduct the electoral event. \n\nTo exercise the authority to make emergency modifications the Electoral Commissioner \nwould have regard to the following matters: \n\n\uf0a7 \n\nthe election is conducted in a manner that inspires trust and sustains public \nconfidence \n\nPage 6\n\n\n--- Page 8 ---\n\n\uf0a7 \n\n\uf0a7 \n\nthe need to ensure the safety of voters and electoral officials \n\nthe election process and release of results occur in a timely manner.  \n\nPractically, the exercise of any authority will be shaped by the time and operational \nenvironment of the given situation, and election delivery options available at that time. \n\nThe exercise of this authority would be subject to Parliamentary scrutiny in the same manner \nas the conduct of federal elections is reviewed in detail by the Joint Standing Committee on \nElectoral Maters. \n\nThe temporary nature of the modification means the electoral system remains unchanged \nonce the emergency situation has passed. \n\nAdjournment and temporary suspension \n\nSections 240A, 241 and 242 of the Electoral Act provide for the temporary suspension of \npolling and adjournment of polling (to another day) in certain circumstances. These sections \ndo not provide for flexibility in who may make a decision to adjourn or suspend polling, or \nprovide for the temporary suspension or adjournment of other election requirements, for \nexample where an emergency may affect close of rolls, nominations, early voting or scrutiny.  \n\nThe AEC recommends that Parliament consider broadening the powers in sections 240A, \n241 and 242 as follows: \n\n\uf0a7  The power to adjourn polling is given to the Electoral Commissioner rather than \npresiding officer, with the Electoral Commissioner having power to delegate this \nresponsibility to other officers as he or she considers appropriate. \n\n\uf0a7  The power to suspend polling be retained for presiding officers, and explicitly \n\nextended to officers in charge of pre-poll voting centres. \n\n\uf0a7  Broaden these powers or establish a new power for the Electoral Commissioner to \n\nsuspend or adjourn other electoral processes during the election period, for example \nwhere an emergency may affect the process such as close of rolls, nominations, \nearly voting or scrutiny. \n\nExisting provisions  \nThe following are areas where the Electoral Act does provide limited flexibility should an \nissue arise shortly before or on polling day.  \n\nThe most recent update to these provisions occurred in 2004, when following \nrecommendation of the AEC and the Committee, section 240A was inserted and section 241 \nwas amended to cover incidents such as a bomb threat, health hazard (the examples \nprovided to the Committee by the AEC at the time included \u2018an anthrax scare\u2019 or \u2018dangerous \nanimal\u2019), fire or fire alarms or sprinklers being set off.  \n\nTemporary suspension of polling (s240A) \nSection 240A gives presiding officers the power to temporarily suspend polling at their \npolling place for physical or voter safety reasons. The section provides riots, storms, fires, \nand health hazards as specific examples. \n\nPage 7\n\n\n--- Page 9 ---\n\nThis power only allows suspension of polling that has already commenced, and only allows \nfor suspensions until later the same day. \n\nAt the 2019 federal election, polling at the Sydney Central pre-poll voting centre (PPVC) at \nCentral Railway Station, Haymarket, was temporarily suspended after a bag was left \nunattended in the vicinity of the premises. Police attended promptly and polling resumed \napproximately fifteen minutes later. \n\nAdjournment of polling (s241) \nSection 241 gives presiding officers the power to adjourn polling at their polling place for \nphysical or voter safety reasons. Like section 240A, section 241 provides riots, storms, fires, \nand health hazards as specific examples. \n\nThis power only allows for adjournment of polling from one day to the next. For an \nadjournment to continue indefinitely, the presiding officer would need to repeatedly adjourn \npolling each day.  \n\nAt the 2019 federal election polling at the Crows Nest PPVC (NSW), a person died outside \nthe PPVC shortly after voting. Polling was adjourned to the following day. \n\nAdjournment of polling in other cases (s242) \nSection 242 gives presiding officers the general power to adjourn polling if, for any cause, a \npolling booth at a polling place is not opened on polling day. \n\nThis power only allows for adjournment for up to 21 days. \n\nExtension of time for holding an election (s286) \n\nSection 286 gives \u2018the person causing the writ to be issued\u2019 (that is, depending on the \nelectoral event involved, either the Governor-General, a state Governor, or the Speaker of \nthe House of Representatives) the broad power to extend the time for holding an election in \norder for \u2018meeting any difficulty which might otherwise interfere\u2019 with the election. \n\nThis power has rarely been used and, whilst broad, is not held by any AEC officer. For these \nreasons it is unlikely that the AEC can utilise this power at short notice.    \n\nPage 8\n\n\n--- Page 10 ---\n\nResponding to the COVID-19 \npandemic \n\nThe proposals to amend legislation outlined earlier in the submission are intended to apply \nto the inherent unknowns of most conceivable emergency situations.  \n\nThis said, the COVID-19 pandemic is an example of an emergency situation that, should the \nAEC\u2019s proposals be legislated in a sufficiently swift manner, would allow the Electoral \nCommissioner to adopt modified arrangements for a future election or by-election that could \nimprove the accessibility and safety of an election that takes place during pandemics. \n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic is a highly unusual and unique emergency situation in that while its \nimpacts are evident and highly relevant to the conduct of an election, its length of duration is \nunknown. The pandemic may be with us for some time yet and its impacts for even longer.  \n\nThe AEC\u2019s experience in the delivery of the by-election in the Division of Eden-Monaro \nprovided a sense of considerations that may apply to a federal election conducted during the \npandemic.  \n\nThere are also numerous recent examples of adaptation of election laws and processes to \nthe impacts of COVID-19 nationally and internationally. Some examples are outlined at \nAttachment A. \n\nEden-Monaro by-election \n\nThe AEC demonstrated its agility and professionalism in delivering the Eden-Monaro by-\nelection in the aftermath of the 2019/20 bushfire season and the COVID-19 pandemic. \nSurveys conducted following the election of both voters and the temporary election \nworkforce highlighted their satisfaction with the voting service and safety measures \nimplemented.  \n\nThe Eden-Monaro by-election held on 4 July 2020 was the first federal electoral event to be \nheld during a pandemic in 100 years and one of the first electoral events held in Australia \nduring the COVID-19 pandemic. As such the Eden-Monaro by-election provides an \nopportunity to analyse the implications COVID-19 may have for future electoral events, \nincluding the federal election. \n\nThe AEC set out its commitment to delivering the Eden-Monaro by-election to ensure the \nintegrity of electoral services and participation, and to protect the welfare of voters, staff and \nother participants in the COVID-19 pandemic environment in the Eden-Monaro by-election \nService Plan, which is provided at Attachment B. \n\nThe AEC conducted the by-election in accordance with the Electoral Act which provides for \nin-person voting and postal voting (subject to an application). There was no legislated \n\nPage 9\n\n\n--- Page 11 ---\n\nalternative open to the AEC. However, in evaluating the viability of options (such as 100 per \ncent postal voting, use of electronic voting options or expansion of telephone voting), it was \nclear that the business process in each case would require significant review and adjustment \nin order to facilitate the possibility of using these options. That is, the AEC would not simply \nneed the flexibility to expand or contract the various voting services, but also the flexibility to \nchange components of the process to facilitate an expansion of that scale, and the \nnecessary lead time in which to do that. \n\nConsultation: Delivering a by-election in the COVID-19 environment, in an area already \nimpacted by a natural disaster, required close consultation with a great number of \nstakeholders, including Commonwealth and state government agencies.  \n\nThe breadth and depth of stakeholder consultation and liaison required to run the by-election \nwas not only fundamentally important, but required significant time and resources. The AEC \nhad to work extremely hard, be flexible and agile to establish an acceptable way for voters to \nparticipate safely. \n\nExamples of some of the unprecedented consultation and coordination undertaken within the \ncompressed timeframes of an election included: \n\n\uf0a7  working with the Commonwealth Chief Medical Officer, NSW Chief Health Officer \nand ACT Chief Medical Officer and their respective Departments, as well as the \nAustralian Federal Police and NSW Police, to determine rapidly evolving \nCommonwealth, state and territory laws and health restrictions and determine \nappropriate safety measures to conduct the by-election during the pandemic \n\n\uf0a7  seeking approval from the NSW Minister for Health to be able to hold the by-election  \n\n\uf0a7  hosting a walk-through by the Commonwealth health advisor of the counting centre \nused for the by-election and a polling place mock-up, to demonstrate COVID-safety \nmeasures in place \n\n\uf0a7  seeking approval from the Secretary of the NSW Department of Education for \n\nschools to be used as polling booths \n\n\uf0a7  seeking assistance from the NSW Minister for Local Government to work with local \n\ncouncils regarding the use of facilities as polling places  \n\n\uf0a7  working with the NSW Police Commissioner and NSW Police in relation to the \n\nactivities permitted by the Electoral Act around distribution of how-to-vote material \nand the role of scrutineers, and the AEC approach to implementing the by-election \n\n\uf0a7 \n\n\uf0a7 \n\n\uf0a7 \n\nliaison with the National Bushfire Recovery Agency and Resilience NSW to facilitate \naccess to networks involved in supporting bushfire impacted communities \n\nliaison with Services Australia, which supported the AEC in areas affected by the \nbushfires by providing information from the AEC to clients affected by the bushfires, \nand  \n\nliaison with the Chief Executive of Australia Post to ensure there would be no \ndisruption to the delivery of postal votes. \n\nThis high-level activity was supported and arrangements implemented by significant levels of \nofficer-level liaison and coordination. \n\nCommunication: The pandemic has been an incredibly stressful time for the community. \nThe AEC aimed to reduce voter anxiety in our communications campaign by showing the \nAEC was prepared. The AEC\u2019s expanded communication campaign included information \n\nPage 10\n\n\n--- Page 12 ---\n\nconcerning COVID-19 safety measures, with \u2018Plan your vote\u2019 as the key message. Public \nawareness survey results indicated: \n\n\uf0a7  at least 85 per cent of respondents were aware of the health measures in place \n\n\uf0a7  all measures made at least three-quarters of respondents feel safer \n\n\uf0a7  nearly all respondents who voted at voting centres were satisfied with the queue time \n\n(98 per cent, which in nearly all cases (96 per cent) was less than 15 minutes). \n\nAn awareness of the environmental context was key to the campaign\u2019s success. \n\nTraining: Following announcement of the by-election, the AEC had to adapt quickly to \ndevelop and deliver appropriate and relevant training to support a COVID-safe by-election. \nThis included specialised training videos and eLearning courses on proper hand hygiene, \nthe use of PPE, cleaning surfaces in a polling place and safely managing queues of voters. \nThese new training resources complement the AEC\u2019s existing suite of learning products, and \nwere produced by the AEC\u2019s specialised National Training and Education Unit in only three \nweeks to meet the timeframe of the by-election. \n\nAdditionally, the AEC\u2019s traditional face-to-face training of polling officials was successfully \ndelivered under new social distancing and hygiene requirements. The by-election \nrepresented the first time that 100 per cent of all polling officials were required to undertake \nat least some of their training online. The AEC\u2019s Learning Management System was able to \nmonitor and report on training completion, to ensure that staff had completed all mandatory \nCOVID-safe courses before commencing work. \n\nVoting services: The AEC expanded the number of pre-poll voting centres compared with \nthe 2019 federal election (13, an increase of 5), had more centres open for the maximum \npre-poll period, and adjusted polling places (71, an increase of 2) to spread the flow of voters \nand communicated these to the electorate, along with the option to postal vote. On the basis \nof advice from the Chief Medical Officer, the AEC did not conduct mobile polling for the \nevent, and instead established a dedicated team to provide advice and facilitate postal \nvoting for aged care facilities and hospitals in the electorate. \n\nCost: The COVID-19 prevention measures had a clear impact on the cost of the by-election \nevent, almost doubling the total cost, to $3.954 million. In comparison, the by-elections held \nbetween 2016 and 2019 cost on average approximately $2 million each. While the AEC is \nassessing any potential efficiencies with what was implemented, the vast majority of \nmeasures will be necessary to implement unless there is a major change in the \nenvironmental risk. The likely impact on the federal election budget is clear. \n\nThe impact on cost is primarily driven by: additional polling locations throughout the pre-poll \nperiod and on polling day; additional staff required for sanitising, queue control and vote \nissuing and counting; PPE and other hygiene materials and services; as well as new \ncommunication and training packages.  \n\nPage 11\n\n\n--- Page 13 ---\n\nImpact on turnout: The by-election had a turnout of 89 per cent, one of the best rates of \nturnout for a by-election, and only a slight drop from the 2019 federal election turnout of 93 \nper cent for Eden-Monaro.  \n\nEligible Electors \n\nTurnout \n\nInformality \n\n2019 federal \nelection \n114,147 \n\n2020 by-\nelection \n114,178 \n\n93.31% \n\n89.13% \n\n6.80% \n\n6.71% \n\n% \nchange \n0.03% \n\n-4.18% \n\n-0.09% \n\nImpact on voting trends: The number of postal votes counted was 13,340, more than \ndouble that at the federal election. The number of pre-poll ordinary votes counted was \n43,701, a moderate increase from the federal election pre-poll ordinary vote of 37,808. \n\nVote type \n\nPre-poll ordinary votes \n\nPre-poll declaration votes \n\nPolling day votes \n\nPostal votes \n\nMobile votes \n\nTotal votes \n\n2019 federal \nelection \n 37,808 \n\n2020 by-\nelection \n43,701 \n\n% \nchange \n15.59% \n\n 6,207 \n\n56,064 \n\n5,969 \n\n457 \n\n156 \n\n-97.49% \n\n44,570 \n\n-20.50% \n\n13,340  123.49% \n\n  -   \n\nN/A \n\n106,505 \n\n101,767 \n\n-4.45% \n\nInteraction between state and federal laws: As outlined further above, an emergency \nsituation may cause conflict between federal and state laws. Where the AEC is attempting to \nmanage competing stakeholder expectations, significant complexity is created. For example \nin the Eden Monaro by-election scrutiny centre, combining social distancing requirements \nwith the entitlement in the Electoral Act for candidates to be represented by one scrutineer \nper counting officer was challenging given the high number of scrutineers that presented on \nelection night. \n\nFacilitation of non-mainstream categories of electors: Careful consideration is required \nto the impact on services to groups such as overseas electors, voters in aged care facilities, \nhospitals, and remote communities. Without the ability to provide in-person voting services, \nonly postal voting is available, which is in turn also impacted by the pandemic situation and \nlikely to result in disenfranchisement of electors. For the Eden-Monaro by-election, only \n9  per cent of postal votes sent to overseas electors were admitted to the count, by \ncomparison the equivalent rate for the 2019 federal election was 33 per cent. \n\nComplexity in federal election planning: The AEC is rapidly approaching its minimum \npossible lead times to make large-scale adjustments to its polling premises footprint, staffing \nand budget estimates; to order required materials; and develop required training, procedures \nand communication packages. As such, the AEC must make some assumptions about the \npotential COVID-19 impact as at the earliest possible federal election date (August 2021) \nand plan for an event in a pandemic. \n\nPage 12\n\n\n--- Page 14 ---\n\nIt should be noted that the requirements and outcomes would certainly have been impacted \nif there were higher levels of community transmission at the time or different local legal \nrequirements in place. It was clear during the Eden-Monaro by-election and in the time \nfollowing, that the dynamic nature of the current environment adds a significant layer of \ncomplexity to planning for an approach to running a federal election in a COVID-19 \nenvironment. This would be compounded where different processes and different materials \nwere required in different states as tailoring training, materials and requirements adds \nadditional complexity, risk and cost.  \n\nData collection and analysis \n\nThe AEC has partnered with Deakin University over a number of election events to collect \ndata on process timings, run scenario modelling and use this information to help inform \ndecisions on the staffing profile, optimum staff numbers and count sizes. This modelling has \nthe dual aim of maximising efficiency and minimising queuing. In a COVID-19 scenario, \nminimising the amount of time people are gathered together in a queue is even more \nimportant.  \n\nData was collected during the Eden-Monaro by-election at a number of polling centres and \nat the counting centre. The data collected shows that issuing and counting processes took \nlonger than those from data collected at previous events. For example, on average the \nordinary vote issuing process took 16.5 seconds (or 46 per cent) longer than at the 2017 \nBennelong by-election.  \n\nIssuing times may be impacted by a number of COVID-19-related factors, for example: \n\n\uf0a7 \n\n\uf0a7 \n\nthe impact of using masks and screens on communication and efficient vote issuing \n\nissuing staff sanitising hands between voters \n\n\uf0a7  having the main queue outside and reducing the ability to use \u2018mini-queues\u2019 at each \n\nissuing point \n\n\uf0a7  handing out single-use pencils \n\n\uf0a7  cleaning issuing points and voting screens. \n\nThe AEC has extrapolated the data collected to model federal event scenarios. The table \nbelow illustrates some of the data modelling conducted to assess the impact of variables on \ntime in queue for a polling place expected to issue around 1,200 ordinary votes.  \n\nThe scenarios modelled varied the number of issuing officers, voting screens, frequency of \nhand sanitiser use, whether issuing officers provided a pencil to the elector, and whether the \nissuing point was covered during breaks taken by the issuing officer. The model then uses \ndata for elector arrival rates across the course of the day, and process timings to arrive at \nestimated average and maximum queues for each scenario. \n\nPage 13\n\n\n--- Page 15 ---\n\nTable 1 \u2013 Examples of scenarios for queue modelling, and entry queue wait time, \n1,200 ordinary votes threshold \n\nScenarios  \n\nAverage \n\nMaximum \n\nqueue \n\nqueue \n\n(minutes) \n\n(minutes) \n\nS21  4 ordinary vote issuing officers (IOs); 12 voting screens; IOs used hand \n\n23.33 \n\n55.42 \n\nsanitisation after every elector, provided pencil to elector, issuing point not \n\ncovered during breaks.  \n\nS24  4 IOs; 12 voting screens; IOs used hand sanitisation every 10th elector, \n\n15.99 \n\n45.18 \n\nprovided pencil to elector, issuing point not covered during breaks \n\nS25  4 IOs; 12 voting screens; IOs used hand sanitisation every 10th elector, did not \n\n13.12 \n\n40.15 \n\nprovide pencil to elector, issuing point not covered during breaks \n\nS26  4 IOs; 12 voting screens; IOs used hand sanitisation every 10th elector, did not \n\n3.38 \n\n16.07 \n\nprovide pencil to elector, issuing point covered during breaks \n\nS23  5 IOs; 13 voting screens; IOs used hand sanitisation after every elector, \n\n5.35 \n\n21.85 \n\nprovided pencil to elector, issuing point not covered during breaks \n\nS27  5 IOs; 13 voting screens; IOs used hand sanitisation every 10th elector, \n\n3.17 \n\n13.85 \n\nprovided pencil to elector, issuing point not covered during breaks \n\nS28  5 IOs; 13 voting screens; IOs used hand sanitisation every 10th elector, did not \n\n2.67 \n\n13.65 \n\nprovide pencil to elector, issuing point not covered during breaks \n\nS29  5 IOs; 13 voting screens; IOs used hand sanitisation every 10th elector, did not \n\n0.22 \n\n1.73 \n\nprovide pencil to elector, issuing point covered during breaks \n\nIn order to avoid queue lengths increasing to unacceptable levels, the data modelling shows \nthat it is necessary to reduce the table loading (the number of ballot papers each issuing \nofficer is expected to issue per day), thereby increasing the overall number of issuing staff. \nIn addition, the queue controller positions assigned to each polling place (which would \nnormally only be at busier locations) and new hygiene officer position would remain \nimperative.  \n\nEven in times of emergency and crisis, the AEC is of the view that evidence-based staffing \nestimations that prioritise safety and the efficient flow of voters through a polling place is \npreferred. The images from the recent United State elections of hours-long lines for voting in \nvarious states, such as in Georgia which experienced waiting times of up to 10 hours at one \nlocation on its first day of early voting, are scenes that would not be tolerated by most \nAustralians, even in extraordinary times. \n\nHaving multiple additional staff necessary at every polling location would have a significant \nimpact on cost, particularly when applied to a national electoral event. This equates to an \nestimated 30 per cent increase in polling staff required, costing approximately an additional \n$13 million.  \n\nSupply chain implications  \n\nCOVID-19 PPE procured for the Eden-Monaro by-election was appropriate and effective. \nThe addition of many new materials to AEC polling operations in such a short timeframe \n\nPage 14\n\n\n--- Page 16 ---\n\nrequired new policy development to support polling staff training requirements to create \neffective COVID safety practices and PPE use at polling locations.  \n\nProcurement and consumption analysis data from the Eden-Monaro event has been \npresented in Table 2 below. \n\nThe need for the AEC to continue to ensure its planned practices and PPE will assist it in \nproviding a safe environment for electors, staff and stakeholders needs to be of the highest \npriority for the duration of the pandemic. This is brought into sharp relief by reports this year \nfrom United States election administrators of polling officials and temporary staff falling ill \nwith COVID-19; of partial or full closure of polling and processing operations due to COVID-\n19 illness or close contact; and of the death of staff who worked at polling booths and in \nelections offices, due to COVID-19. \n\nFor the AEC, when considering supply of COVID-19 PPE for a federal election there are \nchallenges with procurement lead times, and supply chain risks to securing these items in \nthe timeframe necessary. Assurance of access to the National Medical Stockpile (controlled \nby the Department of Health) would be necessary to provide significant volumes of common \nPPE items (masks, wipes and sanitiser). This would also address the issue of consistent \nproduct quality as opposed to procuring multiple amounts of different products to meet the \noverall need. COVID-19 global demand for PPE may place supply chains originating \noverseas at risk of not being able to deliver in time for the AEC preparatory needs. \n\nAdditionally, the AEC will face significant challenges for bulk storage availability, and \nassociated costs, for these large volumes of PPE on top of the already large volumes of \nmaterial required for a federal election.  \n\nProcuring specialised materials for COVID-19 prevention may raise the cost of running a \nfederal election by in excess of $30 million. In addition, it is becoming clear that the cost of \nnormal election materials is impacted by the pandemic, where either the materials \nthemselves, or components to make them are often sourced overseas. \n\nTable 2: COVID-19 material required for the Eden-Monaro by-election \n\nProduct \n\nFacemask \n\nQuantity \n\nRequired \n\n11,000 \n\nRemarks \n\nNon-woven material \u2013 global shortage \u2013 increase \n\nin prices from China \n\nIssuing point screens -\n\n450 \n\nImproved, hardened designed product after by-\n\nSneeze screen \n\nelection experience.

We look forward to the Committee\u2019s consideration of the necessary additional \noperational supports to safeguard democracy and enable the AEC to continue to deliver high \nintegrity elections, including during an emergency situation. \n\nPage 17\n\n\n--- Page 19 ---\n\nAttachment A - Responses to \nCOVID-19 \n\nThe World Health Organisation advises that the virus that causes COVID-19 commonly \nspreads between people through direct, indirect (through contaminated objects or surfaces), \nor close contact with infected people via mouth and nose secretions.1  \n\nThis poses fundamental public health challenges for the conduct of an election, which \ninvolves large gatherings of people for campaigning, canvassing, voting and counting, and \nthe handling of equipment and materials by multiple people. As one study noted, \u2018More than \n40 points in the electoral process involve the assembly of people or transfer of objects and \ntherefore pose risks of virus transmission if no preventive measures are taken.\u20192 \n\nInitially, many governments around the world, including in Australia, took the decision to \npostpone planned elections. However, increasingly, many elections are proceeding with \ngovernments holding national or subnational elections as originally planned despite \nconcerns related to COVID-19, and holding elections that were initially postponed. \n\nThe experience of selected fellow members of the Electoral Council of Australia and New \nZealand (ECANZ) in dealing with scheduled electoral events in 2020 has shown a diversity \nof service models and regulatory approaches to dealing with election delivery in the context \nof rapidly evolving conditions and other challenges associated with the pandemic. \n\nQueensland local government elections were the first large-scale elections conducted in \nAustralia following the declaration of a pandemic, with election day falling on 28 March 2020. \n\nThe elections were delivered in a highly dynamic and uncertain environment. This included \nthe declaration of a pandemic by the WHO during the election period, and urgent legislative \nand regulatory changes impacting electoral processes that came into effect after early voting \nhad commenced on 16 March. Notably, the amended legal framework provided for a \ntemporary regulation making power, and enabled the commission to issue Directions \nconcerning the distribution or display of how-to-vote cards or other election material.3 \n\nThe election saw a significant shift in the voting patterns of the Queensland public compared \nwith previous elections:  \n\n\uf0a7  1.2 million people who voted during the two-week early voting period (500,000 in \n\n2016)  \n\n\uf0a7  470,000 postal votes were returned of the 570,000 issued (320,000 returned in 2016)  \n\n\uf0a7  37,000 people who cast a telephone vote (500 in 2016), and  \n\n1  World Health Organization, Q&A: How is COVID-19 transmitted?, www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/q-a-how-is-covid-19-\ntransmitted, accessed 11 November 2020 \n2 International Foundation for Electoral Systems, Safeguarding Health and Elections, May 2020, p. 4, \nhttps://www.ifes.org/sites/default/files/ifes_covid19_briefing_series_safeguarding_health_and_elections_may_2020.pdf, \naccessed 11 November 2020. \n3 See Public Health and Other Legislation (Public Health Emergency) Amendment Act 2020 (Qld). \n\nPage 18\n\n\n--- Page 20 ---\n\n\uf0a7  750,000 people who voted on election day at a polling booth (1.6 million in 2016). \n\nVoting for the New Zealand general election took place from Saturday 3 October to \nSaturday 17 October. The timing of the election period was delayed for four weeks on 17 \nAugust 2020 following the reemergence of COVID-19 in New Zealand.  \n\nThe legal framework for elections in New Zealand provides powers to respond to defined \nemergency situations. Sections 195 to 195E of the Electoral Act 1993 (NZ), sets out powers \nfor responding to an unforeseen or unavoidable disruption that is likely to prevent voters \nvoting at a polling place or pose a risk to the proper conduct of an election. The provisions:  \n\n\uf0a7  define the situations when provisions for managing polling disruptions may be used \n\n\uf0a7  provide for the use of alternative voting processes to respond to polling disruptions \n\n\uf0a7  provide for an adjournment power \n\n\uf0a7  outline how the effect of polling disruptions on the preliminary vote count is to be \n\nmanage. \n\nNotwithstanding these powers, Regulations were also made which provided for special \nmeasures during a pandemic.4  \n\nMeasures implemented at the election included: \n\n\uf0a7  voters were encouraged to vote early  \n\n\uf0a7  an increase in voting locations  \n\no \n\no \n\nthere were around 750 advanced voting locations (up from 485 at the 2017 \ngeneral election), and this doubled to around 1,500 voting places on the \nweekend before election day \nthere were expected to be around 2,500 voting booths on election day (up \nfrom 2,378 in 2017) 5 \n\n\uf0a7 \n\n\uf0a7 \n\nthose who were unable to get to a voting place could apply for a postal vote, or ask \nsomeone to bring them their voting papers6 \n\ntelephone dictation voting, normally only available to voters with particular disabilities, \nfor use by voters who were in COVID-19 related managed isolation and quarantine \nfacilities.   \n\nPreliminary election results reported indicated:  \n\n\uf0a7  over 60 per cent of the 3.2 million enrolled voters cast an advance vote (1,976,996, \n\nup from 1,240,740 in 2017)  \n\n\uf0a7 \n\nthe largest number of advance votes received was on Saturday 10 October, a week \nbefore the election.7 \n\nElection day for the Queensland state election occurred on Saturday 31 October 2020. \n\n4 See COVID-19 Public Health Response (Election and Referendums) Order 2020 (NZ). \n5 Jason Walls, Election officials are expecting the highest early voting turnout in history this election, New Zealand Herald, \n27  July 2020 2:20pm, https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=12351328, accessed 11 November \n2020. \n6 New Zealand Electoral Commission, 2020 General Election: COVID-19, https://vote.nz/voting/2020-general-election/covid-19/, \naccessed 10 November 2020.  \n7 Radio New Zealand, Election 2020: Advance votes total just under 2 million, 17 October 2020, \nhttps://www.rnz.co.nz/news/political/428576/election-2020-advance-votes-total-just-under-2-million, accessed 30 October 2020.  \n\nPage 19\n\n\n--- Page 21 ---\n\nDue to the ongoing risk posed by COVID-19, the Electoral Commission of Queensland \nadapted its election delivery model. The model was supported by legislative enhancements \nresulting from passage of the Electoral and Other Legislation (Accountability, Integrity and \nOther Matters) Amendment Act 2020. This Act included amendments to the Electoral Act \n1992 (Qld) providing extra flexibility in the statutory framework for the elections including:  \n\n\uf0a7 \n\nflexibility to change dates for election milestones contained in the writ  \n\n\uf0a7  ability for the ECQ to issue notices that change timeframes for postal vote \n\napplications and expand eligibility for telephone voting  \n\n\uf0a7  power for the ECQ to issue directions regulating the handing out of election materials \n\nor how-to-vote cards near polling place and the activity of scrutineers, and  \n\n\uf0a7  ability to declare certain classes of voters or electorates to automatically receive a \n\npostal vote by regulation. \n\nMeasures in place for the election included: \n\n\uf0a7 \n\nthe election was conducted over an election period rather than focussing on an \nelection day  \n\n\uf0a7  expanded early voting options were available across the two-week early voting \n\nperiod, with extra centres established, and extended operating hours, including from \n9am to 4pm on the Saturday prior to election day  \n\n\uf0a7  electors were, for the first time, able to apply for a postal vote before the issue of the \n\nwrit with applications opening from 14 September 2020 \n\n\uf0a7  declaration of additional categories of electors eligible for telephone voting, and  \n\n\uf0a7  special arrangements for postal voting in aged care and rehabilitation facilities which \n\nwould usually receive a mobile polling service. \n\nWhile the election count is still being finalised, pre-poll and postal votes will exceed the \nvolumes received at the March 2020 election, with many more people casting their vote \nbefore election day than on election day.  \n\nBeyond ECANZ, Elections Canada is presently engaging with the Canadian Parliament in \nrelation to legislative responses that may assist it deliver an accessible, safe and secure \nelection. \n\nKey elements of its suggested changes, which it proposes to apply to the next general \nelection only, include a focus on: \n\n\uf0a7  extending the voting period, shifting polling day from one 12-hour period on a \n\nMonday to 8 hours per day on a Saturday and a Sunday \n\n\uf0a7 \n\nflexibility in approach to aged care facility voting, enabling the Chief Electoral Officer \nto prescribe the timing and manner in which voting occurs at these facilities \n\n\uf0a7  extending the existing \u2018adaptation power\u2019 in section 17 of the Canada Elections Act to \n\ninclude all areas within the Chief Electoral Officer\u2019s mandate. \n\nPage 20\n\n\n--- Page 22 ---\n\nAttachment B \u2013 Eden-Monaro by-\nelection Service Plan \n\nPage 21\n\n\n--- Page 23 ---\n\n28 May 2020 \n\nEden-Monaro \nby-election \nService Plan \n\nMay 2020\n\n\n--- Page 24 ---\n\nForeword  \n\nThe AEC is committed to providing the highest standard of electoral services for the Eden-\nMonaro by-election. During the COVID-19 pandemic this includes a range of safety \nmeasures for voters, AEC staff and other participants.  \n\nWe have introduced a range of COVID-19 safety measures at voting venues and also \nthrough the entire by-election process, including the receipt and declaration of nominations, \nthe management of election materials and at our counting centre.  \n\nThe operating model for this by-election includes social distancing and hygiene measures \nthat conform with federal and local health advice and are also within the legislative \nframework of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918. The infection-control advice the AEC is \nfollowing has been provided by the Australian Government\u2019s Chief Medical Officer, and \nrelevant NSW and ACT health authorities. \n\nIt is also important to note these measures, which must be enacted to protect the \ncommunity, will inevitably slow the voting process. Whilst we are implementing measures to \ntry and reduce this impact, the AEC thanks all electors and participants for their patience and \nadherence to the new measures in the polling place and at our count centre. \n\nThe counting of votes will also take longer due to the measures in place in polling places and \nat our counting centre. The expected increase in postal and pre-poll votes cast will also \nimpact the speed of the count, noting the legislative requirement to wait 13 days after \nelection day for the return of postal votes.  \n\nAs a result, it is likely to take longer to formally declare a final result in this by-election \ncompared with previous federal by-elections but, as per our normal practice, the AEC will do \neverything possible to provide an indicative result on polling night. \n\nThe AEC is committed to continuous improvement. This service plan outlines the key \nelection services and standards that will underpin the AEC\u2019s delivery of the 2020 Eden-\nMonaro by-election during a pandemic. \n\nShould you have any comments on the service plan or the AEC\u2019s delivery on these \ncommitments, I would ask you to take the time to let us know through our online enquiry \nform so we can consider your feedback as we continue to improve the delivery of election \nservices. \n\nTom Rogers  \nElectoral Commissioner \n\nPage 1 \n\nEden-Monaro by-election Service Plan\n\n\n--- Page 25 ---\n\nCOVID-19 related measures  \nfor the Eden-Monaro by-election \n\nThe operating model for the by-election will see measures introduced that conform with \nfederal and local health advice and are applied within the Commonwealth Electoral Act \n1918. The infection-control advice the AEC is following has been provided by the Australian \nGovernment\u2019s Chief Medical Officer, and reviewed by NSW and ACT health authorities. \n\nIt is also important to note these measures, which must be put in place to protect the \ncommunity, will inevitably slow the voting process. Whilst we are implementing measures to \ntry and reduce this impact, the AEC thanks all electors and participants for their patience and \nadherence to the new measures in the polling places and at our count centre. \n\nThe counting of votes will also take longer due to the measures in place in our polling places \nand at our counting centre. The expected increase in postal and pre-poll votes cast will also \nimpact the speed of the count, noting also the legislative requirement to wait 13 days after \nelection day for the return of postal votes. As a result, it is likely to take longer to formally \ndeclare a final result in this by-election compared with previous federal by-elections but, as \nper our normal practice, the AEC will do everything possible to provide an indicative result \non polling night. \n\nThis document outlines the ways in which the key processes in the operation of the by-\nelection will be modified or enhanced.  \n\nTaking nominations  \n\nPeople wishing to nominate for the by-election will need to make an appointment with the \nDivisional Returning Officer for Eden-Monaro before attending the AEC office to lodge their \nnomination forms. At the office, hand sanitiser will be available at the entrance, on all \nmeeting tables, and on the way out. AEC staff may wear surgical masks, and social \ndistancing of 1.5 metres will be in place wherever possible between staff and nominees.  \n\nWhere possible AEC staff will also seek to minimise the amount of back-and-forth handling \nof forms. Contactless Eftpos facilities will be available for candidates to pay their nomination \nfee. \n\nBallot draw \n\nSocial-distancing rules will apply to everybody attending the ballot draw and seating will be \nappropriately spaced. Hand sanitiser will be at the entrance and exit of the venue. \n\nAEC staff performing the ballot draw will observe necessary personal hygiene measures and \nsanitise the equipment used. \n\nPage 2 \n\nEden-Monaro by-election Service Plan\n\n\n--- Page 26 ---\n\nDuring training \n\nOur online training suite has been enhanced to include a new online training module on the \nrequired health measures put in place for this by-election. This will be mandatory for all AEC \nstaff and temporary election workers working at this by-election. Where AEC staff conduct \nface-to-face training, social-distancing rules will be observed and all of the health measures \nthat will be applied throughout the by-election will also be observed throughout the \ncorresponding practical exercises. Hand sanitiser will be available on arrival and exit, and \nparticipants will wash or sanitise their hands before and after each practical exercise. \n\nVoting for residents of aged care facilities and hospital patients \n\nThe AEC is very conscious of the health and safety of voters during the by-election; \nparticularly those who are potentially vulnerable to infection. Accordingly, we have adopted \nspecial measures to protect residents of aged care facilities and hospitals in the Eden-\nMonaro electorate during these extraordinary times, whilst still ensuring they can exercise \ntheir right to vote. Based on medical advice, the AEC will be providing effective alternatives \nto mobile polling (which are normally a feature of electoral events). Specifically, the AEC has \nestablished a support team for these facilities and has already provided enrolment forms and \ngeneral postal vote applications for residents to complete and return to the AEC. Residents \nof aged care facilities and hospitals will have the option to either vote via a postal vote \ndelivered directly to their facility; telephone voting for those who are blind or low vision; or by \nattending a polling location (depending on their personal circumstances), which will have \nhealth and safety measures in place.  \n\nThe AEC will also maintain ongoing contact with aged care facilities and relevant hospitals in \nthe Division of Eden-Monaro to provide support, answer questions and deliver additional \nenrolment and postal vote application forms, if needed.  \n\nBlind and Low Vision \n\nVoters who are blind or have low vision can cast a vote in secret by telephone from any \nlocation for the Eden-Monaro by-election. \n\nTelephone voting is a simple two-step process, voters who are blind or have low vision will \nbe invited to register for a telephone vote by calling a dedicated 1800 number for this \nelection. They will not need to give their name when they vote using the telephone voting \nservice. Their registration number and pin will be used to mark their name off the electoral \nroll, ensuring the voter\u2019s identity remains secret. \n\nPostal voting \n\nPostal voting will be an important voting option available to eligible Eden-Monaro electors. \nPostal voting helps minimise contact and movement, and given the COVID-19 environment, \nit is anticipated that a greater number of voters will meet the eligibility criteria under the \nlegislation to apply for a postal vote in this by-election. \n\nPage 3 \n\nEden-Monaro by-election Service Plan\n\n\n--- Page 27 ---\n\nVoting at polling places \n\nIf on arrival voters are not able to immediately enter the \npolling place, they will be required to queue outside \nwhere social-distancing rules will be in place. Extra \nqueue controllers that have been appropriately trained \nin social-distancing rules and the traditional \u201csix-metre \nrule\u201d regarding campaigners will be outside the polling \nplace to ensure adherence to these important \nmeasures. \n\nThe number of voters entering a polling place will be \ncounted at the door to limit the number of people inside \nthe polling place at any one time. Hand sanitiser will be \navailable at the entrance to the polling place and at \neach ballot-paper issuing point and when exiting the \npolling place. Signage about hygiene and social \ndistancing will be prominent in the polling place for \nvoters and staff.  \n\nWhere possible a \u201csneeze shield\u201d will be installed at all ballot-paper issuing points, and \nissuing tables will be sprayed regularly with sanitising spray throughout the day and \nwhenever issuing staff are rotated. Voters will be encouraged to bring their own pencil or pen \nto the polling place but electors will also be offered a single-use pencil when handed their \nballot papers. \n\nVoting screens will separated by a distance of 1.5 metres and the plastic writing surface \ninserted into the voting screen will be regularly cleaned with sanitising spray throughout \npolling day. \n\nAEC staff may wear surgical masks and will under no circumstances share their bibs or \nlanyards with other staff. Bio-hazard bags will be used for the disposal of surgical masks, \ngloves and cleaning cloth waste.  \n\nPhoto opportunities of the inside of a polling place will only be allowed when there is a \nsufficiently low number of voters present so social distancing can be maintained, and when \nthe Officer-in-Charge approves. \n\nCampaigning at polling places \n\nWhilst the AEC has no legislative jurisdiction or responsibility for campaigners outside six \nmetres of the entrance to the polling place, we acknowledge that the current COVID-19 \nenvironment may impact on their ability to hand our how-to-vote cards as they ordinarily \nwould for any other federal electoral event. Parties and candidates will need to ensure that \nthose campaigning on their behalf near a polling venue have fully informed themselves of \nNSW Government health restrictions and laws in place regarding social distancing, and that \nthey abide by these directives. \n\nAcknowledging the challenges faced by parties and candidates for this by-election, the AEC \nhas decided to assist parties and candidates by seeking to collect the details of all \ncandidate\u2019s official campaign website addresses at the time of nomination. The AEC will \n\nPage 4 \n\nEden-Monaro by-election Service Plan\n\n\n--- Page 28 ---\n\nprovide a link to these websites which will be available on the AEC website alongside the \ncandidate\u2019s details. \n\nCounting on election night at polling places \n\nAfter 6pm, when the counting commences at polling places, hand sanitiser for all polling \nplace officials and scrutineers will be at the polling place entry point, at each sorting and \ncounting table, and at the exit to the polling place.  \n\nBallot boxes will be cleaned with sanitising spray before they are opened for counting on the \ntables. Staff will sanitise their hands immediately before and after they handle ballot-box \ntags. \n\nSurgical masks may be worn by both staff and scrutineers, and no sharing of bibs or \nlanyards will be allowed. If practicable, \u201csneeze shields\u201d may be used at each counting and \nsorting table to separate scrutineers from counting staff. \n\nThere will be signs outlining the hygiene and social distancing rules, and those who do not \nadhere to the rules will be requested to leave.  \n\nThe area used for polling and counting at each polling place will be fully cleaned after \nelection night. \n\nCounting at AEC out-posted centres \n\nHand sanitiser will be available at the entry and exit of the out-posted centre (OPC), at each \nsorting and counting table and in break-out areas.  \n\nThe outside surfaces of election materials returned to the OPC \u2013 including ballot boxes \ntransported on election night from pre-poll voting centres \u2013 will be cleaned with sanitising \nspray on arrival. \n\nBallot boxes will be cleaned with sanitising spray before opening, and staff will wash or \nsanitise their hands after handling ballot-box tags, and before and after each count of ballot \npapers. Surgical masks may be worn both by staff and scrutineers and, if practicable, \n\u201csneeze shields\u201d will be used at each counting and sorting table to separate scrutineers from \ncounting staff. \n\nThe OPC will be set up with prominent hygiene signage and 1.5-metre standard markings on \nthe floor. There will be regular cleaning of surfaces, equipment and break-out areas during \noperational hours. Only single-use water bottles will be allowed, all plates and cutlery must \nbe disposable, and there will be no provision for the serving of coffee or tea inside. \n\nAll equipment used for scrutiny will be cleaned before installing and it will also be regularly \ncleaned during use and before return. Additional Security Officers and Hygiene Officers will \nbe present in the OPC to ensure everyone\u2019s safety and adherence to the health measures. \nThey will be wearing distinctive bibs.  \n\nDeep cleaning of the OPC will occur overnight and at the conclusion of the counting. \nBiohazard bags will be used to dispose of all waste from the clearing process.  \n\nPage 5 \n\nEden-Monaro by-election Service Plan\n\n\n--- Page 29 ---\n\nWhen counting postal votes \n\nThe outside of all transport containers used by Australia Post or couriers will be sprayed with \nsanitising spray prior to opening. \n\nHand sanitiser will be regularly applied by staff before opening batches of postal-vote \nenvelopes and the extraction of ballot papers. Staff will also wash or sanitise their hands \nimmediately before and after each count or when they handle batches of ballot papers.  \n\nSurgical masks should be worn by both staff and scrutineers.  \n\nAt the declaration of the poll \n\nSocial-distancing rules will apply to all in attendance and seating will be appropriately \nspaced. Hand sanitiser will be at the entrance and exit of the venue. \n\nPage 6 \n\nEden-Monaro by-election Service Plan\n\n\n--- Page 30 ---\n\nAchieving the AEC Service Standards  \n\nThe AEC is committed to upholding five key service standards. \n\nThe AEC will support effective participation in the Eden-Monaro by-election by ensuring \ninformation provided to the voting public and candidates is timely, accurate, comprehensive \nand easy to understand. \n\nThe AEC will conduct a public information and education campaign and will deliver an official \nguide for the by-election to households across the division.

Eligible voters receive a unique registration number and a self-chosen PIN, along with instructions to view ballot paper information.\n2.  **Voting Service (Phone)**: Voters call a dedicated voting line, providing their registration number and PIN to a Service Officer (SO) to maintain anonymity. The SO conducts real-time checks to ensure the voter has not previously voted and identifies the correct electorate.

It details a \"Customer Journey\" beginning with the voter checking the AEC website for eligibility, registering online (providing personal details for identity and electoral roll verification, answering eligibility questions, choosing a PIN, and receiving a registration number). If eligible, the voter then calls a dedicated voting line, provides their registration number and PIN to a Service Officer, who then \"records the voter's preference on the ballot papers.\" The Service Officer physically handles ballot papers for the identified electorate, marks the voter off the electoral roll, and places the ballot papers in an envelope into a ballot box. In cases of ineligibility, the voter is advised to seek alternate voting options.\n\n**Analysis from an Objectivist Perspective:**\n\n**Reason:**\nThe document reflects a profound contradiction to reason by presenting a highly convoluted, manual, and inefficient process for a modern electoral system, especially for an \"experienced voter\" like \"Wendy\" who \"has a computer at home.\" The requirement for a Service Officer to *physically record* a voter's preferences on *physical ballot papers* and then place them into a box, rather than utilizing readily available secure digital solutions (as implied by the FOI overview's critique of the \"rejection of secure online voting\"), is an **irrational diversion of productive capital** and effort. It demonstrates a preference for archaic, labor-intensive methods over technologically superior, efficient, and potentially more secure alternatives. This choice, justified perhaps by abstract notions of \"trust\" or \"safety\" (as per the FOI overview), comes at the expense of practical reason and cost-effectiveness. The multi-step registration process, with a 10-minute delay for receiving a registration number, adds unnecessary **bureaucratic obstacles** that create friction for the individual.\n\n**Individualism:**\nThis document operates within the framework of **compulsory voting**, which from an Objectivist perspective, is an act of **forced altruism**. It demands individuals (even those sick and isolating) sacrifice their personal choice and time to a collective \"duty,\" rather than allowing them the individual freedom to abstain or prioritize their health. The AEC's elaborate \"Customer Journey\" diagram treats citizens not as sovereign individuals with inherent rights, but as components to be processed through a state-mandated system. The most egregious aspect concerning individualism is that the voter does not directly interact with their ballot; instead, a **Service Officer records the voter's preference on the ballot papers.** This fundamentally undermines individual agency and introduces a mediator for a core personal act, eroding the direct exercise of one's political choice and control. The \"real time check to ensure the voter hasn't previously voted\" and marking the voter off the roll further underscore the state's totalizing control over individual participation, rather than protecting individual rights to free association or non-association.\n\n**Free Enterprise:**\nThe system described is inherently antithetical to free enterprise principles. It represents an extensive, centrally planned government operation that necessitates significant taxpayer funding for salaries, training, infrastructure, and the management of a complex, manual process. This aligns directly with the FOI overview's critique of \"billions extracted from taxpayers for bureaucratic micromanagement and archaic processes.\" Instead of allowing the efficiency and innovation of a free market to potentially develop diverse, secure, and voluntary voting solutions, the government imposes a monopolistic, costly, and inefficient system. This **suppression of productive achievement** occurs by diverting capital and labor from wealth-creating activities in the private sector to fund a state-run bureaucracy that could be streamlined or made obsolete by market-driven innovation. The detailed process flow itself is a testament to the inefficiencies characteristic of central planning, which prioritizes control and compliance over innovation and value creation.", "model": "gemini-2.5-flash", "generated_at": "2025-06-24T02:16:00.546186", "source_hash": "fb530bfd58a34d157f3dc3bd23a41e58410aa94a78b655d3bd43d41a09f36954", "raw_response_path": "data/llm_responses/LEX2846__per_file__objectivist__Doc 02 - Customer Journey for AEC Covid Voting DRAFT v7.pdf__20250624T021600.json", "output_tokens": 845, "prompt_tokens": 1319, "total_tokens": 3834, "summary_length": 4639}}, "filename": "Doc 02 - Customer Journey for AEC Covid Voting DRAFT v7.pdf", "download_path": "/foi_assets/LEX2846/Doc 02 - Customer Journey for AEC Covid Voting DRAFT v7.pdf", "extracted_text": "\n\n--- Page 1 ---\n\nAUSTRALIAN \n\nELECTORAL \n\nCOMMISSION \n\nPhone Voting for \n\nCOVID Isolating \n\ncustomers\n\nMeet Wendy\n\nWendy is an experienced \nvoter.

The Electoral Commissioner has the authority to deem this method unfeasible and suspend its provision, which would not invalidate election results.\n*   **Eligibility and Registration:** An individual is entitled to register for telephone voting if they are on an approved voter list, have not already voted, became a \"coronavirus affected individual\" within four days of polling day (due to a positive COVID-19 test or Minister-specified matter), and are directed to self-isolate/quarantine by a public health authority, which prevents them from attending a polling place. Registration involves providing personal details, making declarations (e.g., not having voted, reason for isolation), and obtaining a registration number and Personal Identification Number (PIN).\n*   **Telephone Voting Process:** Eligible registered voters call an authorised call centre. A call centre operator verifies their identity using the registration number and PIN, asks for required declarations, and then assists the voter to cast their vote by telephone. The voter orally dictates their preferences, which the operator marks on a physical ballot paper. The preferences are then read back to the voter for affirmation, and the ballot is placed in a secure envelope and ballot-box. Voters are informed about other voting methods (polling place, pre-poll, postal). The regulations permit informal voting by telephone. Assistance for voters is allowed if declared, with specific exemptions for National Relay Service and interpreter services.\n*   **Integrity and Scrutiny Measures:**\n    *   **Scrutineer Observation:** Candidates can appoint scrutineers to attend authorised call centres to monitor call centre operators, including listening to calls (with voter awareness), and to raise objections to voting procedures or ballot paper marking.\n    *   **Prevention of Double Voting:** A record is made when a secure telephone vote is cast. During scrutiny, ballot papers are excluded if the voter's name is marked as having already voted by other means (e.g., pre-poll, postal).\n    *   **Security:** Offences are established for false/misleading declarations, interfering with voters or their votes, communicating about votes, attempting to discover how a voter voted, voting more than once (strict liability for each secure telephone vote), and destroying or interfering with voting hardware or software.\n    *   **Transparency:** A representation of the ballot paper must be available on the AEC website, and scrutiny results are published, identifying secure telephone votes by division.\n*   **Operational Flexibility:** The Electoral Commissioner can temporarily suspend telephone polling due to unforeseen circumstances like health hazards or safety concerns.\n\n**Relevance to the FOI Request (LEX2846):**\n\nThis document is central to FOI request LEX2846 as it **is** the \"Commonwealth Electoral (COVID Enfranchisement) Regulations 2022\" directly referenced.

The regulations detail the process for an individual to register as a secure telephone voter, including providing personal and sensitive medical information (such as test reference numbers and self-isolation directives), and the method for casting a vote by verbally instructing a call centre operator, who then marks a physical ballot paper. It outlines procedures for identity verification, ballot handling, and scrutiny, including the explicit prohibition of audio recording of the vote itself and a requirement for individuals to retain medical records for 40 days.\n\nWithin the context of the FOI request, this document exemplifies a chilling expansion of government control, assaulting individual rights and productive achievement.\n\n**Contradiction of Objectivist Values:**\n\n*   **Reason:** The document reflects a profound contradiction of reason by preferring an inefficient, cumbersome, and inherently less secure \"telephone voting\" system over potentially more rational, secure, and direct digital methods like online voting (as hinted by the FOI overview's mention of \"rejection of secure online voting\"). The process requires individuals to verbally dictate their preferences to a third-party operator, who then manually marks a physical ballot, introduces multiple points of potential error, and lacks the direct, verifiable record that a digital system could provide. The explicit prohibition on audio recording the actual vote (Section 16(8)) further undermines transparency and verifiability, replacing objective record-keeping with a reliance on the integrity of government agents. The extensive manual handling of physical ballots after a telephone interaction (sorting, forwarding, scrutinizing) represents an irrational and archaic bureaucratic workaround in the digital age.\n*   **Individualism:** This document directly contradicts individualism by facilitating what the FOI overview terms \"forced altruism.\" Given Australia's compulsory voting laws, these regulations ensure that even medically compromised individuals, who are already under government health directives to isolate, are still compelled to participate in the electoral process. The system prioritizes the \"collective duty\" of maintaining voter participation over the individual's right to abstain or to maintain their privacy and autonomy during a health crisis. The mandatory disclosure of private medical information (test results, isolation directives, and the requirement to retain such records for 40 days per Section 9(4)) for the purpose of voting constitutes an egregious overreach into personal autonomy and privacy, forcing individuals to surrender sensitive data to the state for a perceived collective benefit. The voter's loss of direct control over marking their own ballot, instead relying on a government operator, further erodes individual agency.\n*   **Free Enterprise & Productive Achievement:** The elaborate, centrally planned infrastructure of \"authorised call centres,\" the numerous bureaucratic steps for registration and voting, and the labor-intensive manual processing of \"telephone ballots\" represent significant bureaucratic obstacles and an immense diversion of productive capital. This system, financed by taxpayers (\"billions extracted from taxpayers\" as per the FOI overview), is inherently inefficient and costly. It signifies a \"nanny state\" approach that imposes a highly regulated, inefficient solution rather than leveraging private sector innovation or respecting individual choice. The resources spent on developing, implementing, and running this complex, archaic system detract from more productive, value-creating economic activities, thus suppressing overall productive achievement in favor of bureaucratic micromanagement.\n\n**Evidence of Specific Obstacles/Suppression:**\n\n*   **Bureaucratic Obstacles:**\n    *   **Mandatory Disclosure of Private Medical Information:** Section 9(1)(c) requires individuals to provide \"a reference number for the direction to... self-isolate or quarantine\" or \"a reference number or serial number for the test on which the individual tested positive.\" Section 9(4) mandates individuals \"keep... a copy of a document containing the number; or a record of the test or of the test results\" for 40 days.\n    *   **Complex Verification & Manual Processing:** Sections 11, 13, 14, 22, and 23 detail a multi-step verification process (PINs, registration numbers, personal questions), the manual marking of physical ballots by call centre operators, placing them into specific envelopes, sorting them by division, and then a complex manual scrutiny process involving cross-referencing against certified lists *without opening the ballot envelope first*.\n    *   **Prohibition on Audio Recording:** Section 16(8) explicitly states: \"An audio recording must not be made of a request to vote by a secure telephone vote or of a vote by a secure telephone vote,\" eliminating an objective record of the actual vote.\n*   **Forced Altruism:** The entire premise of \"COVID Enfranchisement\" within a compulsory voting system means the regulations are designed to ensure citizens fulfill a \"collective duty\" to vote, even when physically incapacitated, reinforcing the idea that individual choice is secondary to state-mandated participation (Section 8(1) \"An individual must register as a secure telephone voter in order to vote by a secure telephone vote\").\n*   **Suppression of Productive Achievement:**\n    *   **Inefficient System:** The entire telephone voting and manual ballot handling process, as described, is a highly inefficient use of resources (time, labor, capital). It represents a preference for a centrally planned, costly, and unwieldy solution over more streamlined, technologically advanced (e.g., secure online voting) alternatives.\n    *   **Diversion of Resources:** The \"establishment of one or more call centres\" (Section 25(1)) and the extensive staff and procedures required to manage this system divert significant productive capital and human effort from wealth-creating sectors to a bureaucratic function.\n    *   **Lack of Innovation:** The detailed commitment to a physical/verbal system, as opposed to a genuinely digital one, implies a reluctance to embrace technological solutions that could offer greater efficiency and autonomy, consistent with the FOI overview's critique of the \"rejection of secure online voting.\"", "model": "gemini-2.5-flash", "generated_at": "2025-06-24T02:16:27.102805", "source_hash": "1f3e7032d0efccf048069128bffc35a912c685b6e92fc7d767a3786da09df102", "raw_response_path": "data/llm_responses/LEX2846__per_file__objectivist__Doc 14 -

Voters will be making a legal declaration about their identity, as they do when \nvoting in person or by post, and that they have not previously voted in this election.  \n\n\u2022  Previously, telephone voting was limited to voters who are blind or have low vision with just \n\nover 2,000 votes taken via telephone in 2019.  \n\n\u2022 \n\nIt is an emergency measure only and there will likely be long wait times to vote with this \nservice.   \n\n\u2022  Anyone who is able to visit a polling place should do so. There are more COVID-19 safety \nmeasures in place than your trip to the local shops \u2013 so you can feel safe to turn up and \nvote.  \n\nHow secure telephone voting works \n\nHow will telephone voting work? \n\nThere\u2019s two steps for secure telephone voting. \n\nFirst, people register to use the service on the AEC website. Voters will need to provide \nevidence of being COVID-19 positive and make a declaration about their eligibility.  \n\nOnce the registration form has been submitted, people will get a registration number sent by \nSMS or email. When they call to cast their vote, people will quote this registration number \nrather than their name and address to protect the secrecy of their vote. \n\nIf people don\u2019t have internet access, they can register over the phone. But we expect the vast \nmajority to register online. \n\nWe\u2019re asking people to visit the AEC website and look at an image of the ballot papers and \nconsider their preferences before calling to vote. This will help make the voting process quicker \nand reduce wait times for the service. \n\nThen they will call 1800 413 960. They quote their registration number and a call centre \noperator will record the vote. \n\nHow do people prove they\u2019re COVID-19 positive? \n\nPeople can only use the telephone voting service if they have registered their positive COVID-19 \ntest \u2013 either a PCR or RAT \u2013 with their state or territory health authority. They\u2019ll also need to \nprovide evidence of their PCR, such as date and time of positive test result, or evidence of their \nRAT, such as serial number.\n\n\n--- Page 2 ---\n\nHow can close contacts vote? \n\nClose contacts no longer need to isolate. This means they can attend a polling place to vote in \nperson. We expect they will follow local health authority guidelines and take appropriate \nCOVID-19 safety measures. \n\nWhat happens if a close contact has COVID-19 symptoms? \n\nThe AEC is recommending people plan their vote. If people don\u2019t think they will be able to \nvote in person on election day, they may be eligible to apply for a postal vote or attend one of \nour early voting centres. If a family member has COVID-19 in the week before the election, \nclose contacts may consider voting early in case they become symptomatic. \n\nHow will COVID-19 positive people know about the service? \n\nThe AEC is running a voter services campaign, which explains to people their voting options if \nthey don\u2019t think they will be able to vote in person on election day. This is available in up to 33 \nlanguages. \n\nIn addition, everyone who registers a positive COVID-19 test result with their state or territory \ngovernment will receive information on how to vote while in isolation. State and territory \nCOVID-19 web pages and call centres will also direct people to the AEC website to check their \nvoting options. \n\nWhat are the operating hours? \n\nOnline registration  \nOpens \nCloses \nPhone registration \n\nPhone voting  \n\nWednesday 18 May  \nSaturday 21 May  \nThursday 19 May   \nFriday 20 May \nSaturday 21 May \nThursday 19 May \nFriday 20 May \nSaturday 21 May \n\n6.01pm AEST  \n4pm AEST \n8.30am to 5.30pm local time \n8.30am to 5.30pm local time \n8am local time to 4pm AEST \n8.30am to 5.30pm local time \n8.30am to 6pm local time \n8am to 6pm local time \n\nIf a registered COVID-19 positive telephone voter is on the line when voting closes at 6pm on \nelection day they will be able to cast their vote, just as is the case for people in the queue at \n6pm at an election day polling place.  \n\nIntegrity of the service \n\nDoes this open up the possibility of people voting twice? \n\nNo. As part of the registration process, the voter\u2019s name will be marked off the roll in real time. \nIf the voter has already voted they will not be able to register. \n\nVoters also have to make a declaration when they call to vote that they haven\u2019t voted before in \nthis election. \n\nHow is the AEC ensuring electoral integrity given there will be non-AEC call centres taking votes? \n\nAll policies, procedures and training materials have been developed by the AEC in line with \nour existing election and call centre management procedures. As you\u2019d expect, they\u2019re \nstandardised, robust, and align with the electronically assisted voting provisions in the \nElectoral Act. \n\nIf pushed \nAll staff working on the call centre are employees of the Australia Public Service and have \nundertaken specific training for this service. They also must have signed a Political Neutrality \ndisclosure, and there are offences in the Regulation and lawful declarations that the elector \nneeds to make. Any breach is a criminal offence.\n\n\n--- Page 3 ---\n\nHow is the service scrutineered? \n\nCandidates and party-appointed scrutineers can observe the telephone voting process, as is the \ncase with every voting process we deliver. This is an important part of the transparency of \nAustralia\u2019s election delivery. Voters can request a scrutineer not to observe their phone call, if \nthat\u2019s their preference. \n\nThe ballot paper handling requirements in call centres will be subject to the same stringent \nballot paper handling and reconciliation requirements as in-person polling places.  \n\nVotes will only be counted following secure return to the relevant divisional offices, which is \nalso conducted under scrutineer observation. \n\nHow will the secure telephone votes be counted? \n\nAfter the close of voting on election day, all the envelopes will be sorted, reconciled and \npacked for secure dispatch to their home division. There, they\u2019ll be receipted, opened and the \nballot papers counted. \n\nOperation of the service \n\nWho is delivering the call centre? \n\nThe secure telephone voting service is being managed by the Australian Electoral Commission, \nusing a number of Commonwealth department call centres.  \n\nOperators, like all people involved in the delivery of the election, are required to sign a political \nneutrality declaration \u2013 a statement that they will undertake their duties with impartiality.  \n\nHow many people do you think will cast a vote by phone? \n\nCOVID-19 case numbers continue to fluctuate. We\u2019re working closely with the Department of \nHealth to model expected demand.  \n\nIf pushed \n\nThe one thing we know is that COVID-19 is unpredictable. In saying that, if people are tracking \nthe number of daily COVID-positive case numbers this should give them an idea of the number \nof calls we\u2019re expecting.  \n\nWhile experts are predicting numbers to plateau, we\u2019re building a service that will cater for \nabove the expected demand, so that there\u2019s coverage if a new variant emerges or numbers \nunexpectedly rise in the week prior to the election. \n\nIf further pushed \n\nWe\u2019ll have approximately 7000 operators for this service. While a significant delivery scale has \nbeen stood up in a short time frame, we\u2019ve been very upfront that the nature of the service \nwill mean people may experience a wait.  \n\nHow many how people voted by phone? \n\n(From Sunday) XX people registered to vote by phone. We\u2019re still reconciling how many then \ncalled to cast their vote by phone. \n\nLast updated: 11 May 2022 \n\nClearance: Kath Gleeson"}, {"type": "pdf", "output_file_path": "/downloaded_originals/Document No. 3.pdf", "content_files": [], "extracted_text_path": "/extracted_texts/LEX2846_Document No. 3.txt", "ai_summaries": {"balanced": {"text": "The document, \"KEY MESSAGING 2022 federal election telephone voting system,\" details the Australian Electoral Commission's (AEC) emergency telephone voting service for voters in isolation or quarantine due to public health orders during the 2022 federal election.

This signifies a deliberate reduction in mobile polling for these groups, necessitating a greater reliance on postal voting, aligning with the FOI request's scope.\n*   **Logistical & Financial Challenges:** It addresses logistical and financial considerations for managing increased postal voting. The policy details the use of a \"Service Provider\" for efficient PVA scanning and data capture, and mandates AEC divisional offices to have \"sufficient staff\" and resources for processing (p.7), reflecting the staffing and resource challenges noted in the FOI request. Furthermore, it outlines provisions for \"alternative non-Australia Post delivery options\" (p.9) for postal votes, including cost thresholds and approval processes for special delivery, indicating proactive measures to mitigate logistical hurdles and manage associated financial implications to ensure timely delivery.\n*   **Integrity of New Voting Methods:** The policy emphasizes maintaining the integrity of the postal voting process through strict validation criteria for PVAs (p.6), secure handling and storage of forms and data (p.7), and adherence to the \"Ballot Paper Handling Policy\" for Postal Vote Certificates (p.8, p.10).

Postal voters \n\n1.1  There are two categories of postal voters:  \n\n\u2022 \n\n\u2022 \n\nThose people that apply for a postal vote for a particular federal event. These people have to \napply to be sent voting papers for the applicable event. \n\nThose people that are registered as a General Postal Voter and have a registration code against \ntheir enrolment record. These people are automatically sent voting papers at the time of any \nelection.  \n\n2.  Postal voting for a particular event \n\n2.1  A person may apply for a postal vote on specified grounds. Those grounds are set out in Schedule 2 \n\nto the Electoral Act. In general terms, an elector may apply for a postal vote if, on polling day, they: \n\n\u2022 \n\n\u2022 \n\n\u2022 \n\n\u2022 \n\n\u2022 \n\n\u2022 \n\n\u2022 \n\n\u2022 \n\n\u2022 \n\n\u2022 \n\nare outside the electorate where they are enrolled to vote \n\nare more than 8km from a polling place \n\nare travelling \n\nare unable to leave their workplace to vote \n\nare seriously ill, infirm or due to give birth shortly (or caring for someone who is) \n\nare a patient in hospital and can't vote at the hospital \n\nhave religious beliefs that prevent them from attending a polling place \n\nare in prison serving a sentence of less than three years or otherwise detained \n\nare a silent elector \n\nhave a reasonable fear for their safety. \n\n2.2  A postal vote application (PVA) must be in writing on the form approved by the Electoral \n\nCommissioner (EC) which includes a declaration by the applicant that they are entitled to apply for a \npostal vote. A PVA may also be lodged online. \n\n2.3  An application may not be made until after the public announcement of the proposed date for polling \n\nor after the issue of a writ for an election or referendum (whichever is the earlier) (s 184 and Schedule \n2 of the Electoral Act). An announcement concerning an intended date for polling does not necessarily \nmeet the requirements of s 184 of the Electoral Act. The AEC may issue advice clarifying whether \nPVAs may be accepted in such instances. \n\nNote: The following clause will be affected by the decision that has been made not to visit said facilities for \nthe next election due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Further details on what arrangements will be made for \nthese electors will be released once confirmed. \n\n2.4  As soon as the public announcement of the election date is made, every effort must be made to \n\nensure that PVAs are also made available at places where mobile polling facilities may not be \nprovided during the election period, for example:  \n\n3       POLICY POSTAL VOTING\n\n\n--- Page 4 ---\n\n\u2022 \n\n\u2022 \n\n\u2022 \n\nnursing homes \n\nhospitals \n\nhigh-care facilities (including those in retirement villages and residential mental health facilities) \n\n\u2022  mining camps \n\n\u2022 \n\nprisons \n\nNote: It is important to ensure that all places holding stocks of PVAs are made aware of the need to \ndestroy superseded forms where the EC revokes an approved PVA and approves a replacement PVA. \n\n2.5  PVAs must be received by 6 pm on the Wednesday prior to polling day to be accepted. \n\n2.6  Section 184AA of the Electoral Act allows political parties and candidates to distribute PVAs with party \n\nmaterial attached.  \n\n3.  General postal voters (GPVs) \n\n3.1  An elector may apply for registration as a General Postal Voter (GPV), which entitles the elector to \n\nhave postal ballot papers for future federal elections automatically sent to them. \n\n3.2  An application for registration as a GPV must be made on one of the grounds specified in the Electoral \n\nAct (s 184A). In general terms, an elector can register to become a general postal voter if they are: \n\n\u2022 \n\n\u2022 \n\n\u2022 \n\n\u2022 \n\n\u2022 \n\n\u2022 \n\n\u2022 \n\n\u2022 \n\n\u2022 \n\n\u2022 \n\n\u2022 \n\nenrolled at an address more than 20 km away from a polling place \n\na patient at a hospital or nursing home and unable to travel to a polling place \n\nunable to travel due to being infirm at home \n\ncaring for a seriously ill or infirm person \n\nserving a prison sentence of less than 3 years \n\nregistered as a silent elector \n\nunable to attend a polling place due to religious beliefs \n\nunable to sign their name due to a physical incapacity \n\nregistered as an overseas elector \n\na member of the defence force, or a defence civilian serving outside Australia \n\nan Australian Federal Police officer or staff member serving outside Australia. \n\n3.3  There is no requirement that the application be made on an approved form, however the AEC strongly \nprefers to receive applications on forms approved for this purpose. To register as a GPV, electors can \ncomplete the GPV application form, which is available from any AEC office or on the AEC website.  \n\n3.4  An application to be registered as a GPV can be made at any time (s 185 of the Electoral Act). \n\nAccordingly, the process to register a GPV can also be done at any time. As soon as the ballot papers \nfor an election are available, postal voting papers must be sent to GPVs (s 186 of the Electoral Act). \n\n3.5  The EC must keep a register of GPVs for each division. Each register is to be made available for \ninspection by members of the public at the office of the DRO for the division during ordinary office \nhours (s 184B the Electoral Act). The GPV register must be printed from RMANS and further \ninformation can be found in Roll-How. \n\n3.6  The registration of an elector as a GPV may be cancelled by the EC if the ground on which the elector \n\napplied for registration no longer exists (s 185C of the Electoral Act). Although a registration can be \ncancelled at any such time, it is important to recognise that where that cancellation occurs after the \nclose of the roll for an election, the elector remains entitled to a postal vote for that election. For \ninformation on the cancellation of GPV registrations, see Roll-Why. \n\n4       POLICY POSTAL VOTING\n\n\n--- Page 5 ---\n\n3.7  Unlike PVAs for a particular event, the GPV registration process does not involve supplying or \n\nauthentication of a security question/answer before registration may occur.  \n\n3.8  Any GPV applications received between the close of rolls and the deadline for receiving PVAs can be \n\naccepted as a PVA and as a GPV registration. Because of this, the GPV forms cannot be scanned \nand processed as PVAs by the scanning service provider and instead should be copied and \nprocessed as PVAs manually into the AEC\u2019s automated postal vote issuing system (APVIS) by \ndivisions. The elector should also be registered as a GPV for subsequent events \u2013 due to ongoing \nstate and local elections the registration should be completed as soon as possible. \n\n4.  Use of PVAs by candidates and political \n\nparties \n\nSupply of paper PVAs \n\n4.1  Where the EC revokes a PVA form and approves a replacement, the Assistant Commissioner, \n\nDelivery and Support Branch is to contact all registered political parties, to advise them of the new \napproved form and the need to destroy superseded forms that may be being held as stock. \n\n4.2  All members, Senators and candidates will be encouraged to promote the Online Postal Vote \n\nApplication (OPVA) with their constituents. This service ensures that the AEC receives the \napplications in a timely manner and can send the postal vote pack out as soon as possible. \n\n4.3 \n\nIf requests for paper PVA forms (and reply envelopes) are received by states and divisions, these \nmust be redirected to the Elector and Roll Services team. This team will then investigate the reasons \nfor the request and if the OPVA is not suitable, will direct them to the pdf version on the AEC website. \nThis includes requests from  \n\n\u2022  Members and Senators \n\n\u2022 \n\n\u2022 \n\n\u2022 \n\n\u2022 \n\npolitical parties \n\ncandidates \n\nstate/territory members of parliament \n\npolitical interest groups (unions, lobby groups, peak industry bodies). \n\nReproduction of PVAs \n\n4.4  Subsection 184AA(1) of the Electoral Act allows a postal vote application form to be \u201cphysically \n\nattached to, or form part of, other written materials issued by any person or organisation.\u201d This allows \nfor political parties to provide PVAs to constituents alongside election materials.  \n\n4.5  The majority of paper PVA forms received by the AEC for processing during an event are those which \nhave been reproduced by a political party or candidates. It is important that the AEC communicates to \npolitical parties and candidates the importance of reproduced PVAs aligning with legislative \nrequirements to ensure electors are not disenfranchised and the scanning of said forms is as efficient \nas possible.  \n\n4.6 \n\nIt is the State Manager\u2019s role to communicate PVA requirements with political parties in the lead-up to \nelectoral events however Elector and Roll Services will provide information and guidance regarding \nthe key points related to postal voting. The information obtained from political parties these meetings \n(e.g. what their plans are regarding postal voting) should be treated confidentially; at a minimum it \nshould be known by the relevant State Manager, Director Operations, Director of Elector and Roll \nServices Section in NO, and the relevant DRO. \n\n4.7  The AEC provides print-ready artwork of the approved form and guidelines for its reproduction to any \n\nperson or organisation that wishes to reproduce PVAs. Requests to obtain a copy of the approved \n\n5       POLICY POSTAL VOTING\n\n\n--- Page 6 ---\n\nform and guidelines are to be made to the Director, Elector and Roll Services Section in National \nOffice (NO) through the AEC Service Desk. The office lodging this request via the AEC Service Desk \nmust also ensure that the relevant AEO is to be advised of this request. \n\n4.8  When dealing with candidates and political parties it is useful to ascertain relevant information \n\nconcerning their postal vote mail campaigns and provide information to them regarding AEC \nprocesses. Relevant information includes approximate volumes, areas of letterbox drops, and dates \nand intended method of delivery, noting that, if a Service Provider is being used, completed paper \nPVAs must be sent directly to that provider. This exchange of information will assist offices to manage \nthe workload, especially planned peaks in activity, but as this information is confidential (see 4.6) \nsteps must be taken to ensure only the information shared within the AEC network as needed.  \n\n5.  Receipt of PVAs \n\n5.1  Divisional offices (DOs) are not required to stay open to the public until 6pm on the Wednesday three \ndays before polling day to enable receipt of PVAs. However if members of the public come to a \ndivisional office when it is closed to the public, but staff are inside working, staff should attend to the \nperson and assist wherever possible. This may include accepting a paper form for processing. \n\n5.2  The PVA scanning provider must stay open until 6pm (local time) on the Wednesday three days \n\nbefore polling day to enable receipt of PVAs (s 184(5) of the Electoral Act). The scanning provider \nmust clear PO boxes, scan, vet and provide the data from the PVAs that evening to ensure the Postal \nVote Packs (PVP) can be produced and lodged as soon as possible.  \n\n5.3  Divisions must also factor in time to process after this deadline into their staffing plans, noting that \nOPVA and scanned PVA data may not appear in the manual intervention or local print queues until \n6.30pm (local time) due to the background system work. \n\n5.4  PVAs may be made to the EC or, in the case of an application made outside of Australia, also to an \n\nAssistant Returning Officer (ARO) (s 184 of the Electoral Act). \n\n5.5  While every effort should be made to ensure that superseded forms are destroyed, a PVA that is \nmade on a superseded form should be accepted if the application substantially complies with the \napproved form, that is, if the application contains all the information that is required by the Electoral \nAct and is received before 6pm on the Wednesday three days before polling day. \n\n\u2022 \n\nFor example, a form stating it must be received by 6pm Thursday two days before polling day \n(forms used at 2013 election stated this) may be accepted, but only if it satisfies the essential \ncriteria set out below. \n\n5.6  The following criteria are essential for a PVA to be considered valid: \n\n\u2022 \n\nthe application must include a declaration of entitlement to apply for a postal vote (s 184(1) of the \nElectoral Act) \n\n\u2212 \n\n\u2212 \n\npaper applications \u2013 the declaration of entitlement is the signature \n\nonline applications \u2013 the declaration of entitlement is the submission of the form \n\n\u2022 \n\n\u2022 \n\n\u2022 \n\nthe application must be dated (note \u2013 the date is automatically generated if a PVA is submitted \nonline) \n\nthe date must not be before the announcement of or issue of writ for an election or referendum \n(an incorrect date in the future however is acceptable provided the PVA is received on time) \n\nthe application must be received by 6pm on the Wednesday three days before polling day \n(s 184(5) of the Electoral Act) (refer to clause 6.10 in this policy). \n\nPVAs not meeting these criteria must be rejected and a defective PVA letter sent to the \napplicant. \n\n5.7  The following criteria are not essential for a PVA to be considered valid: \n\n6       POLICY POSTAL VOTING\n\n\n--- Page 7 ---\n\n\u2022 \n\n\u2022 \n\n\u2022 \n\n\u2022 \n\n\u2022 \n\n\u2022 \n\napplicant\u2019s full name details (e.g. an initial is given instead of a given name) \n\napplicant\u2019s enrolled address details \n\napplicant\u2019s date of birth \n\npostal address \n\ncontact phone number or email address \n\nsecurity question and answer \n\nIf a PVA is missing any or all of these details it must still be accepted. \n\n5.8  The assessment of substantial compliance on non-PVA forms (i.e. letters, form reproductions etc.) \nmust be sent to the Elector and Roll Services team. A decision on these will be done on a case by \ncase basis by the Assistant Commissioner, Elector and Roll Services Section (or delegate) and advice \nprovided to staff directly or via the intranet (if a trend emerges). \n\n5.9 \n\nIf a PVA meets the essential requirements set out above, the postal voting material must be sent to \nthe applicant (s.188(1) of the Electoral Act). \n\n6.  Processing paper PVA forms  \n\n6.1 \n\nInformation from PVA forms will be captured electronically (via a Service Provider with OCR/ICR \ncapability) and/or manually via data entry by AEC staff in RMANS APVIS. \n\n6.2  Timeliness and quality are paramount in either of the above options. If a Service Provider is used: \n\n6.2.1  Arrangements will be made to ensure they receive the paper PVAs as soon as possible. This will \ninclude directions to candidates and parties to directly deliver bulk PVAs to the Service Provider, \nthe Service Provider managing the PO Boxes advertised on the form and AEC website for \nreturned completed forms and the electronic transfer of PVAs from AEC offices to the Service \nProvider. \n\n6.2.2  Strict business and quality rules will be established to ensure correct identification of paper \nPVAs and the correct and efficient capture of data on said forms. These vetting rules will be \npublished before each election and exceptions to these rules will be managed by Elector and \nRoll Services.  \n\n6.2.3  The Service Provider will regularly feed PVA data back to the AEC. This data will be processed \n\nin RMANS APVIS  \n\nNote: A paper PVA form may meet the vetting rules in 6.2.2 but will still need divisional intervention in \nRMANS APVIS if RMANS cannot make the necessary matches to determine entitlement. \n\n6.3  The Service Provider will hold PVA images in an accessible repository for scrutiny and archiving \n\nprocesses. Staff will have access to these images via RMANS APVIS and Declaration Vote Scrutiny \nsub-systems.  \n\n6.4 \n\nIf a Service Provider isn\u2019t being used, PVAs can be manually entered by divisional staff in AEC offices, \nOPCs or in state cells, depending on state management plans.  \n\n6.5  States must ensure that they have sufficient staff (with appropriate systems and RMANS APVIS \n\naccess) and resources to: \n\n6.5.1 \n\nreceive PVAs and transfer them to the Service Provider (as long as the PVA is received by the \nAEC by the deadline); and  \n\n6.5.2  process PVA records received back from the Service Provider in RMANS APVIS efficiently, \n\nincluding after the 6pm deadline. \n\n6.6  Forms processed in AEC offices must be stored securely as they contain personal information.  \n\n7       POLICY POSTAL VOTING\n\n\n--- Page 8 ---\n\nForwarding paper PVAs received in an AEC office to the Service \nProvider \n\n6.7 \n\nIf a Service Provider is being used, staff are reminded that the Service Provider\u2019s processes will result \nin a timelier capture of data, depending on when the forms are sent to them. Therefore, staff must \nsend all paper PVAs to the Service Provider either via electronic transfer or courier. For example:  \n\n\u2022 \n\nif a box of forms is dropped off (e.g. by a candidate or party official), then AEC staff must advise \nthat they should be delivered to the Service Providers address. If they refuse to deliver them to \nthe correct address, or they have been left by a courier, then that box of PVAs should be \ncouriered directly to the Service Provider as is (i.e. the box shouldn\u2019t be opened and checked). If \n1-100 forms are received, states and divisions must electronically send them to the Service \nProvider as they are received. \n\no  Forms electronically sent to the Service Provider must be stored securely, but separately to \n\nthose in 6.6 \n\n\u2022  However, if that box is received between 12-6pm on the Wednesday before polling day, the box \n\nshould be opened and the PVAs transferred electronically to the Service Provider. Whilst strict \nvetting is not required in this scenario, the removal of obviously incomplete or non-PVA material \nshould be done. \n\n6.8  GPV forms must be retained in the office and processed directly into RMANS APVIS. \n\nFailure to meet deadline for PVA \n\n6.9 \n\n If a PVA is received after 6pm on the Wednesday three days before polling day, it fails to meet the \ndeadline and the applicant should be advised of that fact and that they will have to vote by other \nmeans (s 184(5), 184(6) of the Electoral Act).  \n\n6.10 \n\nIf the PVA is received by the Service Provider, the AEC may decide to use their services to send a \n\u201cPVA received too late\u201d message (via email or SMS) to the applicant. The Service Provider will also \nscan and transfer the data contained on the PVA to the AEC.  \n\n6.11 \n\nIf the paper PVA is received by an AEC office then AEC staff should attempt to contact the elector and \nprocess the PVA in RMANS APVIS as too late. \n\n6.12 \n\nIf a large number of forms are received by AEC offices after the deadline but before polling day (i.e. \nfrom a candidate or party) these should be sent to the Service Provider (if being used) as they will be \nable to scan and notify applicants more efficiently than divisional staff. \n\n7. \n\nIssuing postal votes \n\n7.1 \n\nIf the EC or an ARO receives a PVA that meets one of the specified grounds, the EC or ARO must \nsend a Postal Voting Certificate (PVC) and the postal voting papers to the applicant.  \n\n7.2  Postal voting material (including the PVC) may be generated and issued centrally (via a Service \n\nProvider), locally or by a \u2018hybrid\u2019 method, where for certain postcodes the system will use local printing \nfrom a particular location regardless of where the PVA was processed. RMANS APVIS will be used to \ndetermine the method that ensures the best possible delivery timeframe.  \n\n7.3  PVCs with House of Representatives ballot paper stock attached to them are considered ballot \n\npapers. The handling, storing and transporting of PVCs must comply with requirements of the Ballot \nPaper Handling Policy, prior to, during dispatching and upon return to the division. Preparation and \nissuing of PVCs must be done in a ballot paper secure working zone whether being dispatched by a \nService Provider or AEC office. \n\n7.4 \n\nIt is expected that RMANS APVIS would be used to issue all PVCs, however in circumstances where \nthe system is not available (e.g. due to a network or power failure) it may be necessary to issue PVCs \nmanually (see Producing Postal Vote Certificates SOP).  \n\n8       POLICY POSTAL VOTING\n\n\n--- Page 9 ---\n\n8.  Delivery of postal votes \n\n8.1  The AEC endeavours to deliver postal votes in sufficient time for the elector to vote before 6pm on \npolling day. Postal vote material must be sent by post or other means, not being electronic means \nsuch as fax or email.  \n\n8.2  Postal votes are normally delivered to the applicant by Australia Post priority service, however for all \n\nPVAs received before 6pm on the Wednesday three days before polling day, the postal voting material \nmust be sent to the applicant by a means considered to be the most reasonable and practicable in the \ncircumstances (s 188(2) of the Electoral Act). \n\n8.3  Therefore all divisions must develop a postal vote delivery plan that does not depend on Australia Post \nfactors in the time taken to print locally and collate the PVC packs. This will require divisions to \ninvestigate the alternative non-Australia Post delivery options available in their divisions for sending \npostal voting material where the postcode is hybrid in RMANS APVIS or local knowledge indicates \nthat delivery by means other than Australia Post needs to be considered. \n\n8.4  Where the use of standard, priority or express postal services or standard courier services is likely to \nlead to disenfranchisement, other services can be used as long as delivery of the voting material can \nbe achieved within the necessary timeframes and does not exceed a cost of $100 per elector \nserviced. \n\n\u2022 \n\nFor example: delivering postal votes to a remote township of 20 electors at a cost of $1,500 \nwould be acceptable since the cost is $75 per elector.  \n\n8.5  Reasonable and practicable means of delivery includes: \n\n\u2022 \n\n\u2022 \n\ncommercially available couriers \n\nvehicle or taxi use by an AEC staff member. \n\n8.6  Reasonable and practicable means does not extend to providing a PVC to a third party authorised by \n\nthe applicant. \n\n8.7  The EC (or delegate) may decide that Australia Post is still a reasonable and practicable means of \ndelivery. This would apply in circumstances where a postcode receives regular mail services.  \n\n8.8  A means of sending postal voting material will not be a reasonable and practicable means of delivery if \nit cannot be expected that the applicant would receive that material in sufficient time to vote before \nclose of polling (s 194 of the Electoral Act). \n\n8.9  DROs must receive approval (including Rule 18 financial approval) from state office if they use a \n\nmeans of delivery other than those described above. Any service which exceeds the cost per elector \nthreshold is to be treated as a policy exception. \n\n9.  Silent electors \n\n9.1  Most silent electors are registered as GPVs, and receive postal voting material automatically through \n\ncentral production, however some may choose to apply for postal votes.  \n\n9.2  Silent electors are able to apply using the online PVA system, however it is recommended they use \n\nalternative forms of voting to ensure maximum confidentiality of their information. \n\n9.3 \n\nIf a silent elector chooses to lodge a PVA online or their paper PVA is sent to the scanning centre, \ntheir classified information will be suppressed in RMANS APVIS once they are matched as a silent \nelector. \n\n9.4 \n\nIf a silent elector\u2019s Postal Vote Pack (PVP) can be printed and lodged via central print, then the \nrelevant data will be sent as part of the daily postal voting data file to the Service Provider. \n\n9       POLICY POSTAL VOTING\n\n\n--- Page 10 ---\n\n9.5 \n\n9.6 \n\nIf a local or hybrid print PVP is required, then only an AEC employee that has permission from the \nAEC to deal with silent electors can manually prepare postal voting materials for silent electors.  \n\nIf the elector has included their enrolled address on a PVA (that is stored in a divisional office) it must \nbe masked or obliterated by using a black marker pen. \n\n10.  Replacement of spoilt, missing, lost or \n\ndestroyed postal ballot papers  \n\n10.1  A postal voter who spoils a postal ballot paper may obtain another postal ballot paper by returning the \nspoilt ballot paper to any AEC office. A replacement postal ballot paper may then be posted or issued \npersonally to the voter at any time up to the close of the poll. However, the postal voting material must \nnot be sent by post (or any other means) if it cannot be expected that the applicant would receive that \nmaterial in sufficient time to vote before close of polling (s 194 of the Electoral Act). \n\n10.1.1  If a person cannot physically attend the office to return their spoilt ballot paper, and they claim \n\nthat they cannot make their intended preference clear, advice should be sought from Elector and \nRoll Services on how to proceed (via the AEC Service Desk) \n\n10.2 \n\nIf an elector claims that their ballot paper (or PVC) has been lost, destroyed beyond salvage, or was \nnever received, a new PVC may be issued by reprocessing the PVA, provided the elector has \nprovided written confirmation attesting to this. \n\n11.  Postal ballot papers returned undelivered \n\n11.1  Any postal voting material returned undelivered prior to polling day should be dealt with immediately. \nEvery effort should be made to re-direct the postal voting materials and document steps taken, if any \nare possible, to achieve this (see Postal Voting SOP). \n\n12.  Receipting postal vote certificates \n\n12.1  PVCs are to be receipted on their arrival at AEC premises. This may be conducted at the divisional \noffice, state processing cell, or once transferred to the divisional out-posted centre. The process for \nreceipting PVCs is covered in the Receiving Postal Votes SOP. Note that PVCs are ballot papers and \nare to be handled in accordance with the Ballot Paper Handling Policy. \n\n12.2  PVCs must be receipted up to and after the 13 day post polling receipt period. This information flows \ninto ELMS allowing for accurate estimates for declaration exchange, postal scrutinies and the virtual \ntally room advising parties, candidates and the general public as to how many votes are left to count \nand how many were too late. The Elector and Roll Services team will advise when the RMANS Dec \nVote Scrutiny system is locked and when receipting PVCs can cease. All PVCs received after the \ncutoff must remain securely stored until otherwise advised. \n\n10       POLICY POSTAL VOTING\n\n\n--- Page 11 ---\n\nGlossary for postal voting \n\nAutomated Postal Vote Issuing System (RMANS APVIS): is an election sub-system of the Roll \nManagement System (RMANS EP) used for the registration of PVA details to issue PVCs or defective \nletters. APVIS also captures the date of lodgement with Australia Post and when the PVC is returned to the \nAEC. \n\nBallot paper secure work zone: designated and segregated area, clearly marked via use of bollards, \ndividers or tape, for the interim placement of ballot papers while they are in use and it is not practicable to \nundertake the work in a storage zone (see Ballot Paper Handling Policy). \n\nComputershare (CCS): AEC\u2019s PVA scanning and PVP mail house services contractor who will receive, \nscan and vet all postal vote applications and prepare and lodge PVPs. \n\nGeneral Postal Voter (GPV): an elector who is registered to have postal ballot papers sent to them \nautomatically. Electors from certain categories who have difficulty getting to a polling place on polling day \ncan register as a GPV. \n\nOptical Character Recognition / Intelligent Character Recognition (OCR/ICR): OCR/ICR technologies \ntranslate scanned images into data that can be used in database systems and verified against other data. \n\nOnline Postal Vote Application (OPVA): an electronic form that allows an applicant to securely submit a \nPVA to the AEC using any web-enabled device in Australia or overseas. \n\nPostal voter: a voter who satisfies one of the grounds of application for postal vote set out in Schedule 2 of \nthe Electoral Act and who may apply in writing for a postal vote using a PVA form. Upon receipt of a PVA, \npostal voting material will be dispatched for completion and return prior to the close of poll. \n\nPostal Vote Application (PVA): an application for a postal vote which must be in writing on the form \napproved by the Electoral Commissioner which includes a declaration by the applicant that they are entitled \nto apply for a postal vote. A PVA may also be lodged online.  \n\nPostal Vote Certificate (PVC): the declaration specific to postal voting on which the elector declares their \nentitlement to vote. PVCs may be produced using PVA information entered into APVIS by either: \n\n\u2022  Central production: a PVP is produced centrally to ensure timely delivery to the postal voter. \n\n\u2022  Hybrid print production: where the postcode has only one or two mail deliveries per week and \nAPVIS determines if the PVC is best printed by the owning divisions or another nominated \ndivision. \n\n\u2022 \n\nLocal print production: printing PVCs in divisional/state offices when central production could \nnot ensure timely delivery of the PVP. \n\nPostal Vote Pack (PVP) or postal voting materials: the certificate and ballot papers issued to an applicant \nfor a postal vote. A postal vote pack consists of the following and are inserted into an outer envelope \naddressed to the elector. \n\n\u2022 \n\n\u2022 \n\n\u2022 \n\n\u2022 \n\nthe printed PVC with attached House of Representatives ballot paper \n\nSenate ballot paper \n\nreferendum ballot papers (if applicable) \n\na domestic or overseas postal voting leaflet (Getting help to complete your postal vote leaflet \n(EF045) if within Australia, or How to complete your overseas postal vote (EF610) if overseas)  \n\n\u2022  Domestic or overseas return envelope. \n\n11       POLICY POSTAL VOTING\n\n\n--- Page 12 ---\n\nRelevant policies and references \n\nBallot Paper Handling Policy \n\nRMANS Election Processing User Manual, Subpart 3 RMANS Automated Postal Voting Issuing System \n\nELMS Quick Reference Guide \u2013 Ballot Paper Printing \n\nPreliminary Scrutiny SOP \n\nPostal Vote Application Processing SOP \n\nProducing Postal Vote Certificates SOP \n\nReceiving Postal Votes SOP \n\nRoll-Why \n\n12       POLICY POSTAL VOTING"}, {"type": "pdf", "output_file_path": "/downloaded_originals/Document No. 6.pdf", "content_files": [], "extracted_text_path": "/extracted_texts/LEX2846_Document No. 6.txt", "ai_summaries": {"balanced": {"text": "The document is an internal Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) file register, providing an index of documents related to its COVID-19 pandemic response.\n\n**Relevance to FOI Request LEX2846:**\n\nThis document directly supports the FOI request overview by demonstrating the breadth and depth of the AEC's preparations and adaptations for conducting federal elections during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n*   **Legislative Changes and Enfranchisement:** The entry \"2022 Legislative Change - COVID enfranchisement\" confirms the AEC's engagement with legislative adjustments, aligning with the \"Commonwealth Electoral (COVID Enfranchisement) Regulations 2022\" mentioned in the FOI request.\n*   **Operational Planning and Challenges:** Numerous entries related to \"COVID-19 Planning,\" \"COVID Crisis Scenario Testing,\" \"COVID-19 - staffing,\" and \"Procuring a consultant\" for a \"Covid19 Response Unit\" underscore the significant logistical, financial, and staffing challenges faced by the AEC.\n*   **COVID-Safe Measures:** The register details extensive efforts to implement COVID-safe measures, evidenced by entries such as \"COVID-19 WHS products,\" \"State COVID Safe Plans,\" \"PRJ - COVIDSafe Plan,\" and \"SCM Policy COVID PPE responses.\" These indicate the AEC's focus on ensuring health and safety at polling places.\n*   **Policy and Communication:** Documents like \"COVID-19 Policy - ELECTIONS, BALLOTS AND REFERENDUMS,\" \"COVID-19 Communications,\" and \"COVID-19 eLearning\" highlight the AEC's development of new policies, public communication strategies, and staff training to adapt to the pandemic and maintain the integrity of new voting methods.\n*   **Comprehensive Management:** The presence of timeline documents (\"COVID-19 Timeline 2020,\" \"COVID-19 Timeline of Events\") and various reports (\"COVID-19 Analysis,\" \"COVID-19 Surveys\") indicates a comprehensive, data-driven approach to managing the pandemic's impact on electoral processes.\n\nIn essence, this document serves as a foundational index, validating the specific areas of AEC activity and documentation outlined in the FOI request overview.", "model": "gemini-2.5-flash", "generated_at": "2025-06-24T00:06:57.699846", "source_hash": "2bb95679e98655453e63f3cc42802dd00951ed7a25668cc9cf9b041d91693eec", "raw_response_path": "data/llm_responses/LEX2846__per_file__balanced__Document No. 6.pdf__20250624T000657.json", "output_tokens": 453, "prompt_tokens": 3783, "total_tokens": 5999, "summary_length": 2094}, "left_leaning": {"needs_summary": true, "source_hash": "2bb95679e98655453e63f3cc42802dd00951ed7a25668cc9cf9b041d91693eec"}, "right_leaning": {"needs_summary": true, "source_hash": "2bb95679e98655453e63f3cc42802dd00951ed7a25668cc9cf9b041d91693eec"}, "government_skeptic": {"needs_summary": true, "source_hash": "2bb95679e98655453e63f3cc42802dd00951ed7a25668cc9cf9b041d91693eec"}, "government_apologist": {"needs_summary": true, "source_hash": "2bb95679e98655453e63f3cc42802dd00951ed7a25668cc9cf9b041d91693eec"}, "highly_critical": {"needs_summary": true, "source_hash": "2bb95679e98655453e63f3cc42802dd00951ed7a25668cc9cf9b041d91693eec"}}, "filename": "Document No. 6.pdf", "download_path": "/foi_assets/LEX2846/Document No. 6.pdf", "extracted_text": "\n\n--- Page 1 ---\n\nName\n\nId\n\nFile Number\n\nOwner\n\nCreated On\n\nFOI request- COVID\n\n0.

Specifically, it requested:\n*   Drafts of legislation, explanatory material, policy papers, and briefs related to the development of the COVID Enfranchisement Bill and Regulations.\n*   Advice provided to AEC social media and call-centre staff on assisting COVID-positive voters.\n*   Policy documents concerning the use of postal voting for COVID-positive voters.\n*   A list of files from the AEC's record management systems containing \"COVID\", \"COVID-19\", \"coronavirus\", or \"pandemic\".\n\nThe released documents include:\n*   An Australian Electoral Commission submission to the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters (JSCEM) from November 2020.\n*   Draft Commonwealth Electoral (COVID Enfranchisement) Regulations 2022.\n*   A \"Customer Journey\" draft (version 7) outlining a proposed voting experience for COVID-isolating customers, dated March 2022.\n*   Various internal documents providing talking points, key messages, and contact centre scripts for AEC staff regarding secure telephone voting for COVID-19 affected voters, dated between March and May 2022.\n*   The AEC's Postal Voting policy, dated February 2022.\n*   A list of relevant files from the AEC's record management system.\n\n### Main Content from FOI Request Documents:\n\n**1. COVID Enfranchisement Legislation & Telephone Voting:**\n*   The **Commonwealth Electoral (COVID Enfranchisement) Regulations 2022** were drafted to establish a secure telephone voting method for \"coronavirus affected individuals.\" This measure was proposed for federal elections, allowing voters who test positive for COVID-19 and are directed to self-isolate/quarantine to cast their vote by phone if they cannot attend a polling place.\n*   **Eligibility** requires an individual to be registered, on an approved electoral roll, not have already voted, and to have become COVID-affected within a specific narrow timeframe (e.g., from 6:01 pm four days before polling day) under a public health order preventing their attendance at a polling place.\n*   The **Customer Journey draft** details a two-step process: **Registration**, where voters register online or by phone providing personal details and evidence of their positive test (e.g., reference/serial number from a health authority) to receive a unique registration number and PIN; and **Voting**, where they call a dedicated line, quote their registration number and PIN (for anonymity), and verbally instruct an operator on how to mark their ballot.\n*   The **Staff Talking Points** and **Contact Centre Scripts** emphasize that this is an \"emergency measure only\" and anticipate \"long wait times.\" They provide guidance on proof of COVID-19 status, registration and voting hours, and strongly encourage voters to view ballot paper images online beforehand to expedite calls.\n\n**2. Postal Voting for COVID-Positive Voters:**\n*   The **Postal Voting policy (February 2022)** outlines the general framework for postal votes, which can be utilized by individuals unable to attend a polling place due to serious illness or infirmity, a category that can include COVID-positive voters.\n*   A note within the policy confirms that \"mobile polling facilities may not be provided\" to nursing homes and hospitals due to the COVID-19 pandemic, suggesting increased reliance on postal voting for these vulnerable groups.\n*   **Staff Talking Points** advised COVID-positive individuals who tested positive earlier than the telephone voting eligibility cut-off to apply for a postal vote, also addressing concerns like securing a witness while isolating.\n\n**3. General Election Administration & COVID Impact:**\n*   The **JSCEM Submission (November 2020)** highlights the AEC's need for greater legislative flexibility (amendments to the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918) to manage elections during emergencies. This includes granting the Electoral Commissioner powers to determine electoral processes and to adjourn or suspend polling.\n*   The submission outlines significant **logistical and financial impacts** of conducting elections during the pandemic, drawing lessons from the Eden-Monaro by-election (2020).

The core \"COVID Enfranchisement Regulations\" and associated policies were emergency measures designed to allow COVID-positive individuals to vote, primarily through a secure telephone voting service. This expanded access, alongside provisions for postal voting and mobile polling (initially suspended then adapted for aged care), aimed to prevent widespread disenfranchisement due to public health orders. Positive steps include the provision of assistance for voters with disabilities (e.g., blind/low vision telephone voting), the inclusion of telephone interpreter services, and communication materials available in 33 languages, demonstrating an intent to reach diverse communities. The commitment to allowing voters still in the phone queue at closing time to cast their vote also aligns with preventing arbitrary exclusion.\n\nHowever, several deviations from progressive ideals of equitable access are evident. The telephone voting service, while crucial, was narrow in scope, limited to those *diagnosed* with COVID-19 after a specific cutoff, excluding close contacts or those with symptoms who might still be hesitant to vote in person. The reliance on voters to register online for phone voting and to view ballot paper images digitally introduces a digital literacy and access barrier. The requirement for voters to provide \"evidence\" of their COVID-positive status, including retaining reference/serial numbers for tests for 40 days, places an administrative burden on individuals who are ill or otherwise vulnerable. The continued emphasis on compulsory voting, even for ill individuals, shifts the onus onto sick citizens to justify non-voting, rather than ensuring frictionless access. Furthermore, the explicit rejection of broader online voting for federal elections, regardless of personal circumstances, represents a missed opportunity for modernizing and permanently enhancing accessibility, contrasting with calls for more flexible and secure digital democratic participation. Significant barriers also remained for overseas electors, with low postal vote admission rates highlighted in the Eden-Monaro by-election.\n\n**Environmental Impact:**\nThe documents implicitly reveal a deviation from environmental sustainability. The implementation of COVID-safe election practices necessitated a substantial increase in single-use items, including \"130,000 single-use half-size pencils,\" \"disinfectant wipes,\" and \"disposable gloves\" for the Eden-Monaro by-election alone. Extrapolated to a federal election, this would lead to millions of additional waste items, conflicting with progressive environmental goals of waste reduction and sustainable resource use.\n\n**Wealth Distribution and Corporate Influence:**\nThe documents show a significant financial impact of conducting elections during a pandemic. The Eden-Monaro by-election costs almost doubled to $3.954 million, with an estimated \"30 per cent increase in polling staff required, costing approximately an additional $13 million\" and over \"$30 million\" for PPE and other prevention materials for a full federal election. This reallocation of public funds, while necessary for health safety, points to the economic strain of maintaining democratic processes under crisis conditions.\n\nA key concern from a progressive standpoint is the reliance on private contractors for critical electoral infrastructure. \"Computershare (CCS)\" is explicitly named as the AEC's \"PVA scanning and PVP mail house services contractor,\" handling postal vote applications and dispatch. While the AEC mentions \"strict business and quality rules,\" the outsourcing of such fundamental components of election administration to a private corporation raises questions about potential corporate influence, transparency, and accountability, as well as the potential for profiteering from a public service. The document also notes that the cost of \"normal election materials is impacted by the pandemic, where either the materials themselves, or components to make them are often sourced overseas,\" highlighting global supply chain vulnerabilities and a lack of domestic production for essential electoral supplies, further intertwining corporate interests with the democratic process.\n\n**Overall Alignment/Deviation:**\nThe AEC's actions, as revealed in these documents, largely represent a reactive and temporary response to a crisis, prioritizing the immediate maintenance of the electoral process under duress. While efforts to ensure enfranchisement for COVID-affected individuals align with core social justice values, the solutions often create new administrative burdens or highlight existing systemic rigidities (e.g., legislative constraints preventing more agile or comprehensive digital voting options). The significant cost increases and reliance on private contractors for core services, coupled with the environmental impact of single-use items, deviate from progressive aspirations for efficient, publicly-controlled, and environmentally sustainable democratic systems. The temporary nature of the \"COVID Enfranchisement Regulations\" (repealed end of 2022) suggests a reluctance to embed these emergency innovations as permanent, more broadly accessible civil liberties.", "model": "gemini-2.5-flash", "generated_at": "2025-06-22T14:17:24.178752", "source_hash": "5d58cc1fccab83e034cf056b4ff1e224d1da9fb2e8c5c5ebf6b69b8d647a198c", "raw_response_path": "data/llm_responses/LEX2846__overall__left_leaning__20250622T141724.json", "output_tokens": 998, "prompt_tokens": 51014, "total_tokens": 55907, "summary_length": 5727}, "short_index": {"text": "The Australian Electoral Commission's COVID-era operations presented a mixed alignment with progressive values, commendably implementing emergency measures like secure telephone voting and multi-language resources to uphold enfranchisement for COVID-positive individuals.

Simultaneously, the necessitated surge in single-use items significantly increased environmental waste, while soaring costs and the outsourcing of critical electoral infrastructure to private contractors like Computershare raised concerns about corporate influence over a fundamental public service.

The Eden-Monaro by-election saw its cost almost double to $3.954 million, attributed to additional polling locations, increased staffing for sanitization and queue control, personal protective equipment (PPE), and new communication and training packages. Projections for a federal election indicated an estimated 30% increase in polling staff ($13 million additional cost) and over $30 million for specialized COVID-19 prevention materials. Operational efficiency also suffered, with vote issuing processes taking 46% longer. The establishment of a large-scale telephone voting service, while aiming for enfranchisement, inherently introduces logistical complexities and acknowledged \"long wait times,\" indicating an inefficient use of resources and voter time, even with a projected 7,000 operators. These measures represent a significant deviation from principles of economic efficiency, driven by an expansion of services under emergency conditions.\n\n**Individual Liberty:**\nThe documents show a complex relationship with individual liberty. On one hand, efforts were made to ensure all eligible citizens could exercise their right to vote, including those in isolation, by introducing secure telephone voting and expanding postal voting options. This *supports* the fundamental liberty of democratic participation. However, the implementation introduces new restrictions and burdens. Telephone voting eligibility was narrow, requiring individuals to have tested positive *after* a specific cutoff time and to provide health authority reference numbers for their positive tests. This collection of personal health data and the requirement for specific declarations, backed by penalties for false information, can be viewed as an increased encroachment on individual privacy and a bureaucratic burden. The continued enforcement of compulsory voting, even with the added complexities of pandemic-era voting methods and potential long wait times, subtly prioritizes state mandate over ease of individual choice, leading to a tension with the principle of individual liberty.\n\n**National Security:**\nThe documents implicitly touch on national security through the emphasis on maintaining the integrity and public confidence in federal elections, even during an emergency. The Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) explicitly states its commitment to \"safeguard democracy\" and deliver \"high integrity elections.\" The introduction of secure telephone voting, with measures like PINs, registration numbers, and scrutineer oversight (with an option for voters to opt-out of observation), aims to protect the secrecy and validity of the vote. However, the shift away from traditional in-person voting to a system relying on remote operators and digital registration, even with safeguards, could raise long-term concerns about system vulnerability and public trust in the electoral process, which are critical to national stability and security.\n\n**Fiscal Responsibility:**\nThe extensive costs detailed for adapting election processes to the pandemic explicitly demonstrate a significant deviation from fiscal responsibility. The doubling of by-election costs and multi-million dollar projections for a federal election underline a readiness to incur substantial taxpayer expense to maintain voting access during a crisis. The allowance for \"reasonable and practicable\" alternative postal vote delivery methods at a cost of up to $100 per elector, while ensuring enfranchisement, points to a willingness to expand spending without strict adherence to cost-effectiveness. This reflects a reactive rather than a fiscally conservative approach to unforeseen circumstances.\n\n**Limited Government:**\nThe documents reveal a marked expansion of government power and reach. The AEC's submission explicitly requests broader powers for the Electoral Commissioner, including the ability to determine how electoral processes are undertaken, and to adjourn or suspend polling and other election requirements. While framed as necessary \"flexibility\" for emergency situations, this grant of discretionary authority to an unelected official represents a notable deviation from the principle of limited government and separation of powers. The rapid establishment of a large-scale, government-run telephone voting operation (utilizing other Commonwealth department call centres and thousands of government employees) for a \"temporary\" emergency measure further illustrates an expansion of bureaucratic footprint and direct government intervention in civic processes. The Minister's power to specify additional matters for telephone voting eligibility also concentrates power, potentially allowing for political considerations to influence what should be an impartial administrative process.", "model": "gemini-2.5-flash", "generated_at": "2025-06-22T14:17:58.093287", "source_hash": "5d58cc1fccab83e034cf056b4ff1e224d1da9fb2e8c5c5ebf6b69b8d647a198c", "raw_response_path": "data/llm_responses/LEX2846__overall__right_leaning__20250622T141758.json", "output_tokens": 886, "prompt_tokens": 51014, "total_tokens": 55552, "summary_length": 5246}, "short_index": {"text": "The FOI documents reveal the government's COVID-19 response significantly compromised core conservative principles, demonstrating a profound deviation from **economic efficiency** with by-election costs nearly doubling and multi-million dollar projections for future elections due to expanded measures and inherent inefficiencies in new voting methods.

While framed as an emergency measure (and indeed set to be repealed at the end of 2022), its implementation demonstrates a severe lack of foresight and a concerning shift in control. The regulations grant the Electoral Commissioner broad powers to \"determine how certain electoral processes and activities may be undertaken\" and \"adjourn or suspend polling,\" effectively allowing for a top-down modification of established electoral law without direct parliamentary oversight for each decision.\n\nThe **telephone voting system**, in particular, stands out as a questionable expenditure and a potential compromise to voting integrity:\n*   **Massive Cost & Inefficiency:** Despite being billed as an \"emergency measure,\" the AEC projected an \"estimated 30 per cent increase in polling staff required, costing approximately an additional $13 million,\" purely for staffing due to COVID-19 measures. Furthermore, procuring specialized PPE alone was estimated to \"raise the cost of running a federal election by in excess of $30 million.\" The system required \"approximately 7000 operators\" for a service the AEC admitted would likely result in \"long wait times.\" This suggests a colossal outlay of taxpayer money for a service acknowledged to be cumbersome and potentially frustrating for voters.\n*   **Questionable Integrity & Lack of Transparency:** The \"Customer Journey\" document reveals a system where a call center operator \"records the voter\u2019s preference on the ballot papers.\" This removes the physical act of voting from the elector, introducing a third-party intermediary into the casting of a secret ballot. Critically, while \"scrutineers\" (party observers) could \"listen to a call between a voter and a call centre operator,\" the regulations explicitly state that \"An audio recording must not be made of a request to vote by a secure telephone vote or of a vote by a secure telephone vote.\" This deliberate omission of audio records, even when observers are present, is a glaring red flag for accountability and independent verification of vote accuracy. Additionally, the limitation that scrutineers cannot exceed the number of operators further restricts oversight.\n*   **Arbitrary and Shifting Eligibility:** The eligibility for telephone voting was tightly restricted \u2013 only for those testing positive *after* a specific date (initially 6pm Tuesday 17 May, then expanded to Friday 13 May) *and* unable to attend a polling place. The social media guidance highlights the reactive nature of these changes, stating \"If this changes today there will be public communications to advise the detail.\" This last-minute policy shift likely caused confusion and potentially disenfranchised voters who tested positive earlier or whose isolation dates didn't perfectly align. The AEC's own communications acknowledge, \"No online voting for federal elections is available, regardless of personal circumstances,\" making the operator-mediated phone system appear as an unnecessary, costly, and less secure substitute for a more direct digital solution if one were genuinely needed.\n\nThe **Eden-Monaro by-election** serves as a stark precursor to these nationwide issues. The AEC's submission indicates the by-election's cost \"almost doubling the total cost, to $3.954 million\" from an average of $2 million, primarily due to \"additional polling locations... additional staff required for sanitising, queue control and vote issuing and counting; PPE and other hygiene materials and services.\" Yet, turnout only saw a \"slight drop\" from 93.31% to 89.13%, raising the question of whether such a disproportionate financial outlay was genuinely necessary or efficient for maintaining participation. The AEC's internal data modeling for queue times also suggests that \"even in times of emergency and crisis,\" their preference is for \"evidence-based staffing estimations that prioritise safety and the efficient flow of voters,\" implying that the staffing increases were a planned response to a perceived (rather than empirically proven) need for additional staff to manage COVID-related process slowdowns.\n\nFinally, the **Postal Voting policy** reveals a subtle shift in responsibility and accessibility for vulnerable groups. It notes that \"mobile polling facilities may not be provided during the election period\" for locations like \"nursing homes, hospitals, high-care facilities, mining camps, prisons,\" directing these vulnerable populations to postal voting instead. This offloads the burden of access onto these individuals, potentially leading to further disenfranchisement, especially given the complexities and delays associated with postal votes during a pandemic.\n\nIn summary, the documents paint a picture of an AEC given expanded emergency powers, which it then used to implement a highly expensive, complex, and potentially opaque telephone voting system. This system, while intended to address pandemic-related voting challenges, appears to have prioritized a heavily staffed, operator-driven approach over more transparent or cost-effective digital alternatives, all while quietly shifting the burden of accessibility onto vulnerable voters and undermining public trust through a lack of critical audit trails.", "model": "gemini-2.5-flash", "generated_at": "2025-06-22T14:18:25.725278", "source_hash": "5d58cc1fccab83e034cf056b4ff1e224d1da9fb2e8c5c5ebf6b69b8d647a198c", "raw_response_path": "data/llm_responses/LEX2846__overall__government_skeptic__20250622T141825.json", "output_tokens": 1067, "prompt_tokens": 51010, "total_tokens": 53742, "summary_length": 5673}, "short_index": {"text": "The FOI documents expose an Australian Electoral Commission that leveraged the COVID-19 pandemic to embrace a reactive and extraordinarily costly approach to managing elections, raising profound concerns about fiscal prudence, transparency, and the integrity of the voting process.

These documents demonstrate a proactive, adaptive, and transparent approach to ensuring accessible, secure, and safe electoral processes.\n\nKey efforts and outcomes include:\n\n*   **Proactive Legislative Adaptation and Emergency Preparedness:** Recognizing the inherent difficulties in administering elections during emergencies, the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) proactively advised the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters (JSCEM) on necessary legislative amendments. The proposed changes, now formalized in the *Commonwealth Electoral (COVID Enfranchisement) Regulations 2022*, provide the Electoral Commissioner with essential flexibility to manage electoral processes (e.g., expanding postal or electronic voting, adjusting polling hours) while prioritizing voter and staff safety and maintaining public confidence. These regulations are designed as temporary measures, demonstrating a responsible and targeted response to the emergency, with safeguards like parliamentary scrutiny.\n*   **Successful Piloting and Learning from Experience:** The Eden-Monaro by-election served as a crucial test case, showcasing the AEC's agility and professionalism in a dual-emergency environment (bushfires and COVID-19). Post-election surveys revealed high voter and staff satisfaction with safety measures, validating the government's adaptive strategies. Key learnings from this event, such as the necessity of extensive inter-agency consultation (with Chief Medical Officers, police, health authorities) and the impact of health measures on operational costs, directly informed the planning for the federal election, ensuring continuous improvement and robust readiness.\n*   **Enhanced Accessibility and Voter Enfranchisement:** To ensure all eligible citizens could exercise their right to vote, the government implemented a multi-faceted approach. This included expanding the availability of pre-poll voting centres, dedicating teams to support vulnerable populations in aged care and hospitals, and, critically, introducing a secure telephone voting service for COVID-19 positive individuals unable to attend polling places. This service, clearly outlined in the \"Customer Journey\" document and the regulations, ensured anonymity while maintaining the integrity of the vote through stringent registration and verification processes. Measures for non-English speakers and those with disabilities were also prioritized, reflecting a commitment to inclusive participation.\n*   **Robust Communication and Transparency:** The government deployed comprehensive public information campaigns and clear communication strategies to inform voters about their options, new safety measures, and potential operational adjustments (e.g., longer wait times for emergency services). Detailed talking points and call centre scripts illustrate a consistent and reassuring message, designed to reduce voter anxiety and guide citizens through new processes, including how to provide proof of COVID-19 status for telephone voting. This proactive communication minimized confusion and maximized public awareness.\n*   **Unwavering Commitment to Electoral Integrity and Safety:** At every step, stringent measures were implemented to safeguard the integrity of the electoral process. This included real-time checks to prevent double voting, a two-step registration and voting process for telephone votes to ensure anonymity, and robust ballot paper handling and reconciliation procedures. Increased staffing at polling places, alongside the provision of PPE and enhanced hygiene protocols, underscored a paramount focus on public health. While these measures incurred additional costs (e.g., $30 million for PPE, increased staffing), they were deemed essential investments to protect lives and maintain trust in the democratic process, distinguishing Australia's approach from less successful international examples.\n*   **Comprehensive Operational Planning:** The extensive list of COVID-related files demonstrates the sheer breadth and depth of the government's planning, covering strategic management, occupational health and safety, communications, staffing, training, and technological development. The detailed Postal Voting policy further illustrates a meticulously planned approach to one of the most widely used alternative voting methods, including provisions for secure processing, timely delivery, and handling of special cases like silent electors.\n\nIn summary, these documents provide compelling evidence of the government's diligent, adaptable, and public-focused response to an unprecedented crisis, ensuring the fundamental right to vote was protected with integrity and safety for all Australians.", "model": "gemini-2.5-flash", "generated_at": "2025-06-22T14:18:52.615947", "source_hash": "5d58cc1fccab83e034cf056b4ff1e224d1da9fb2e8c5c5ebf6b69b8d647a198c", "raw_response_path": "data/llm_responses/LEX2846__overall__government_apologist__20250622T141852.json", "output_tokens": 826, "prompt_tokens": 51014, "total_tokens": 53677, "summary_length": 4919}, "short_index": {"text": "The released FOI documents unequivocally demonstrate the Australian government's exemplary leadership and unwavering commitment to democratic principles amidst the unprecedented challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Systemic Failure & Gross Incompetence in Emergency Preparedness (AEC Submission to JSCEM, November 2020):**\n\n*   **Profound Lack of Foresight:** Despite acknowledging federal elections as Australia's \"biggest peacetime logistical event,\" the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) was catastrophically unprepared for a foreseeable pandemic. Their November 2020 submission, almost a year into the global crisis, is a desperate plea for legislative changes that should have been proactively sought years prior, or at minimum, immediately after the pandemic's onset.\n*   **Blame Shifting and Evasion of Responsibility:** The AEC consistently externalizes blame, citing a \"complex environment\" and reliance on \"ministers and senior officials across governments.\" This abdication of leadership demonstrates a failure to secure autonomy or assert the criticality of electoral functions within government.\n*   **Pre-existing Failures Amplified:** The document admits \"existing challenges\" like difficulty recruiting temporary staff, supply chain vulnerabilities, limited premises, and inadequate access for disabled, overseas, regional, homeless, and Indigenous voters were merely \"exacerbated\" by COVID-19. This is a damning confession that fundamental electoral integrity and accessibility were compromised *before* the pandemic, with COVID-19 simply revealing the depth of these long-standing systemic inequities.\n*   **Legislative Inflexibility & Delayed Action:** The AEC's belated request for powers to \"extend reasons electors can postal or pre-poll vote,\" \"conduct an election solely by postal vote,\" or \"expand categories of electors who may utilise the electronic (telephone) voting method\" is a stark admission of its own reactive, rather than proactive, stance. The existing powers (Sections 240A, 241, 242) for suspending polling were deemed insufficient, highlighting a stunning lack of comprehensive legislative review or foresight in preparing for emergencies beyond simple \"anthrax scares.\" Their inability to leverage broader existing powers (Section 286) due to internal constraints further underscores their organizational paralysis.\n\n**II. Disenfranchisement, Financial Mismanagement, and Operational Chaos (Eden-Monaro By-election Analysis, AEC Submission):**\n\n*   **Disenfranchisement of Vulnerable Voters:** The \"decision not to conduct mobile polling for the event,\" forcing aged care facilities and hospitals onto postal voting, is a direct act of disenfranchisement. The abysmal \"9 per cent of postal votes sent to overseas electors were admitted to the count\" (compared to 33% previously) is irrefutable evidence of a catastrophic failure to ensure access for a specific, often geographically isolated, demographic.\n*   **Explosive Cost Overruns:** The by-election's cost \"almost doubling to $3.954 million\" due to \"additional polling locations... additional staff... PPE and other hygiene materials\" exposes gross financial mismanagement stemming from reactive, inefficient planning. The pre-emptive warning that the \"likely impact on the federal election budget is clear\" and that \"specialised materials... raise the cost... in excess of $30 million\" forebodes continued taxpayer waste.\n*   **Spin Over Substance:** The claim that the AEC \"aimed to reduce voter anxiety... by showing the AEC was prepared\" is a transparent attempt at public relations spin to mask fundamental unpreparedness. \"Awareness of the environmental context was key to the campaign\u2019s success\" prioritizes perception over actual operational effectiveness.\n*   **Rushed & Inadequate Training:** The need to \"adapt quickly to develop and deliver appropriate and relevant training\" in \"only three weeks\" highlights a last-minute scramble, suggesting the training was likely superficial and insufficient, compromising the integrity of the process.\n*   **Inefficient Operations & Unacceptable Wait Times:** Data revealing the \"ordinary vote issuing process took 16.5 seconds (or 46 per cent) longer\" points to severe inefficiency. The queue modelling exposing potential \"maximum queue\" times of \"55.42 minutes\" reveals an electoral system utterly incapable of maintaining acceptable service levels without exorbitant increases in staffing and resources, which itself incurs \"an estimated 30 per cent increase in polling staff required, costing approximately an additional $13 million.\"\n*   **Fundamental Logistical Failures:** Admissions of \"procurement lead times,\" \"supply chain risks,\" and \"significant challenges for bulk storage availability\" reveal a complete lack of basic logistical foresight and planning for essential election materials.\n\n**III. Bureaucratic Hurdles & Undermined Secrecy in Telephone Voting (Customer Journey, Regulations, Call Centre Scripts):**\n\n*   **Delayed, Restrictive, & Arbitrary Access:** The \"DRAFT v7\" of the \"Customer Journey\" in March 2022, just months before the election, indicates a protracted and incompetent development process. The \"Commonwealth Electoral (COVID Enfranchisement) Regulations 2022,\" undated in the final version but appearing in 2022, were clearly a last-minute legislative scramble.\n    *   The narrow eligibility window for telephone voting \u2013 \"after 6pm Tuesday 17 May\" then abruptly changed to \"after 6pm Friday 13 May\" days before the election \u2013 created deliberate confusion and limited access for genuinely sick voters.\n    *   The requirement for sick voters to provide highly specific proof (\"test centre location, date, time, and ref # from your health authority\" or \"RAT brand and serial number\") placed an unreasonable and discriminatory burden on individuals already suffering from illness.\n    *   The Ministerial power to \"specify matters\" for eligibility introduces political influence into what should be an independent electoral process.\n*   **Legalized Disenfranchisement & Self-Protection:** Regulation 7(1) explicitly states that the AEC is only required to provide telephone voting \"to the extent feasible,\" and Crucially, 7(4) declares \"Any failure to provide a telephone voting method... does not invalidate the result of a general election.\" This is a cynical legal shield designed to insulate the government and AEC from accountability for systemic failures and voter disenfranchisement.\n*   **Erosion of Secret Ballot & Voter Agency:** The telephone voting process, where a \"Service Officer records the voter\u2019s preference on the ballot papers,\" fundamentally compromises the secret ballot and removes direct voter agency. The reliance on a third-party transcriber introduces potential for error, bias, or even malicious manipulation, with only a weak \"read back\" safeguard. The declaration that \"it is irrelevant that the voter did not complete the ballot paper personally\" (Reg. 24(2)(c)) legalizes this profound breach of democratic principle.\n*   **Misleading Public Statements:** The \"Key Messaging\" and \"Call Centre Scripts\" falsely claim, \"The AEC voting assistant will not know the voter\u2019s name and address\" and \"Phone operators are not given your name, address, or phone number. They are only given registration numbers, to protect your privacy.\" This directly contradicts Regulation 23(1)(a), which requires the Divisional Returning Officer to \"find the name of the voter that corresponds to the registration number on the envelope\" for scrutiny. This deliberate obfuscation of the process demonstrates a willingness to mislead the public about the true extent of anonymity.\n*   **Inadequate Capacity & Blame-Shifting for Delays:** The call centre scripts repeatedly justify \"lengthy wait times\" by stating \"it\u2019s busy\" and \"This is an emergency service, and it\u2019s busy.\" This is an admission of woefully inadequate resourcing for a compulsory voting system. The passive aggressive suggestion that voters \"should be prepared for potentially long wait times\" places the burden of inconvenience and potential disenfranchisement directly onto the sick citizen.\n*   **Punishing the Ill & Helpers:** The regulations create an \"offence for false or misleading declaration\" (Reg. 26), effectively criminalizing honest mistakes by sick individuals. Furthermore, the penalty for an individual who \"assists the voter\" without the voter explicitly stating they \"require another individual\u2019s assistance\" (Reg. 15(2)) actively deters much-needed support for vulnerable voters. The \"strict liability\" offense for voting more than once (Reg. 27(3)) further criminalizes potentially confused or disoriented sick individuals.\n*   **Flawed Scrutiny and Lack of Transparency:** Regulations limiting scrutineers to the \"number of call centre operators\" (Reg. 20(2)) and criminalizing communication not \"reasonably necessary\" (Reg. 20(6)) severely curtail effective oversight. The contradictory statement that \"An audio recording must not be made... of a vote\" (Reg. 16(8)) undermines any claim of transparency or the ability for scrutineers to verify vote accuracy.\n*   **Abrupt Service Closures & Lack of Cohesion:** The internal memos show critical changes to registration eligibility and online portal closures happening just days before the election, indicative of a chaotic and uncoordinated rollout that actively hindered voter access.\n\nIn conclusion, these documents paint a damning picture of a government and its electoral body exhibiting systemic unpreparedness, reactive and incompetent decision-making, and a callous disregard for voter accessibility, particularly for vulnerable populations during a public health crisis. The measures implemented were often too late, too limited, unnecessarily burdensome, and characterized by a disturbing lack of transparency and a focus on legal self-preservation over democratic integrity. The financial implications highlight significant waste due to these fundamental failures in foresight and execution.", "model": "gemini-2.5-flash", "generated_at": "2025-06-22T14:19:47.772781", "source_hash": "5d58cc1fccab83e034cf056b4ff1e224d1da9fb2e8c5c5ebf6b69b8d647a198c", "raw_response_path": "data/llm_responses/LEX2846__overall__highly_critical__20250622T141947.json", "output_tokens": 2022, "prompt_tokens": 51011, "total_tokens": 59845, "summary_length": 10079}, "short_index": {"text": "This FOI overview exposes a shocking display of systemic failure and gross incompetence within the government and its electoral body, the AEC, during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The state compels individuals to participate in an activity under threat of penalty, regardless of their personal values, rational assessment of candidates, or desire to abstain. This is forced altruism, demanding a \"duty\" to the collective that supersedes individual choice.\n\nFurthermore, the \"COVID Enfranchisement\" regulations impose egregious infringements on personal autonomy. To vote by telephone, individuals are *forced* to **disclose private medical information** (positive COVID-19 test results, isolation directives, and associated reference numbers) to a government agency (AEC) as a prerequisite for exercising their right to vote. They are even required to \"keep records\" of this private health data for 40 days. This is a blatant overreach into an individual's private life, treating personal health status as a public commodity to be monitored and controlled by the state. The arbitrary and constantly shifting eligibility timelines for telephone voting (e.g., \"tested positive after 6pm Tuesday 17 May\") further demonstrate bureaucratic caprice, restricting rather than facilitating genuine individual choice.\n\nThe limitation of scrutineers at call centres to \"one per call centre operator\" significantly curtails the transparency essential for a free and fair electoral process. This undermines the individual's right to observe, fostering an environment where government actions can occur with reduced public oversight.\n\n**Rational Self-Interest and Productive Achievement:**\nThe \"emergency measures\" detailed in the documents lead directly to inefficiency and a suppression of productive achievement. The AEC's admission of \"potentially long wait times\" for telephone voting and the acknowledgment of \"frustration\" for callers highlight the inefficiency of a centrally planned, government-mandated service. Rational individuals seek to minimize wasted time and effort; these policies compel the opposite.\n\nThe significant financial burden imposed on taxpayers is another direct assault on rational self-interest. The Eden-Monaro by-election cost nearly double previous averages due to COVID measures, and federal election estimates include an additional $13 million for polling staff and over $30 million for PPE. These are costs extracted from the productive members of society to fund an inefficient, bureaucratic apparatus. This massive expenditure for \"safety\" measures, such as \"sneeze shields,\" single-use pencils, and \"Hygiene Officers,\" is a gross misallocation of resources that productive individuals could have invested more wisely for their own benefit.\n\nThe general reluctance to embrace readily available, efficient technologies, such as secure online voting, signifies a suppression of personal initiative and a preference for archaic, bureaucratically controlled methods. Despite public demand and the availability of technology, the AEC insists that \"no online voting for federal elections is available, regardless of personal circumstances,\" forcing citizens into less efficient, state-approved channels.\n\n**Dangers of Collectivism and Government Overreach:**\nThe entire \"COVID Enfranchisement Bill and Regulations\" package is a prime example of collectivist thought in action. The justification for these measures consistently revolves around ensuring \"confidence and trust in elections,\" \"the safety of voters and electoral officials,\" and the \"legitimacy of the result\"\u2014all collective values prioritized over individual freedom and autonomy.\n\nThe proposed legislative amendments, such as enabling the Electoral Commissioner to \"determine how certain electoral processes...may be undertaken\" and to \"adjourn or suspend polling, or provide for the temporary suspension or adjournment of other events,\" centralize immense power in the hands of a single bureaucratic entity. This is textbook government overreach, allowing an unelected official to dictate fundamental aspects of the electoral process, including \"close of rolls, nominations, early voting or scrutiny,\" thereby eroding the rule of law and individual control over political participation.\n\nThe pervasive coordination with \"Commonwealth, state or territory government agencies\" and the emphasis on \"conforming with federal and local health advice\" illustrate a government that views individuals as components of a collective to be managed, rather than sovereign entities. The detailed micromanagement of polling places, including mandates on queue control, hand sanitizer usage, and even the type of pencil used, exemplifies a \"nanny state\" mentality that dictates even the most trivial aspects of individual conduct.\n\nIn summary, these FOI documents lay bare an electoral system that has, under the pretext of a public health emergency, aggressively expanded its bureaucratic interference, compelled citizen action, and imposed arbitrary restrictions on individual liberty. The emphasis on collective \"safety\" and \"integrity\" has come at the expense of rational self-interest, productive achievement, and the fundamental right of individuals to live free from unwarranted government intrusion. This represents a dangerous and un-Objectivist trajectory where the state assumes ever-greater power over the lives of its citizens.", "model": "gemini-2.5-flash", "generated_at": "2025-06-24T02:14:55.983138", "source_hash": "5d58cc1fccab83e034cf056b4ff1e224d1da9fb2e8c5c5ebf6b69b8d647a198c", "raw_response_path": "data/llm_responses/LEX2846__overall__objectivist__20250624T021455.json", "output_tokens": 1034, "prompt_tokens": 51045, "total_tokens": 58035, "summary_length": 5751}, "short_index": {"text": "From an Objectivist perspective, these documents reveal a chilling expansion of government control that fundamentally assaults individual rights, rational self-interest, and productive achievement.
