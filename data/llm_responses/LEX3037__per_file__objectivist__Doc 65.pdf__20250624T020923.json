            "text": "This document, a \"NEWSROOM POST\" by Josh Machin, Head of Public Policy for Meta Australia, outlines Meta's comprehensive strategy to combat \"misinformation, election interference, and other forms of abuse\" on its platforms ahead of the 2022 Australian Election. Key initiatives include expanding its third-party fact-checking program (with RMIT FactLab, AFP, AAP), significantly reducing the distribution of content rated \"false,\" running media literacy campaigns, detecting and removing \"Coordinated Inauthentic Behaviour,\" and coordinating with the \"Government's election integrity assurance taskforce and security agencies.\" It also details mandatory transparency requirements for political and social issue ads, including government ID authorization, and efforts to encourage civic engagement, such as voter reminders and public data displays.\n\nWithin the context of the FOI request, this document serves as stark evidence of the \"systematic government overreach that directly assaults individual rights and rational self-interest,\" as articulated by Objectivist principles. Meta's actions, particularly its \"coordination with the Government's election integrity assurance taskforce,\" demonstrate how a private entity is being leveraged by the state to perform de facto censorship and control the marketplace of ideas, bypassing the legitimate governmental function of preventing fraud through force and instead presuming to dictate \"truth\" and police \"misleading\" information. This fundamentally corrupts laissez-faire principles by transforming a private platform into an agent of state-aligned information control, fostering \"intellectual dependency rather than sovereign thought.\"\n\nFrom an Objectivist perspective, the document reflects profound contradictions and assaults on core values:\n\n*   **Reason:** The strategy directly undermines individual reason and the uninhibited exchange of ideas. By establishing \"third-party fact-checkers\" to \"review and rate the accuracy of content\" and then \"significantly reduc[ing] its distribution\" if deemed false, Meta, in coordination with the government, posits itself as the arbiter of truth. This assumes that individuals are incapable of discerning truth through their own rational faculties and critical evaluation of diverse viewpoints. The \"media literacy campaigns\" and \"Don't be a Misinfluencer\" initiatives, while superficially appearing to empower, can be interpreted as attempts to indoctrinate users into accepting the approved framework of \"misinformation\" rather than fostering independent thought and the full intellectual autonomy necessary to navigate the complex world of information. The suppression of any \"misleading\" information, even if incorrect, prevents the necessary process of rational refutation, open debate, and the discovery of truth through intellectual competition.\n\n*   **Individualism:** The document demonstrates a profound disregard for individual rights and personal autonomy. The act of \"reducing distribution\" or labeling content as \"false\" is a form of censorship that directly infringes upon the individual's right to free expression, even the right to utter erroneous or unpopular ideas. The \"mandatory transparency for political, election and social issues ads,\" requiring \"government-issued photo ID\" and \"Paid for by\" disclaimers, chills free speech, particularly anonymous speech, which is a vital protection for individuals against potential reprisal for dissenting views. Furthermore, the \"coordinating with the Government's election integrity assurance taskforce and security agencies\" indicates a blurring of lines between private platforms and state coercion, eroding the individual's right to engage in political discourse free from state surveillance or indirect censorship facilitated by private companies.\n\n*   **Free Enterprise:** The collaboration between Meta and the \"Government's election integrity assurance taskforce\" fundamentally corrupts the principles of free enterprise in the marketplace of ideas. Instead of allowing a truly free market where ideas compete on their merits and individuals choose what to consume and believe, Meta is acting as an arm of state-aligned information control. The \"one-off grants to all our fact-checkers to increase their capacity\" demonstrate a subsidized, non-market mechanism for controlling information, moving away from voluntary exchange. The state's leveraging of a private platform for de facto censorship, bypassing due process and clear law, transforms the digital public square into a controlled, sanitized echo chamber, fundamentally distorting the market by imposing artificial constraints on the supply and demand of information.\n\n**Evidence of Bureaucratic Obstacles, Forced Altruism, or Suppression of Productive Achievement:**\n\n*   **Bureaucratic Obstacles:**\n    *   \"Significantly reduce its distribution\" and \"add a warning label with a link to a debunking article\" for content rated false, creating a gatekeeping mechanism that obstructs free information flow.\n    *   Mandatory \"authorisation process using government-issued photo ID\" and \"Paid for by\" disclaimers for political/social issue ads, which imposes a bureaucratic hurdle on political expression and restricts anonymous speech.\n    *   \"Coordinating with the Government's election integrity assurance taskforce and security agencies\" indicates an integration with government bureaucracy that can lead to directives or pressure on Meta's content policies.\n\n*   **Forced Altruism:**\n    *   RMIT FactLab's statement, \"We see this as a really important public service. If we can play a role in preventing the dissemination of misinformation on social media that has the potential to mislead or harm, then we see that as providing a really critical service,\" frames the activity as a selfless endeavor for the collective good (\"public service\"), implying a moral duty to enforce \"truth\" and prevent \"harm,\" rather than focusing on the objective value of open discourse.\n    *   Meta's overall framing of \"promoting safety and integrity\" and \"combating abuse, misinformation, and election interference\" implies an overarching mission to protect the collective at the expense of individual freedom of expression.\n\n*   **Suppression of Productive Achievement:**\n    *   The \"significant reduction of distribution\" for \"false\" content directly suppresses the dissemination of ideas, regardless of their intent or the potential for counter-argument. This stifles the uninhibited exchange of ideas—a core \"productive achievement\" of a free society.\n    *   The broader strategy of policing \"misinformation\" disincentivizes the creation and sharing of diverse viewpoints, including critical or unconventional ideas, which might be erroneously categorized as \"misleading.\" This creates a climate of self-censorship, hindering intellectual exploration and the development of new insights.\n    *   By turning Meta into a de facto enforcer of government-aligned information policy, the document reveals a system that \"foster[s] intellectual dependency rather than sovereign thought,\" thereby suppressing the ultimate productive achievement: the independently reasoning mind."

Analyze how the document reflects or contradicts the values of reason, individualism, and free enterprise. Note any evidence of bureaucratic obstacles, forced altruism, or suppression of productive achievement.\n\nTo aid you, the overview of the FOI request is: [REQUEST OVERVIEW START] The Australian Election Commission's \"Electoral Integrity Assurance Taskforce\" exemplifies a profound Objectivist concern, demonstrating a systematic government overreach that directly assaults individual rights and rational self-interest. Through its \"Electoral Communications Escalation Scenarios\" and collaboration with tech companies, the AEC usurps the individual's right to free expression—including anonymous speech—and presumes to dictate \"truth\" by policing \"misleading\" information and \"disrepute.\" This bureaucratic interference, far exceeding the legitimate government function of preventing fraud or direct force, actively suppresses personal freedom and productive achievement by stifling the uninhibited exchange of ideas and intellectual autonomy. Most egregiously, the state's leverage of private platforms for de facto censorship, bypassing due process and clear law, fundamentally corrupts laissez-faire principles, transforming the marketplace of ideas into a controlled, sanitized echo chamber and fostering intellectual dependency rather than sovereign thought.\n [REQUEST OVERVIEW END] \n\n--- MAIN DOCUMENT TEXT START ---\n\n\n\n--- Page 1 ---\n\nNEWSROOM POST – STRICTLY EMBARGOED UNTIL 12.01AM AEDT 15 MARCH 2022\n\nHow Meta is Preparing for the 2022 Australian Election\nBy Josh Machin, Head of Public Policy for Meta Australia\n\n● Meta has been preparing for this year’s Australian election for a long time and will be using a\ncomprehensive strategy to combat misinformation, election interference, and other forms of\nabuse on our platforms.\n\n● We’re expanding our third-party fact-checking program in Australia to include RMIT FactLab.\nThey’ll join Agence France Presse and Australian Associated Press to review and rate content.\nWe’ll also be providing one-off grants to all our fact-checkers to increase their capacity in the\nlead up to the election.\n\n● We’re also working with the Australian Associated Press to re-run the “Check the Facts” media\nliteracy campaign in three other languages - into Vietnamese, Simplified Chinese and Arabic to\nextend the benefits of the campaign even further.\n\nWith the Australian Election set to take place in the coming months, Meta has been preparing for them\nfor a long time. We’ve been involved in more than 200 elections around the world since 2017, and we’ve\nlearned key lessons from each one about where to focus our teams, technologies, and investments so\nthey will have the greatest impact. Here are some of the ways that we’re already promoting safety and\nintegrity across our platforms ahead of this year’s Australian Election.\n\nCombating Abuse, Misinformation, and Election Interference Using a Comprehensive Approach\n\nWe’ve made significant investments in safety and security, including approximately $5 billion/ $AU7\nbillion in 2021 alone and now have more than 40,000 people around the world working on safety and\nsecurity. These investments have allowed us to build our ability to reduce the likelihood of abuses -\nincluding election interference, misinformation and online harms - from happening in the first place,\nrather than just addressing them when they occur. For this year’s Australian election, this work will\ninclude:\n\n● Announcing a new Australian Fact-Checker. We know the importance of ensuring Australians\nhave access to reliable information about the election in Australia. Therefore, we are pleased to\nannounce the expansion of our third party fact checking program in Australia today. From March\n21, RMIT FactLab will join Meta’s global independent fact checking program in reviewing and\nrating the accuracy of content in the lead up to the 2022 Australian Election, alongside Agence\nFrance Presse and the Australian Associated Press. We'll also be providing one-off grants to all\nour fact-checkers to increase their capacity in the lead up to the election. Our fact checkers work\nto reduce the spread of misinformation across Meta’s services. When they rate something as\n\nReleased under the FOI ActReleased under the FOI Act\n\n\n--- Page 2 ---\n\nfalse, we significantly reduce its distribution so fewer people see it. We also notify people who\ntry to share something rated as false and add a warning label with a link to a debunking article.\n● Russell Skelton, Director of RMIT FactLab said, “We see this as a really important public service.\nIf we can play a role in preventing the dissemination of misinformation on social media that has\nthe potential to mislead or harm, then we see that as providing a really critical service.”\n\n● We are also working with expert organisations such as First Draft to increase monitoring for\nmisinformation in the lead-up to the election and publish related analyses and reporting on their\nwebsite. First Draft will also be providing pre-election training for Australian journalists on how\nto identify and prevent amplifying mis and dis information.\n\n● Empowering People to Identify False News. Since we know it’s not enough to just limit or\n\nremove harmful or misleading electoral misinformation that people see, we’re giving people\nmore context about a post so they can make an informed decision on what to read, trust and\nshare. We have invested in dedicated Australian initiatives including:\n\n○ Working with the Australian Associated Press to launch an education and awareness\ncampaign comprising a series of short videos modelling how people can recognise and\navoid misinformation by taking simple steps to 'Check the Facts'. The campaign will run\nagain this April and will include, for the first time, content translated in three other\nlanguages - Vietnamese, Simplified Chinese and Arabic to extend the benefits of the\ncampaign even further.\n\n○ Partnering with First Draft to develop the “Don’t be a Misinfluencer” campaign on\n\nFacebook and Instagram to help creators and influencers to share tips for spotting false\nnews.\n\nSecurity and election interference\n\n● Combatting Influence Operations. We have specialised global teams to identify and take action\nagainst threats to the election, including signs of coordinated inauthentic behaviour across our\napps. We are also coordinating with the Government's election integrity assurance taskforce and\nsecurity agencies in the lead up to the election. We’ve also improved our AI so that we can more\neffectively detect and block fake accounts, which are often behind this activity.\n\n○ Since 2017, we have removed over 150 networks around the world including ahead of\nmajor democratic elections. We’re working to find and remove any networks of\nCoordinated Inauthentic Behaviour. We’ll also share publicly what we find.\n● Protecting candidates and leaders running in the Australian election. In December 2021, we\nextended our Facebook Protect security program to Australia. The program has been rolled out\nto those who might be at a higher risk of being targeted online, such as candidates and public\nofficials, encouraging them to adopt stronger account security protections. We will also be\nrunning a Facebook security prompt to candidates and leaders to remind them to turn on two\nfactor authentication. We are working with the Australian Electoral Commission and political\nparties to run training sessions for all candidates on our policies and tools and how to keep safe\nin the lead up to the election.\n\nReleased under the FOI ActReleased under the FOI Act\n\n\n--- Page 3 ---\n\nEncouraging transparency around political, election and social issues ads\n\n● Mandatory transparency for political ads. Since the 2019 Australian Federal Election, we’ve\nmade a series of changes for advertisers in Australia that want to run electoral, political and\nsocial issue ads. Advertisers are now required to go through an authorisation process using\ngovernment-issued photo ID, and place a “Paid for by” disclaimers on their ads. This includes any\nperson creating, modifying, publishing or pausing ads that reference political figures, political\nparties or elections. It also includes social issue ads that seek to influence public opinion through\ndiscussion, debate or advocacy for or against important topics, such as civil and social rights,\ncrime, environmental politics, education or immigration. We launched these requirements for\nsocial issue ads last year, before the first possible election date, to ensure it was in place for the\nAustralian federal election. Any political, electoral or social issue ads on Facebook and Instagram\nthat do not have the correct authorisation or disclaimers will be removed from the platform and\narchived in a public Ad Library for seven years.\n\n● Allowing Australians to control their experience. While political and social issue ads play an\nimportant role in every election, people have told us they want the option to see fewer of them\nin their Facebook and Instagram feeds. Last year, we announced a new feature that gives people\nmore control by giving them the  choice to see fewer social issues, electoral, and political ads.\n\nEncouraging civic engagement and empowering voters\n\nWe want to do more than just prevent abuse on our platforms during elections. We also want to\nempower people to participate, so for this year’s Australian elections, we’re supporting civic engagement\nin a number of ways.\n\n● Developing products on the platform to encourage people to vote. Closer to election day we\nwill begin running notifications at the top of Facebook’s Feed for people over 18, reminding\nthem to vote, while also connecting them with reliable information about the voting process. We\nwill also be launching Instagram Stories elections stickers to celebrate and encourage voter\nengagement.\n\nReleased under the FOI ActReleased under the FOI Act\n\n\n--- Page 4 ---\n\nElection Day Reminder (example only)\n\n● Informing people about the latest election communications from political parties, journalists\nand the Australian Election Commission. We will release a public, Live Display on Crowdtangle\ndedicated to the Australian Election. The Live Display will provide real-time coverage of the most\nrecent communications about the election on Facebook and Instagram.\n\nAs we get closer to the Australian election, we’ll stay vigilant to emerging threats and take additional\nsteps if necessary to prevent abuse on our platform while also empowering people in Australia to use\ntheir voice by voting.\n\n++++\n\nAbout RMIT\n\nReleased under the FOI ActReleased under the FOI Act\n\n\n--- Page 5 ---\n\nRMIT FactLab is a research hub at RMIT University dedicated to debunking misinformation online and\ndeveloping critical awareness about its origins and spread.
