The complaint alleges that these platforms disseminate opinions on electoral matters without the required authorisation details, specifically noting the absence of a stated authorising party despite the content strongly suggesting a connection to the Liberal Party.\n\n**Relevance to FOI Request LEX3047:** This document is highly relevant as it is a public email complaint received by the AEC about electoral advertisements lacking authorisation, directly aligning with the core scope of the FOI request. The complaint explicitly targets \"RiteOn!\" platforms, which are specifically listed in the request overview as entities whose complaints were part of the released materials, and highlights the central issue of missing authorisation details on digital political advertising."

Do not include any conversational filler or preamble.To aid you, the overview of the FOI request is: [REQUEST OVERVIEW START] FOI Request LEX3047 obtained Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) documents concerning complaints made primarily in April and May 2019 about electoral advertisements lacking authorisation or being misleading. The released materials include public email complaints and the AEC's responses to various entities like \"Our Vote Our Community\" and \"Bass Deserves Better\" Facebook pages, \"RiteOn!\" website, and other media. The complaints predominantly highlighted the absence of required authorisation details on political advertising across digital and print platforms, with some also raising concerns about misleading \"community group\" portrayals or unauthorised paid ads. In response, the AEC consistently clarified 'electoral matter' and authorisation requirements under the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918, requested subjects to add necessary authorisations, cease distribution of non-compliant materials, and advised on potential penalties up to $25,200 for non-compliance, as well as obligations for \"disclosure entities.\"\n [REQUEST OVERVIEW END] \n\n--- MAIN DOCUMENT TEXT START ---\n\n\n\n--- Page 1 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 2 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 3 ---\n\nI look forward to hearing from you concerning actions the AEC will take concerning these matters.  \nYours sincerely, \n\nFrom: \nSent: Tuesday, 26 March 2019 3:57 PM \nTo: \nCc: \nSubject: Reporting an Unauthorised Website and Facebook Page (www.riteon.org.au) \n\n@aec.gov.au> \n\nDear \nWe are writing to notify you of our concerns that the website https://www.riteon.org.au/ and its \naccompanying Facebook page https://www.facebook.com/RiteOnAU, its twitter page \nhttps://twitter.com/RiteOnAU and instagram page https://www.instagram.com/RiteOnAU/   are not \nauthorised.
