It includes a cover page confirming its release under the Freedom of Information Act 1982 and a subsequent page detailing a comprehensive list of redaction codes. These codes outline the various categories of information (e.g., personal details, business information, internal operations, legal professional communication, irrelevant material) that may have been withheld or obscured in the broader set of documents released in response to FOI request LEX452.\n\n### Relevance to FOI Request LEX452\n\nWhile this specific document does not contain the core communications related to Zi Chun Wang's donor disclosures, it is an integral part of the overall LEX452 FOI release package. Its relevance lies in providing context and transparency regarding any redactions applied to the substantive documents. It explains the legal and administrative grounds under which information might have been withheld from the communications between the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) and Zi Wang concerning his 2013/2014 donor disclosure obligations, as described in the FOI request overview."
