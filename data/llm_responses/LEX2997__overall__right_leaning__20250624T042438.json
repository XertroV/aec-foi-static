            "text": "The disclosed FOI documents primarily detail an extensive investigation by the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) into complaints regarding Andrew Laming MP's use of numerous Facebook pages for political communication without proper authorization disclosures. From a politically right-leaning perspective, these documents reveal several concerning aspects related to economic efficiency, individual liberty, and limited government, while touching indirectly on national security.\n\n**Limited Government and Fiscal Responsibility:** The sheer volume of internal communications, legal advice requests (many heavily redacted under legal professional privilege, s42), and ongoing \"ELT Weekly Reporting\" dedicated to this single matter highlights a significant bureaucratic expenditure. An investigation of this scale into alleged technical breaches of electoral authorization laws on social media raises questions about the efficient allocation of taxpayer resources. The internal AEC documents themselves note public skepticism, with comments such as \"don't expect AEC to do anything\" or suggestions of \"corruption\" due to perceived inaction or lack of authority. This public perception, coupled with the substantial internal administrative effort, suggests a potential for bureaucratic overreach and questionable fiscal responsibility where the cost of oversight may disproportionately outweigh the severity of the alleged non-compliance. The requirement for individuals to incur costs in complying with information requests (s321F notices) further burdens the private sector to satisfy government regulatory demands.\n\n**Individual Liberty and Freedom of Speech:** The core of the investigation revolves around the application of electoral laws broadened in 2018 to cover social media. This expansion represents an increased government regulatory footprint over political communication. The AEC's mandate to ensure political matter is \"properly authorised or removed\" implies a power to dictate or suppress political speech if authorization standards are not met. The issuance of formal notices (s321F) compelling Dr. Laming and third parties (like Facebook) to provide extensive data, including historical page content and internal communications, constitutes a notable intrusion into individual digital activities. While ostensibly for transparency, this level of government scrutiny and demand for private digital data can be seen as stifling to free expression and an erosion of individual digital liberty, moving beyond ensuring fair elections to regulating the minutiae of online political engagement.\n\n**National Security:** While the primary focus is domestic electoral compliance, one peripheral document within the AEC's internal communications references broader cyber threats, facial recognition technology, and foreign interference in online spaces. This suggests an awareness of national security implications in the digital realm within the AEC. However, the Laming investigation itself is not framed as a national security matter, raising a question as to whether resources are being optimally directed to electoral integrity versus more significant cyber threats, or if there is a subtle \"mission creep\" into areas that might be better handled by dedicated national security agencies.\n\nIn summary, the documents portray a government agency expending considerable resources on extensive regulatory enforcement concerning online political communication, potentially at the expense of fiscal efficiency and individual digital liberty. The broadening of regulatory scope and the intrusive nature of data requests represent a deviation from conservative principles advocating for limited government intervention and robust individual freedoms."

Drawing to your attention as the article contains the following:  The Bowman MP, who is on leave from parliament to undertake empathy counselling following complaints about his behaviour towards women, uses the sites to promote political material and attack his Labor opponents through pages classified with Facebook as “community” and “news” groups. None of the pages include political authorisation disclosures. According to the Australian Electoral Commission, political authorisation is required for “information that is a matter communicated, or intended to be communicated, for the dominant purpose of influencing the way electors vote in a federal election”. Evan is out today but my understanding is the AEC was not approached for comment prior to this article being published.  No action required at this stage, but I would expect this to trigger some complaints or enquiries.\n\n\n--- Page 2 ---\n\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 1 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 2 ---\n\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 1 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 2 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 3 ---\n\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 1 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 2 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 3 ---\n\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 1 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 2 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 3 ---\n\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 1 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 2 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 3 ---\n\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 1 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 2 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 3 ---\n\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 1 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 2 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 3 ---\n\nAEC.0002.0001.1108\n\nDownload the Guardian app for Android and iOS This e-mail and all attachments are confidential and may also be privileged.

According to reporting and data reviewed by BuzzFeed News, more than 7,000 individuals from nearly 2,000 public agencies nationwide have used Clearview AI to search through millions of Americans’ faces, looking for people, including Black Lives Matter protesters, Capitol insurrectionists, petty criminals, and their own friends and family members.

Authorities attributed the seizures to the alleged decryption of half a billion messages sent using Sky ECC, a now shut down encrypted phone company and network popular among drug traffickers.

The response simply confirms our investigation of the matter and otherwise provides minor extraneous details re application of the law. Receipt has been acknowledged & we can expect a follow-up article very soon with AEC investigation as a lead.  Twitter activityThere is a reasonable level of Twitter activity on the matter off the back of tweets like the ones below. The general response in relation to the AEC – from members of the public - is a mixture of “don’t expect AEC to do anything”, “the AEC is biased so won’t take action” and “they don’t have any power to take action”.  As is standard on the channel – purple signs have been raised a number of times.  We will monitor Twitter traffic and provide some select responses – based on the below enquiry response.

Firms urge Covid minimum wage delayLow-paid workers in COVID-stressed industries could be hit by a second year of delayed minimum wage increases as the Fair Work Commission examines whether to again stagger pay rises for 2.2 million workers across the next financial year.Citing the winding up of the JobKeeper scheme and doubts over the vaccination rollout, employers in hard-hit sectors are urging the commission to either impose a 12-month minimum wage freeze or delay pay increases in industries adversely impacted by the COVID-19 economic shock by up to seven months.READ MORE: Pricing workers out of jobs would hold back recovery |  PM shelves vaccination targets | Recovery on track despite rollout delay  | Union calls for minimum wage for fruit pickers |  How Fair Work justifies $13 wage rise |  Wage rise ‘an assault on small business’Now that the vaccine rollout has been disrupted potentially, the most affected industries will continue to be the most affected and should not be forced to incur two wage increases within five months.WES LAMBERT, RESTAURANT AND CATERING2. Coronavirus briefing: PM shelves jab targets; Recovery on track despite rollout delay; ‘Please explain’ on hotel quarantine\n\n\n--- Page 3 ---\n\nAEC.0002.0001.1596\n\nPrime Minister Scott Morrison says it is not possible to know whether every Australian will receive a vaccine shot before the end of the year, saying the federal government has no plans to set new targets. Keep up with the latest in our live blog.A further delay to the national vaccine rollout means most Australians will not enjoy a return to pre-COVID normality until early next year, but economists are confident the latest news around the AstraZeneca jab will not be enough to meaningfully “shift the dial” on the pace of the recovery.Another coronavirus case has been added to Queensland’s COVID-19 tally after it was revealed a woman who attended a party in Byron Bay last month tested positive. Health authorities have been quick to assure the community the newly identified case poses no risk to the public, as the patient had been in self isolation.And Victoria’s opposition has called for the state’s Auditor-General to investigate why contracts to operate the state’s hotel quarantine scheme were given to security operators, including one that was linked to a $4.5m collapse.\n\n\n--- Page 4 ---\n\nAEC.0002.0001.1597\n\nPrivate security contractors were directly responsible for triggering Victoria’s catastrophic second wave, resulting in the deaths of more than 800 Victorians, 250,000 job losses and immeasurable social and economic harms.DAVID SOUTHWICK, OPPOSITION POLICE SPOKESMAN3. The outsiders: How Prince Philip and Diana were alike\n\n\n--- Page 5 ---\n\nAEC.0002.0001.1598\n\nViewed through the prism of the woke, gender-fluid, cancelled culture of the 2020s, Prince Philip seems an anachronism: epitomising the rigidity of the British establishment of which he was at the heart, writes Anne Barrowclough. In fact it was Philip who dragged the monarchy out of the 19th century, who encouraged Britons to see themselves as innovators, who despised the stuffy elitism of the world he entered on his marriage to the young Princess Elizabeth.Even before the royal wedding in 1947 and in the early years of Elizabeth’s monarchy, the young naval officer was seen as the Princess Diana of his times; a modernising force, the man who would, some hoped and others dreaded, drive a musty establishment into the 20th century.IN OTHER NEWS:Too many Indigenous kids jailed: police chiefWar hero ‘buried proof of lewd conduct’Accused lawyer ‘invited to leave’Laming defies PM by seeking preselectionStrewth!: Turnbull tucks in for a busy week aheadWORLD: Charles delivers tribute to his ‘dear papa’Philip tired of ‘royalty nonsense’ at schoolVolcanic ash covers island then floats off to BarbadosBiden moves on Supreme ‘stack’4.

In Commentary todayFederalism grounds our entire system of government, and COVID has transformed it, possibly permanently, changing the game like Kerry Packer changed cricket, leaving the states in charge, writes Greg Craven.Anonymity has given trolls free rein to defame without incurring financial penalty or reputational risk. But the victims of slander on social media are fighting back, led by Peter Dutton, writes Jennifer Oriel.Dutton tolerated his abusers for many years, but after Greens senator Larissa Waters dubbed him an ‘inhuman, sexist rape apologist’ on Twitter, he appeared to reach his limit. JENNIFER ORIEL\n\n\n--- Page 7 ---\n\nAEC.0002.0001.1600\n\nThe Editorial: The principle that all employees are entitled to at least a minimum wage — the lowest amount they can be paid for their work — is an accepted part of workplace relations in Australia. Those workers, traditionally, all receive a pay rise at the same time. A second year of delaying pay rises for workers in sectors experiencing economic hardship could set a precedent, one that unions would oppose vehemently. But it would bring some flexibility to workplace relations and link wage rises to employers’ ability to pay, which would help struggling small businesses.Delve into Letters to the Editor here.6.

Coronavirus briefing: Job vacancies hit 12-year record; ‘Act on jab or lose economic war’; Green light for rapid COVID test\n\n\n--- Page 3 ---\n\nAEC.0002.0001.1664\n\nNational job vacancies are at a 12-year high  even though the number of people on JobSeeker is 500,000 more than before the arrival of COVID-19. Job vacancies surged by 19 per cent — or 38,200 — to 238,700 in March, new data from the National Skills Commission shows. Hospitality industry giant Merivale, which employs about 2500 people, including chef Michael Luo, Chee Chan and Auxane Lebon, pictured above at Mr Wong restaurant in Sydney, is looking to hire a further 200 staff, according to its head of human resources, Jessica Furolo.Business is demanding the Morrison government commit to a new timeline for the COVID-19 vaccine rollout and reconsider taxpayer-funded industry support, warning Australia “risks losing the economic war” as other countries plan their reopening.

Among other beneficiaries was Nick Llewellyn, self-described as the barrister’s “virtual son”.Judge Geoff Lindsay accepted in a decision handed down late on Monday that Rofe had knowledge of his actions and was not unduly influenced by others when he signed his final will in December 2014, despite his health being in serious decline after he had been diagnosed with dementia four years earlier.IN OTHER NEWS: PM getting warmer on net-zero targetWatchdog eyes US ad tech fight with GoogleElite journal under fire over ‘racism’LNP dumps Laming from seatUnion’s Qantas case up in the airWORLD: Blinken opens twin attack on ChinaMinneapolis cops shoot dead black motoristJunta’s killing of the news would do North Korea proudBali to be shut down for festival4.

If you want to spread misinformation, you get on Facebook and do it. Doesn't having real news and public interest journalism on your platform, give your platform at least some credibility? There must be value in that.Mr Milner : There is certainly value, as we address the issue of misinformation, in directing people to credible news sources. When our third-party fact-checking partners have identified and labelled content as likely false then we will direct people to credible news sources. That can be from the fact-checking organisation or other organisations. You say we have a reputation for being full of fake news, but that's actually not borne out by the facts. We can very much provide on notice information to the committee where credible, independent third-party academics have demonstrated that actually there is not a lot of fake news on Facebook.CHAIR: You talk about how you're dealing with misinformation. I want to ask you a specific question in relation to pages that are set up. We know that currently the AEC is investigating Andrew Laming's use of Facebook. I understand he has operated over 30 pages by logging on through his own account. Why isn't this captured by your transparency measures? Is that a loophole that people have been able to use? You get to say you still have transparency, but users who want to promote rubbish can do so without accountability.Mrs Garlick : I'm happy to share more information about how pages work and how people can administer pages. Certainly any person can administer a large number of pages if they wish to, but all of those pages do have to comply with our policies. If they're administered by fake accounts, for example, when we remove the fake accounts then the pages will come down. If the pages are sharing other content that violates our policy then we will also remove those posts that violate our policies. If there are enough posts that are removed from a particular page then the overarching page may come down. We also have teams that investigate whether pages are being operated in a coordinated way. We can do removals and takedowns based on coordinated inauthentic behaviour.CHAIR: Does 30 pages being operated by one member of parliament raise any flags for Facebook? Why was that allowed to happen?Mrs Garlick : Obviously we apply our policies and try to make sure that we are enforcing them [inaudible] policies. We also respond to requests from different regulators when they have questions or concerns. I don't think we would necessarily look into whether a particular person's profession is relevant to how they're administering a page. Certainly one person can administer a number of pages. The question is whether the accounts used to do that and the content that has been shared on that comply with our policies and applicable law.\n\n\n--- Page 2 ---\n\nAEC.0002.0001.1719\n\nCHAIR: So there's no way that Facebook's transparency measures have been able to capture the misuse of Facebook and the fake promotion of groups by members of parliament?Mrs Garlick : I feel that's a very conclusory statement. We've been enforcing our policies consistently. We're responding to requests from regulators. I'm not sure that we can make a declaratory statement like that. Certainly from our perspective we've been actively enforcing our policies and providing transparency in that regard.CHAIR: The AEC has asked for information about Mr Laming's activities on your platform. Are you cooperating fully?Mrs Garlick : Yes.CHAIR: And how many pages did Mr Laming operate unbeknown to the public?Mrs Garlick : The number of pages that any particular person administers is a question that is best directed to them. That's not something we can disclose.CHAIR: Do you think there is a responsibility for Facebook, if you have transparency measures for politicians, that this type of information, in and of itself, is part of those transparency measures?Mrs Garlick : To date, the transparency that people have sought in relation to politicians—obviously we've got general page transparency measures so that you can see when a page is created. You can see any page name changes. You can see how many admins there are and the countries in which they're located. We have listened to feedback that there can be greater transparency around pages and provided that. With respect to political issues, we tend to get feedback and there tends to be regulatory measures around political advertising. So we've been rolling out a number of measures, including here in Australia, to ensure that there is transparency around political advertising. That includes the ad library, where you can go in and see political ads and information of that nature.CHAIR: But you know that Andrew Laming is a member of parliament, that he is a politician?Mrs Garlick : Yes.CHAIR: Facebook has all of the data and is aware of how many other pages he has established? You have all of that information, don't you?Mrs Garlick : I assume yes. It's not something that we look at, no.CHAIR: Do you think that the public have a right to know?Mrs Garlick : In terms of transparency around page administrators, that hasn't been something that people have typically been requesting of us or that there has been public debate about. To date, that transparency around page administrators has been around the date it was created, any page name changes, and where it is being administered from. And then, in response to political issues, it's been a strong focus on political advertising. Those have been the areas of most concern from regulators, community groups and academics to date, and those have been the areas that we've focused on.CHAIR: Do you think this information not being transparent is in good faith with the transparency measures that the public understands—who a politician is and what money\n\n\n--- Page 3 ---\n\nAEC.0002.0001.1720\n\nthey are spending on advertising? To be able to keep secret the establishment of fake community pages—surely that's not in line with your transparency goals.Mrs Garlick : Our transparency measures to date have been focused on removals, under our community standards enforcement report; on giving people more information about pages so they can understand the nature of a particular page; and, more broadly, around political advertising campaigns.CHAIR: I understand that. But if you want the community to believe that Facebook is actually invested in transparency then surely this type of information should be available.Mrs Garlick : If that is something the Australian parliament wants to make a recommendation on, we are happy to work with government to make sure that we are responding to community expectations around further transparency measures.Senator FARUQI: In an international investigation published in December 2019 The Guardian newspaper revealed what it characterised as 'a covert plot to control some of Facebook's largest far-right pages, including one linked to a right-wing terror group, and create a commercial enterprise that harvests Islamophobic hate for profit'. Prominent Muslim politicians were targeted with thousands of Islamophobic and racist comments, including me. I am assuming that you remember that investigation. Could you briefly outline what steps Facebook has taken since that investigation took place to ensure that this sort of profit-driven hate cannot proliferate?Mr Milner : Hello, Senator; it's nice to meet you. I'm sorry about your personal experience of being attacked in this way. Because it wasn't notified to us before the hearing we've not prepared for detailed questions about this, but certainly we can write to you and committee on notice to explain the actions that we've taken with respect to that particular report. What we can perhaps talk about today is our broader approach towards addressing hate speech and incitement to violence on Facebook, if you'd find that helpful.Senator FARUQI: I was particularly interested in steps taken after this particular report. It was huge. A number of politicians really faced hatred and abuse. I think there were 500,000 followers of one particular page who unleashed their attack on me. So I'm particularly interested in what steps you took after 2019, in particular, to make sure that this doesn't happen again.Mr Milner : I will turn to Mia in a moment to see if she has anything specific on this. I know we've taken a number of steps since then to address particular groups organising in Australia and New Zealand. So Mia can talk a little bit about that. There's a range of different things that do to address the problem of hate speech, and it combines human expertise and technology. Some of that human expertise is about dangerous organisations. We have a specific team which just focuses on dangerous organisations around the world. It conducts research and engages with academics, different institutions and organisations to really understand what is going on here, how these organisations are changing and how they are manifesting online, so that we can find them, ban them, remove all their content and remove their supporters.We also use technology to find hate speech. That technology has got much, much better. It's called machine learning. Essentially, you feed into the machine enormous amounts of content such that it then knows what to look for. Our most recent enforcement report, where we provided information on this, has shown that, using this technology, we now manage to get to 97 per cent of hate speech before anybody reports it to us and take it down. Just three years ago that was less than 30 per cent. So this technology has got a lot better.\n\n\n--- Page 4 ---\n\nAEC.0002.0001.1721\n\nOur investment in people, including people from many different countries and communities with lots of different languages and experience, also enables us to get to this content. But it's not perfect and we have, frankly, bad people and hateful people who want to try to use platforms like ours, Twitter, TikTok and others to try to spread their manifestos of hate. So we've got to keep working at this, in order to get better at it. Mia, perhaps you can explain some of the actions we've taken around particular organisations.Senator FARUQI: Before we go to Mrs Garlick, I would just explain very quickly that I'm asking about this because my office has looked at the Australian pages identified if that particular Guardian investigation. and it appears that at least four of the six identified pages are still public, with some of them still posting Islamophobia content from websites identified in the investigation and the type of content which The Guardian characterised as ranging from misleading to outright fabrications. Does that surprise you?Mr Milner : I would need to look into it, Senator, in order to understand the specifics there. If your office could send to my team in Australia the details that they've dug up, we will look at it immediately.Senator FARUQI: But isn't that the problem? There was this huge investigation, and you haven't even taken down those pages. The largest of the Australian pages identified in that investigation, 'No Sharia law—Never, ever give up Australia', has over 100,000 followers. In the last 24 hours, that page has linked to articles posted by the third-party websites identified in that investigation, which are The Politics Online and Free Press Front. These are two of the near-identical websites masquerading as news sites with generic titles that were identified in The Guardian as posting reams of Islamophobic content. At that time, I might remind you, Facebook said that it would deal with these problems of hate speech and what it called 'coordinated inauthentic behaviour'. So I'm really shocked and very surprised—why on earth are these pages still up and linking to the same websites that created that mass factory of hate?Mr Milner : I'll ask Mia to come in and just talk a little bit more about what we've done in Australia, but one thing that's a really tricky area for us is how to enable people to debate issues, including about religions—and we think it's absolutely right that people should be able to debate the rights and wrongs of different religions—without attacking individuals who are members of those faiths. That's a very difficult area—Senator FARUQI: Debating issues is very different to spouting hate and attacking people.Mr Milner : I agree, and figuring out how to draw the line is one of the hardest challenges. But perhaps Mia could just talk about some of the actions we've taken specifically in Australia on this issue.Mrs Garlick : Senator, I think it would be really helpful if you could you share some links to some of the pages that you have concerns about, because, to build on Simon's remarks, it's often quite granular in terms of our assessments in terms of what content gets removed and then when that actually results in a page getting removed. It sounds as though it would be helpful for us to work that through with your office. Please always feel free to let us know the moment that you have concerns about things. We've certainly established a hate speech advisory council to make sure that we're continuing to listen to Australian community groups about issues and concerns that that they have as we continue our work both in enforcing our policies and in rolling out programs to address issues of this nature.\n\n\n--- Page 5 ---\n\nAEC.0002.0001.1722\n\nSenator FARUQI: Sure, we can talk to you directly about that, but they have been available for more than two years now, with that investigation. Just coming back to the Christchurch attack on the mosque, I'm assuming you've read the relevant parts of the Christchurch royal commission report that related to Facebook, because there is quite a chunk in that report about Facebook. The royal commission report makes reference, again, to several Facebook pages and groups that the terrorist interacted with, including the United Patriots Front, the Lads Society and the True Blue Crew. I understand, from media reports, that the United Patriots Front page was taken down in 2017. Are there Facebook pages or groups that currently exist at this point for those groups named in the Christchurch report?Mrs Garlick : Those ones that you've just mentioned have all been removed from our services. We do have this process, which I think Simon mentioned, where we try to review different types of groups that could potentially be considered organised hate and dangerous organisations. So a number of the groups that have been mentioned there have already been removed from our services following those assessments.Senator FARUQI: Do the administrators of those groups still have Facebook accounts and are they administering any pages currently? Do you have that sort of information?Mrs Garlick : I'm not sure that we necessarily have that information. The way that it works is that we do look at both groups and individuals, and so there have been certain specific individuals that we have designated to not be allowed to have a presence on our service, and then there are particular groups. It's an assessment at both the profile and group level.Senator FARUQI: Mr Milner, I think you did explain a little bit about how you take down these groups. But I'm interested in whether there is a threshold and what kind of decision-making process you go through in deciding which pages to remove and which not to remove. Is there a very quick answer to that? If not, you can take it on notice.Mr Milner : I'd like to take that on notice. We'd very much like to meet with you and take you through that and perhaps introduce you to some of our expert team, who can explain to you and your team and any other colleagues in the Senate who are interested how we go about doing this.Senator FARUQI: What happens to the profits that you've made on ads placed alongside extreme right-wing content that is later removed?Mr Milner : That's not how our advertising works. People don't place ads against content. It's not like YouTube in that sense. It's kind of meaningless, really, to think about it like that on Facebook.Senator FARUQI: What have you done with the profits from ads that were placed alongside the pages you have take down?Mr Milner : Again, that's not how it works; you can't advertise on Facebook pages. Adverts are directed at people, not content. It's simply not the case that ads are placed on pages like that.Senator FARUQI: But people would be coming to those pages to see those ads?Mr Milner : No. There are no ads on pages or in groups.Senator FARUQI: I understand that you have tools that automatically remove some comments. I think you explained that—the machine learning kind of stuff. They remove\n\n\n--- Page 6 ---\n\nAEC.0002.0001.1723\n\ncomments and posts from Facebook, including death threats, without the admin of the page necessarily seeing them—is that correct?Mr Milner : I'm not sure. I'd have to get back to you in respect of whether we remove content from their page. I'm pretty certain they would be, but I want to be absolutely certain for you. We can come back to you on that.Senator FARUQI: Could you take the next question on notice as well. If they are taken off, the admin doesn't see it. But I guess my concern is that, as public figures who receive these sorts of terrible messages, we are advised to report all threats because they are the best predictors of actual violence. This is what we have been told. I would like to know how we are meant to do that if they are automatically removed and the administrators don't know about it and can't keep a record of it.Mr Milner : I will confirm this. But I suspect that, given that we will also take action when a page has accumulated a significant number of strikes, they will be notified. We will look at that and share it with you on notice.CHAIR: There are some questions you have been given notice. Thank you for appearing today. We look forward to hearing some of those responses in due course. Thanks very much.Proceedings suspended from 12:27 to 13:43 https://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/search/display/display.w3p;query=Id%3A%22committees%2Fcommsen%2F631abdc2-b2bd-4d7c-bd1d-fb56f3d39c95%2F0003%22\n\n\n\n--- Page 1 ---\n\nAEC.0002.0001.1728\n\nFrom:                                 Justin SowdenSent:                                  Wed, 14 Apr 2021 13:02:23 +1000To:                                      Louise ParrottSubject:                             RE: Laming Facebook pages [SEC=OFFICIAL]Hi Louise Please find the following:         Redlands Institute (https://www.facebook.com/RInstit/) is still available and not authorised         Redlands Hospital: Let’s fight for fair funding (https://www.facebook.com/RedlandHospital/) is no longer available         Thornlands 4164 (https://www.facebook.com/ThornlandsQLD/) is no longer available         Redland Bay Bulletin (https://www.facebook.com/RedlandBulletin) is still available and now authorised by Andrew Laming.

The new target of an unemployment rate between 4% and 5% will mean about 200,000 more Australians in work than the old target adopted in last year’s budget of an unemployment rate “comfortably below 6%”.The Treasurer says he won’t begin to tighten the budget settings until that happens.

It will be intriguing to see how this slick TV show — built on US histories of drag — approaches the Australian drag tradition.What were the Spartans like? Note to Lego Masters: they didn’t build city wallsDuncan Keenan-Jones, The University of Queensland In a recent episode of Lego Masters, contestants were asked to build a castle in the style of the Spartans. It had white city walls — but the real Spartans famously refused to build a wall.Politics + SocietyAs pressure builds on India’s Narendra Modi, is his government trying to silence its critics?Usha M. Rodrigues, Deakin University As India's COVID crisis deepens, the government is taking a harder line with any social media content it finds objectionable.As boundaries between work and home vanish, employees need a ‘right to disconnect’Barbara Pocock, University of South Australia Victoria Police recently won the rights not to be contacted out of work hours. They are not the only employees who need a proper break from work.\n\n\n--- Page 9 ---\n\nAEC.0002.0001.2841\n\nHealth + MedicineEven if Olympians are jumping the COVID vaccine queue, that’s not necessarily wrong.

But it doesn’t make it OKAlison Poulton, University of Sydney Impulsiveness, a key characteristic of ADHD, might help us understand some of Laming's behaviour. None of this excuses his actions, though.More than half of Australians will experience trauma, most before they turn 17. We need to talk about itMeera Atkinson, University of Notre Dame Australia Now, for the first time in Australian history, trauma is trending in the wider public discourse. What does this shift in public consciousness mean, and where is it taking us?‘We always come last’: Deaf people are vulnerable to disaster risk but excluded from preparednessEmma Calgaro, University of Sydney; Dale Dominey-Howes, University of Sydney; Leyla Craig, University of Sydney Those with disaster experience said they hadn't received proper warnings, which led to confusion, helplessness and panic. There was a sense that 'we always come last'.

Procurement Updated 10/05/2021 2:08 PM Contact Andrew Johnson, Chief Legal Officer Printed 10/05/2021 2:08 PM  ELECTORAL AUTHORISATIONS –  CURRENT INVESTIGATIONS Commissioner’s summary Issue What is the AEC doing about the approximately 30 Facebook pages run by Andrew Laming MP that may not comply with the Electoral Act? Position The Facebook pages are currently under investigation by the AEC. It would not be appropriate to comment further. Points • The Electoral Act was amended in March 2018 to broaden the authorisation requirements to cover certain electoral mater communicated on social media. • The AEC proactively investigates electoral communications on referral and from our own investigations. If issues are found, the AEC contacts political participants to ensure that electoral matter is properly authorised or removed. • The Electoral Act does not regulate the content of political messages. Talking points Question: What is the AEC doing about the approximately 30 Facebook pages administered by Andrew Laming MP as reported in The Guardian? • The Facebook pages purportedly created and/or administered by Andrew Laming MP are currently under investigation by the AEC therefore it would not be appropriate to comment further.\n\n\n--- Page 368 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 369 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 370 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 371 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 372 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 373 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 374 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 375 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 376 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 377 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 378 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 379 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 380 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 381 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 382 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 383 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 384 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 385 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 386 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 387 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 388 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 389 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 390 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 391 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 392 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 393 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 394 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 395 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 396 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 397 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 398 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 399 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 400 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 401 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 402 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 403 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 404 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 405 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 406 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 407 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 408 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 409 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 410 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 411 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 412 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 413 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 414 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 415 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 416 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 417 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 418 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 419 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 420 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 421 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 422 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 423 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 424 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 425 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 426 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 427 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 428 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 429 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 430 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 431 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 432 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 433 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 434 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 435 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 436 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 437 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 438 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 439 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 440 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 441 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 442 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 443 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 444 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 445 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 446 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 447 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 448 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 449 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 450 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 451 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 452 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 453 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 454 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 455 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 456 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 457 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 458 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 459 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 460 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 461 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 462 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 463 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 464 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 465 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 466 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 467 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 468 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 469 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 470 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 471 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 472 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 473 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 474 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 475 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 476 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 477 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 478 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 479 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 480 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 481 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 482 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 483 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 484 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 485 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 486 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 487 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 488 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 489 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 490 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 491 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 492 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 493 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 494 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 495 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 496 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 497 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 498 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 499 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 500 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 501 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 502 ---\n\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 1 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 2 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 3 ---\n\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 1 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 2 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 3 ---\n\nAEC.0002.0001.4445\n\nPage 3Agenda Paper: Electoral Integrity CommitteePrepared by: Justin Sowden, Senior Lawyer, Legal Services13 May 2021Cleared by:Andrew Johnson, Chief Legal Officer14 May 2021Cleared by (ELT): First name Last name, ELT TitleSelect dateAttachments: Name of attachments\n\n\n\n--- Page 1 ---\n\nAEC.0002.0001.4446\n\nFrom:                                 Media MonitoringSent:                                  Fri, 14 May 2021 09:00:36 +1000To:                                      Megan MackieSubject:                             Daily media monitoring summaries -

Michael McCormack MP Minister for Small Business Federal Member for Riverina  Dr Andrew Laming MP Federal Member for Bowman  MEDIA RELEASE ENDS  Media Contacts:  McCormack – Dom Hopkinson 0428 373 122 Laming – Penny Donald – 0410 556 760 13 April 2017  BOON FOR BOWMAN’S SMALL BUSINESSES   FEDERAL Member for Bowman Andrew Laming hosted Minister for Small Business Michael McCormack in Cleveland today holding a roundtable with local small businesspeople and community leaders.   “I am pleased the Minister accepted my invitation to visit Bowman and to meet local businesspeople to discuss how the Government’s small business plan will help them grow and create local jobs,” Dr Laming said.   “Today, we discussed cuts to small business taxes and the instant asset write off programme which the Government has delivered to free-up resources for small businesses to reinvest and grow.   “We also discussed new trade opportunities and export markets small businesses can tap into following the Government’s successful negotiation of trade agreements with South Korea, Japan and China.   “Small businesspeople were also interested to hear about the Government’s changes to competition policy and new laws we have introduced to ensure multinationals pay their fair share of tax – all of which are levelling the playing field for small businesses to compete on their merits.”  Minister McCormack said the Government’s small business plan was a centre-piece for economic growth and job creation.   “The Government’s small business plan is focused on driving economic growth in local communities and in the national economy,” Mr McCormack said.   “Small businesses employ more than five and a half million Australians and contribute more than $380 billion in GDP every year, making it a vital sector in our economy.   “It is great to be here today with Andrew Laming to discuss how the Government’s cuts to small business taxes will help grow the local economy, grow local businesses and grow local opportunities, including new job opportunities.    “Our plan is all about taking the pressure off small business – the local job creators – so they can get on with running and growing their businesses.”    You can find out more by searching ‘small business’ or visiting www.business.gov.au/smallbusiness.\n\n\n\n--- Page 1 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 2 ---\n\nAEC.0002.0001.5832\n\n\n\n--- Page 1

Follow on ParlWatch. Yesterday, Shadow Attorney-General Mark Dreyfus (Isaacs, Vic, ALP) spoke on political donations, referencing donations by Canstruct executives to the Liberal National Party. The final report of JSCEM’s review of the FAD Reform Act was also presented. The report makes no recommendations, observing that the legislation is working effectively. JSCEM Member James Stevens (Sturt SA, LP) said: “It is clear from the evidence provided to this inquiry that, after an initial transition period, the act in its current form is working appropriately and not hindering the current activities of charitable based organisations. It is very positive that many members of the sector report that their organisations have gained familiarity with the definitions and find them workable. The committee notes there are a variety of conflicting views about possible amendments, but this reflects diverse interest from observers of the political system and is not suggestive of fundamental structural problems.” – StevensHouse of RepresentativesChamber documents:        Votes and Proceedings – Thursday 27 May 2021        Hansard – Thursday 27 May 2021SenateEstimates:Consolidated programAEC appearance: Webcast (from 16:03) | Hansard (Not yet published)JSCEMCurrent inquiries:        Future conduct of elections operating during times of emergency situations Completed inquiries:        Review of the FAD Reform Act – Final report  Jake Farquharson and Bronwen WilliamsonParliamentary Engagement and Party Registration Section | Disclosure, Assurance and Engagement BranchAustralian Electoral CommissionT: (02) 6271 4582 X: 21410 (Jake, A/g Parliamentary Advisor)T: (02) 6271 4705 X: 25007 (Bronwen, A/g Parliamentary Support)\n\n\n--- Page 3 ---\n\nAEC.0002.0001.6805\n\n\n\n--- Page 1 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 2 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 3 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 4 ---\n\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 1 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 2 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 3 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 4 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 5 ---\n\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 1 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 2 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 3 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 4 ---\n\nAEC.0002.0001.6870\n\nCjAEC Australian Electoral Commission • ATTACHMENT A 321D Authorisation of certain electoral matter (1) This section applies in relation to electoral matter that is communicated to a person if: (a) all of the following apply: (i) the matter is an electoral advertisement; (ii) all or part of the distribution or production of the advertisement was paid for; (iii) the content of the advertisement was approved by a person (the notifying entity) (whether or not that person is a person who paid for the distribution or production of the advertisement); or Notifying particulars (5) The notifying entity must.ensure that the particulars set out in the following table, and any other particulars determined under subsection (7) for the purposes of this subsection, are notified in accordance with any requirements determined under that subsection.
