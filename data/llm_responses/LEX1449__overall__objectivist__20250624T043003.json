            "text": "These FOI documents detail the bureaucratic process surrounding the application by \"David Pocock\" to register as a non-Parliamentary political party with the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC). They outline the application, its public advertisement, the four objections received from three individuals (Ernst, Neil, Lis), the party's formal responses to these objections, and the AEC's subsequent determination to approve the registration.\n\nThe objections primarily focused on two points:\n1.  **Citizenship:** The assertion that David Pocock was a foreign citizen at the time of application, rendering him ineligible for the Senate and, by extension, the party ineligible for registration.\n2.  **Party Name:** The argument that \"David Pocock\" as a single person's name cannot constitute a \"party,\" which the objectors define as a \"body of persons united in some sort of cause or opinion.\" They suggested that names like \"David Pocock for the ACT\" or \"David Pocock for the environment\" would be more appropriate.\n\nThe party's response rationally countered these objections, stating that candidate eligibility is separate from party registration and assessed at the time of nomination, not party registration. Regarding the name, the party argued that the Electoral Act has no requirement for a name to be \"consistent with the concept of a party\" or to include specific terms like \"party\" or \"group,\" and that the AEC is not empowered to make such qualitative evaluations.\n\nThe AEC ultimately concluded, based on the explicit provisions of the Electoral Act, that there were no valid grounds to refuse the application, thereby approving the registration.\n\nFrom an Objectivist perspective, several critical points emerge:\n\n**Primacy of Individual Rights and Individual Liberty:**\nWhile the existence of a process to form political parties at all acknowledges a fundamental right to association and political expression, the documents reveal a system that simultaneously curtails it. David Pocock, as an individual, seeks to achieve a political objective through the formation of a party – a prime example of rational self-interest leading to productive achievement (organizing a political movement). However, this individual initiative is immediately subjected to a complex bureaucratic gauntlet, requiring government permission and opening it to public scrutiny and challenge. This system forces individuals to seek the state's imprimatur for voluntary association, infringing upon the liberty to form groups freely and without undue governmental oversight.\n\n**Rational Self-Interest and the Virtue of Productive Achievement:**\nThe applicant, David Pocock, and his team demonstrate rational self-interest by pursuing a political goal. Their methodical response to the objections, meticulously referencing the Electoral Act, exemplifies the use of reason in defending their productive achievement (the formation of the party). The AEC's final decision, based on the letter of the law rather than subjective interpretations, also reflects a commitment to reason within its defined mandate. However, the system imposes a significant burden on this productive achievement by requiring time and resources to navigate bureaucratic hurdles and defend against the subjective whims of objectors.\n\n**Dangers of Collectivism and Government Overreach:**\nThe most glaring violation of Objectivist principles lies in the nature of the objections concerning the party name. The objectors' insistence that \"a single person or the name of a single person cannot constitute a party,\" and their demand that a name \"be consistent with the concept of a party\" or \"indicative of a political party and social cause,\" are direct manifestations of a collectivist mindset. They attempt to impose a preconceived, collective definition of what a \"party\" *should* be, rather than allowing individuals to freely define their own associations and means of identification. This implicitly seeks to subordinate individual initiative and identity to an undefined collective ideal, an affront to individualism.\n\nThe entire registration process, despite the AEC's ultimately rational decision, embodies bureaucratic interference and government overreach.\n*   **Permission-Granting State:** The state, through the AEC, acts as a gatekeeper for political association, requiring formal permission for an entity to operate as a political party. This fundamentally contradicts laissez-faire capitalism, which posits that the government's role is strictly limited to protecting individual rights, not regulating voluntary associations.\n*   **Regulation of Ideas and Identity:** The potential for the government (or objectors influencing it) to dictate what constitutes a \"party\" or how it should be named is a chilling form of thought control and suppression of personal initiative. It creates an environment where individuals must conform to bureaucratic or collective expectations rather than pursuing their unique visions.\n\n**Critique of Forced Altruism, Bureaucratic Interference, or Suppression of Personal Initiative:**\nThe registration process itself is a form of bureaucratic interference that implicitly demands a form of \"forced altruism\" from the applicant. David Pocock is compelled to expend resources, time, and effort to defend his legitimate endeavor against arbitrary and often ill-founded objections from third parties. This diverts his focus from the actual productive work of organizing and articulating his political vision. The public objection period, while superficially appearing transparent, creates an avenue for any individual to lodge an objection, regardless of its merit, thereby imposing an unearned burden on the applicant and consuming state resources. This system stifles personal initiative by making it unnecessarily onerous and fraught with bureaucratic obstacles for new entrants to the political sphere, effectively favoring established entities or those with significant resources to navigate such complexities.\n\nIn summary, while the AEC's final decision to approve the registration demonstrated a commendable adherence to the written law, the overall framework of mandatory party registration, public objections, and bureaucratic review fundamentally violates the principles of individual liberty, laissez-faire capitalism, and the virtue of productive achievement. It exemplifies how even well-intentioned government processes can become instruments of collectivist interference and bureaucratic burden, suppressing the very personal initiative they claim to regulate. A truly free society would allow voluntary associations to form and operate with minimal state intervention, limited only to preventing actual fraud or coercion."

LEX1499 \n\n  Copies of all documents relating to consideration of Applicant’s objection [made in response to the AEC’s advertisement of an application made by \n\nDavid Pocock to register as a non-Parliamentary party in the Register of Political Parties]. \n\nSCHEDULE OF RETRIEVED DOCUMENTS \n\nDoc No. \n\nDescription \n\nDate \n\n  Minute: For action – Final determination of application made under s 126(1)(b) of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 \n\n18 March 2022 \n\n(Electoral Act) for registration as a non-Parliamentary party – David Pocock (the Party)\n\n\n\n--- Page 1 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 2 ---\n\nAEC authorised officer for the purposes of s 132(1) of the Electoral Act, authorised the advertisement \nof the Application in 10 newspapers nationally and on the AEC website (OBJECT ID: A1389361). \n\nOFFICIAL \n\nOn 11 February 2022, the Application was advertised on the AEC website and in 10 major \nnewspapers. A copy of the advertisement is at OBJECT ID: A1354991. The closing date for the \nsubmission of written particulars was 11 March 2022.  \n\nThe AEC received four sets of written particulars (‘objections’) during the public consideration period \nfor the Application, from three persons (‘the Objectors’).  \n\nWritten particulars submitted \n\nWritten particulars \nfrom \n\nDate received \n\nRelevant part of \nthe Electoral Act \n\nOBJECT IDs: \n\n1. \n\n2. \n\n3. \n\n4. \n\n Ernst \n\nErnst \n\n Neil \n\n Lis \n\n10 March 2022 \n\nSs 126 or 129 \n\n10 March 2022 \n\nSs 126 or 129 \n\n10 March 2022 \n\nSs 126 or 129 \n\n10 March 2022 \n\nSs 126 or 129 \n\n– original - A1428572 \n– redacted - A1428570 \n– original - A1431087 \n– redacted - A1431089 \n– original - A1428568 \n– redacted - A1428566 \n– original - A1428574 \n– redacted - A1428564 \n\nLegislative framework – written particulars \nSection 132(2)(b) of the Electoral Act provides that a person can only submit written particulars \nobjecting to an application to register a party (or a logo in the case of s 132(2)(b)(iv) of the Electoral \nAct) if the person believes that:  \n\na)  the application does not relate to an eligible political party; or \nb)  the application is not in accordance with s 126 of the Electoral Act \n(the section setting out the requisite contents of an application); or  \n\nc)  the application should be refused under s 129 of the Electoral Act (the name and \n\nabbreviation tests); or \n\nd)  the Electoral Commission should refuse to enter a logo of the party in the Register under \n\ns 129A of the Electoral Act (the logo test). \n\nFor the Application, written particulars are required to meet the following administrative requirements \nunder ss 132(2)–(3) of the Electoral Act: \n\n1.  be in writing; \n2.  be signed by the objector (either physically, or electronically as per s 10(1) of the Electronic \n\nTransactions Act 1999); \n\n3.  specify a postal address of the objector that does not consist of a post office box number \n(noting the definition of ‘address’ in s 123(1) of the Electoral Act and the postal service \nrequirements in s 140(1) of the Electoral Act); \n\n4.  be submitted within 1 month after the publication of the relevant s 132(1) Notice on the AEC \n\nwebsite; and \n\n5.  set out the objector’s belief that the Application should be refused for a reason listed in \n\ns 132(2)(b) of the Electoral Act and provide grounds in support of that belief. \n\nWritten particulars received objecting to the Application must be processed in accordance with \nss 132(4) and (5) of the Electoral Act. This requires the Electoral Commission to make the written \nparticulars available for public inspection (published on the AEC website) under s 132(4) of the \nElectoral Act, and provide a copy to the Registered Officer for an opportunity to reply under s 132(5) \nof the Electoral Act. \n\nMinute  \n\nPage 2\n\n\n--- Page 3 ---\n\nSummary of Objection one from \n\nErnst\n\nOFFICIAL \n\n‘At the time the application for registration as a political party was lodged it was clear from \ninterviews published in the media including the Canberra Times that Mr David Pocock was a \ncitizen of a foreign country, Zimbabwe, and therefore ineligible for the Senate.’ \n\n‘The AEC should not accept registration of a party named in relation to a person who is \nineligible for the Senate.’ \n\n‘To name a party with the name of a person who at the time of application for registration of \nthe party is ineligible for election is surely inappropriate.’ \n\n‘Election of a number of persons to the Parliament was overturned by the High Court. \nAmongst other things the High Court held the critical issue was eligibility at the time of \nnomination.’ \n\n‘The AEC should reject this registration application. Mr Pocock should be invited to resubmit \nthe application if and when he has become eligible for election to the Senate.’ \n\nSummary of Objection two from  Ernst \n\n‘I submit this proposed name must be rejected because the proposed name is not consistent \nwith the concept of a party. \n\nSimply put, a party is a body of persons united in some sort of cause or opinion or otherwise \nengaged together. \n\nA single person or the name of a single person cannot constitute a party. Accordingly I submit \nthe registration must be rejected. \n\nThis can be compared or contrasted with the proposed registered party logo, David Pocock \nfor the ACT. That represents a cause. So an application to register the name of a party along \nthe lines David Pocock for the ACT may well be valid. So would a name along the lines David \nPocock for the environment. Names along these lines indicate a cause or opinion or some \nsort of engagement beyond a mere name. \n\nThe AEC will appreciate that an invalid registration could have serious consequences. For \nexample if this ‘party’ was registered and placed above the line and the candidate was \nsuccessful another candidate could challenge the validity of the election. \n\nThe AEC should not countenance such obvious uncertainty which can so easily be corrected \nby a fresh application with a name that satisfies the concept of ‘party’.’ \n\nSummary of Objection from \n\n Neil \n\n: \n\n‘I object to acceptance of the proposed party name as simply “David Pocock”.’ \n\n‘Such a title is a person’s name only and not indicative of a political party and social cause. If \nthe applicant wishes only to be referred to by name, as a candidate he can appear in that way \nbelow the line on the ballot paper. If this application is successful. The same words would be \nprinted on the ballot paper above and below the line which would surely be confusing.’ \n\n‘Secondly, if media reports and suggestions are correct in that, at the time of submission of \nthe application for registration of a political party, Mr Pocock was a citizen of another country, \nsurely this renders him in eligible to submit such an application until such time as he has \nsurrendered citizenship of that other country.’ \n\nMinute  \n\nPage 3\n\n\n--- Page 4 ---\n\nSummary of Objection from \n\n Lis \n\n: \n\nOFFICIAL \n\n‘A single person or the name of a single person cannot constitute a party. The reason being: a \nparty is a body of persons united in some sort of cause or opinion or otherwise engaged \ntogether. \n\nThis can be compared or contrasted with the proposed registered party logo, David Pocock \nfor the ACT. That represents a cause. So an application to register the name of a party along \nthe lines David Pocock for the ACT may well be valid. So would a name along the lines David \nPocock for the environment. Names along these lines indicate a cause or opinion or some \nsort of engagement beyond a mere name.’ \n\n‘However, a single name on its own obviously does not constitute a party in accordance with \nthe ordinary meaning of party, hence I submit the registration must be rejected.  \n\n‘The AEC will appreciate that an invalid registration could have serious consequences. If this \n‘party’ was registered and placed above the line and the candidate were to be successful, \nthen another candidate could challenge the validity of the election. \n\nThe AEC should not countenance such obvious uncertainty which can so easily be corrected \nby a fresh application with a name that satisfies the concept of a ‘party.’ \n\nOn 16 March 2022, the Registered Officer of the Party, Mr Glenn Cummings, responded to the \nwritten particulars contained in the objections from ‘Ernst’, ‘Neil’ and ‘Lis’ (OBJECT ID: A1435232 \nand A1435234). The response was published on the AEC website in accordance with s 132(6) of the \nElectoral Act.  \n\nThe response from the Party to each of the objections is outlined below. \n\n‘In summary, our client’s view is that there has been nothing raised in the Objections which, \nunder the Act, would either (i) prevent the Electoral Commissioner from registering the Party \nor (ii) respectfully, permit the Electoral Commissioner to decline to register the Party, as a \nnon-Parliamentary party under Part XI of the Act.).’ \n\nIn relation to Objections from Ernst (2), Neil (3) and Lis (4) the Party responded that: \n\na)  none of the particulars of the Objections refer to a provision of the Act which would prevent \n\nthe registration of the Party with its proposed name;  \n\nb)  there is no requirement in the Act that a name of a party be ‘consistent with the concept of a \n\nparty’;  \n\nc)  the ground invites a qualitative evaluation of what a party should be or how it should operate \nwhich goes far beyond the requirements in the Act and in doing so asks the Commissioner to \nperform a task which it is not empowered by the Act to do;  \n\nd)  in any event, the objects and operation of the Party meet the requirements of the Act as set \nout at 6(a) such that it is entirely consistent with the concept of a party. The name is simply \nthe means by which that party is identified and there is no requirement that the name include \na specific reference to it being a ‘party’, ‘group’ or some other ‘cause based entity’ as is \nargued in the Objections. \n\nIn relation to the second Objection from Ernst the Party responded that: \n\na)  it is a speculative allegation that the outcome of the election could be challenged on the basis \nthat the Party is placed above the line and the Objections are silent as to which provision of \nthe Act could properly found such a challenge or declaration of invalidity under s 362 of the \nAct; \n\nMinute  \n\nPage 4\n\n\n--- Page 5 ---\n\nb)   again, it invites a qualitative evaluation of the effect of the name of a party, where that name \n\ndoes not contain any of the prohibited features in s 129 of the Act. \n\nOFFICIAL \n\nIn relation to Objections from Ernst (1) and Neil (3) (the Section 44 reference) the Party responded \nthat: \n\na)  the question of eligibility of a proposed endorsed candidate of a party for election is separate \n\nto the eligibility of a party to be registered as a non-Parliamentary Party; \n\nb)  the Party meets the requirements for registration as a non-Parliamentary Party and the \n\neligibility of any proposed endorsed candidates is not permitted by the Act to be undertaken in \nthe assessment of a party registration application; \n\nc)  even if it were relevant to consider the eligibility for election of a proposed candidate, the point \nat which a candidate must be eligible is the point at which they nominate for election, not the \npoint at which the party is registered. \n\n‘Based on the above, the Party submits that the Electoral Commissioner should reject the \nparticulars in the Objections and not decline to register the Party on the basis of such \nparticulars.’ \n\nConsideration of the Objections and the Response \n\nUnder ss 132A(1) and 133(3) of the Electoral Act, if the Electoral Commission refuses an application \nfor registration, the Electoral Commission must: \n\n•  publicise the reasons for the Electoral Commission’s decision; and  \n•  give written notice of those reasons to the applicant(s); and \n•  give written notice of those reasons to any person who submitted an objection under s 132(2) \n\nin relation to the application. \n\nUnder ss 133(1) and 133(1A) of the Electoral Act, if the Electoral Commission makes a determination \nthat a political party should be registered, the Electoral Commissioner must:  \n\n•  publish notice of the registration on the AEC website (and may publish the notice in any other \n\nway that the Electoral Commissioner considers appropriate); \n•  give written notice of the registration to the applicant(s); and \n•  give written notice to any person who submitted an objection under s 132(2) in relation to the \n\napplication, setting out the reasons for rejecting the person’s reasons for making their \nobjection. \n\nYou are a delegate of the Electoral Commission for the purposes of ss 132A(1), 133(1) and 133(3), \nand you are authorised to publish notice of registration under s 133(1A) of the Electoral Act. \nA copy of a draft statement of reasons (‘the Draft Statement of Reasons’) is at OBJECT ID: \nA1389673 and has been drafted on the recommendation that you make the determination that the \nParty should be registered. \n\nAlthough it would not be a legal requirement for you to publicise or provide reasons to the Applicants \nif you make the determination that the Party should be registered (as opposed to if you decide to \nrefuse the Application), the Draft Statement of Reasons has been drafted in the interests of \ntransparency and consistency.  \n\nConclusion \n\nOn 24 December 2021, the AEC received all of the procedural requirements for an application for \nregistration from the Applicants under ss 126(1)(b) and 126(2) of the Electoral Act. \n\nMinute  \n\nPage 5\n\n\n--- Page 6 ---\n\nOFFICIAL \n\nOn 4 February 2022, a delegate for the purposes of s 131 of the Electoral Act of the Electoral \nCommission determined that the Application passed the initial assessment. The delegate (also an \nauthorised officer for the purposes of s 132(1) of the Electoral Act) approved the advertisement of the \nApplication in 10 newspapers circulating generally in each State and Territory and on the AEC \nwebsite. The Application was advertised on 11 February 2022 and four sets of written particulars \nfrom three objectors, were received during the public consultation period by the closing date of 11 \nMarch 2022. \n\nAfter considering the objections and response from the Party, the AEC found there are no additional \ngrounds or information provided to give reason for the delegate to refuse the application for \nregistration.  \n\nBased on this information, there is no basis to refuse the Application and the Application should be \napproved for registration. Under s 126(3) of the Electoral Act you, as a delegate of the Electoral \nCommission, have the authority to approve the Application. \n\nMinute  \n\nPage 6\n\n\n--- Page 7 ---\n\n\n\nProvide only the markdown formatted summary text.
