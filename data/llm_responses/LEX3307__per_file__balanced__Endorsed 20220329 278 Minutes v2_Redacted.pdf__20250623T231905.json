The Commission examined the application for review and affirmed the deregistration, concluding that the party failed to meet the requirement of having at least 1,500 members under s 137(6) of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918. The Commission upheld the delegate's decision of November 3, 2021, pursuant to section 141(4) of the Act.\n\n### Relevance to FOI Request\n\nThis document is highly relevant to the FOI request for minutes pertaining to electoral process integrity between March 1 and September 19, 2022. Specifically, it directly addresses the requester's interest in the \"party register\" and \"membership testing.\" The meeting's focus on reviewing and affirming a party's deregistration due to insufficient membership numbers demonstrates the AEC's active role in maintaining the integrity and accuracy of the official party register, which includes processes for verifying party membership criteria."
