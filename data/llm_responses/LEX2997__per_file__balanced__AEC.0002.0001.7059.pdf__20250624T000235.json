It details a roundtable event hosted by Dr. Laming in Cleveland with Minister McCormack and local business leaders, promoting government policies aimed at supporting small businesses, such as tax cuts, the instant asset write-off, and trade agreements.\n\nIts relevance to the FOI request lies in providing an example of the political content and messaging Dr. Laming disseminated publicly. The FOI request specifically investigates allegations that Dr. Laming used numerous Facebook pages disguised as community or news groups to promote political content—including potentially content derived from or similar to this media release—without mandatory electoral authorisation disclosures. While this document itself is a formal, clearly attributed media release, it illustrates the type of material that, if posted on Laming's alleged 'disguised' Facebook pages without proper authorisation, would fall under the scope of the AEC's investigation into compliance with federal electoral laws."

Do not include any conversational filler or preamble.To aid you, the overview of the FOI request is: [REQUEST OVERVIEW START] The FOI request disclosed documents detailing the Australian Electoral Commission's (AEC) investigation into Andrew Laming MP's Facebook pages for compliance with federal electoral authorisation laws. This inquiry was triggered by public complaints and media reports, notably from *The Guardian*, alleging Laming used numerous pages (e.g., \"Redland Bay Bulletin,\" \"Redlands Institute\") disguised as community or news groups to promote political content and attack opponents without mandatory disclosures. The AEC confirmed an active investigation, noting 2018 Electoral Act amendments broadened social media authorisation, and issued formal notices to Laming for detailed information and to third parties (like Facebook) for data, with Facebook confirming its cooperation. Findings revealed some pages were removed or updated with authorisation, while others remained active and unauthorised.\n [REQUEST OVERVIEW END] \n\n--- MAIN DOCUMENT TEXT START ---\n\n\n\n--- Page 1 ---\n\nAEC.0002.0001.7059\n\n The Hon. Michael McCormack MP Minister for Small Business Federal Member for Riverina  Dr Andrew Laming MP Federal Member for Bowman  MEDIA RELEASE ENDS  Media Contacts:  McCormack – Dom Hopkinson 0428 373 122 Laming – Penny Donald – 0410 556 760 13 April 2017  BOON FOR BOWMAN’S SMALL BUSINESSES   FEDERAL Member for Bowman Andrew Laming hosted Minister for Small Business Michael McCormack in Cleveland today holding a roundtable with local small businesspeople and community leaders.   “I am pleased the Minister accepted my invitation to visit Bowman and to meet local businesspeople to discuss how the Government’s small business plan will help them grow and create local jobs,” Dr Laming said.   “Today, we discussed cuts to small business taxes and the instant asset write off programme which the Government has delivered to free-up resources for small businesses to reinvest and grow.   “We also discussed new trade opportunities and export markets small businesses can tap into following the Government’s successful negotiation of trade agreements with South Korea, Japan and China.   “Small businesspeople were also interested to hear about the Government’s changes to competition policy and new laws we have introduced to ensure multinationals pay their fair share of tax – all of which are levelling the playing field for small businesses to compete on their merits.”  Minister McCormack said the Government’s small business plan was a centre-piece for economic growth and job creation.   “The Government’s small business plan is focused on driving economic growth in local communities and in the national economy,” Mr McCormack said.   “Small businesses employ more than five and a half million Australians and contribute more than $380 billion in GDP every year, making it a vital sector in our economy.   “It is great to be here today with Andrew Laming to discuss how the Government’s cuts to small business taxes will help grow the local economy, grow local businesses and grow local opportunities, including new job opportunities.    “Our plan is all about taking the pressure off small business – the local job creators – so they can get on with running and growing their businesses.”    You can find out more by searching ‘small business’ or visiting www.business.gov.au/smallbusiness.\n\n"
