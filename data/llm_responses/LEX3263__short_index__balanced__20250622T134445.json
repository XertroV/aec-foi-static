Released documents provided this quantitative data and a DFAT minute, revealing Wellington had 0 in-person votes in 2022 (resulting in a significant increase in its postal votes), while Auckland continued in-person voting but also saw a substantial rise in postal votes. Direct AEC postal returns from NZ significantly decreased in 2022. The DFAT minute confirmed the Wellington decision stemmed from a redacted risk analysis and recommendations for overseas voting."

This aligns with the data showing zero in-person votes cast at Wellington in 2022.\n\nProvide only the markdown formatted summary text. Do not include any conversational filler or preamble."
