            "text": "### Document Summary\n\nThis document, identified as \"ATTACHMENT A,\" details specific sections of the Australian Electoral Act 1918 relevant to electoral authorisation and compliance.\n\n*   **Section 321D – Authorisation of certain electoral matter:** This section outlines requirements for authorising electoral communications, including paid advertisements. It specifies the \"notifying particulars\" that must be disclosed, which vary based on the type of communication (e.g., stickers vs. other communications) and the authorising entity (e.g., natural person, disclosure entity, or other entity). Required particulars generally include the name and relevant town/city or address of the entity/person responsible for authorisation, and for some materials, the printer's details. Non-compliance is a civil penalty provision.\n*   **Section 321F – Electoral Commissioner may obtain information and documents from persons:** This section empowers the Electoral Commissioner to issue written notices requiring individuals or entities to provide information, documents, or copies thereof, if the Commissioner has reason to believe such material is relevant to assessing compliance with Section 321D. The Commissioner must consider the costs incurred by the person in complying, and notices must inform recipients about penalties for false or misleading information.\n\n### Relevance to the FOI Request\n\nThis document provides the core legal framework for the Australian Electoral Commission's (AEC) investigation into Andrew Laming MP's Facebook pages, as described in the FOI request.\n\n*   **Legal Basis for Authorisation Laws:** Section 321D directly defines the federal electoral authorisation laws that Laming's Facebook pages were investigated for potentially violating. It clarifies the mandatory disclosure requirements for political content disseminated through various communication channels, which is central to the allegations of pages operating without proper authorisation.\n*   **AEC's Investigative Powers:** Section 321F provides the explicit legal authority for the AEC to issue formal notices to Andrew Laming MP for detailed information and to third parties like Facebook for data, as stated in the FOI request. This section underpins the AEC's ability to compel information during its investigation into compliance with authorisation requirements."

Do not include any conversational filler or preamble.To aid you, the overview of the FOI request is: [REQUEST OVERVIEW START] The FOI request disclosed documents detailing the Australian Electoral Commission's (AEC) investigation into Andrew Laming MP's Facebook pages for compliance with federal electoral authorisation laws. This inquiry was triggered by public complaints and media reports, notably from *The Guardian*, alleging Laming used numerous pages (e.g., \"Redland Bay Bulletin,\" \"Redlands Institute\") disguised as community or news groups to promote political content and attack opponents without mandatory disclosures. The AEC confirmed an active investigation, noting 2018 Electoral Act amendments broadened social media authorisation, and issued formal notices to Laming for detailed information and to third parties (like Facebook) for data, with Facebook confirming its cooperation. Findings revealed some pages were removed or updated with authorisation, while others remained active and unauthorised.\n [REQUEST OVERVIEW END] \n\n--- MAIN DOCUMENT TEXT START ---\n\n\n\n--- Page 1 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 2 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 3 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 4 ---\n\nAEC.0002.0001.6925\n\nc:)AEC Australian Electoral Commission • ATTACHMENT A 321D Authorisation of certain electoral matter (1) This section applies in relation to electoral matter that is communicated to a person if: (a) all of the following apply: (i) the matter is an electoral advertisement; (ii) all or part of the distribution or production of the advertisement was paid for; (iii) the content of the advertisement was approved by a person (the notifying entity) (whether or not that person is a person who paid for the distribution or production of the advertisement); or Notifying particulars (5) The notifying entity must ensure that the particulars set out in the following table, and any other particulars determined under subsection (7) for the purposes of this subsection, are notified in accordance with any requirements determined under that subsection.
