These documents primarily detail the Commission's decisions and discussions concerning political party registration, deregistration, and name changes, alongside the evolving methodology for verifying party membership, particularly in response to legislative amendments increasing the minimum member requirement from 500 to 1,500. Key discussions included seeking Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) advice on membership testing, and specific rulings on party names (e.g., \"The New Liberals,\" \"Liberal Democratic Party\"), deregistration (e.g., \"Australian People’s Party,\" \"VOTEFLUX.ORG\"), and re-registration (e.g., \"Seniors United Party of Australia\")."

Main Purpose of the FOI Request\n\nThe FOI request sought \"the minutes of all meetings of The Commission that took place between March 2nd 2021 and October 19th 2022.\" This period spans approximately 596 days.\n\n### 2. Documents Released\n\nThe FOI request resulted in the release of seven sets of endorsed meeting minutes, all provided as edited copies with exemptions applied (primarily Section 47F, and also 42, 47C):\n\n*   Endorsed minutes for Commission Meeting No. 272, held on 18 March 2021\n*   Endorsed minutes for Commission Meeting No. 273, held on 3 September 2021\n*   Endorsed minutes for Commission Meeting No. 274, held on 6 October 2021\n*   Endorsed minutes for Commission Meeting No. 276, held on 17 November 2021\n*   Endorsed minutes for Commission Meeting No. 277, held on 8 February 2022\n*   Endorsed minutes for Commission Meeting No. 278, held on 29 March 2022\n*   Endorsed minutes for Commission Meeting No. 279, held on 26 September 2022\n\n### 3. Main Content from the Released Documents\n\nThe minutes primarily detail decisions and discussions related to political party registration, deregistration, name changes, and the methodology for verifying party membership, particularly in light of legislative amendments.\n\n*   **Commission Meeting No. 272 (18 March 2021):**\n    *   Discussed the AEC's party registration and membership testing process, which uses statistical sampling for non-parliamentary parties requiring 500 members.\n    *   Agreed to engage the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) for updated advice on the current membership testing methodology and to explore alternatives to increase statistical confidence without over-resourcing the AEC.\n    *   Affirmed the delegate's decision to refuse registration of the \"Stop Selling Australia Party\" due to insufficient members.\n\n*   **Commission Meeting No. 273 (3 September 2021):**\n    *   Received an update on amendments to the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 (the Electoral Act) requiring changes to the membership testing methodology due to an increase in the minimum number of members for non-parliamentary parties (from 500 to 1,500).\n    *   Decided to investigate using an external government department for membership testing.\n    *   Discussed ongoing applications for review, specifically for \"Small Business Party\" and \"The Seniors United Party of Australia\" deregistration, and decided to inform them of the impending legislative changes to membership numbers.\n    *   Discussed \"The New Liberals\" registration, noting an objection based on name similarity and membership issues.\n\n*   **Commission Meeting No. 274 (6 October 2021):**\n    *   Endorsed an updated membership testing methodology, based on ABS advice, for the new requirement of 1,500 members, requesting recalibration of parameters for accuracy.\n    *   Agreed to formally notify all registered non-Parliamentary parties under s 138A of the Electoral Act to provide information establishing they meet the 1,500-member eligibility requirement as of 2 December 2021.\n\n*   **Commission Meeting No. 276 (17 November 2021):**\n    *   **Seniors United Party of Australia:** Set aside the delegate's decision to deregister the party and decided to re-register it after assessing a revised membership list.\n    *   **The New Liberals:** Set aside the delegate's decision to register the party. The Commission refused registration because the name \"The New Liberals\" was deemed too similar to \"Liberal Party of Australia\" or \"Liberal,\" likely to cause confusion (s 129(1)(d) of the Electoral Act). The party was subsequently removed from the Register.\n\n*   **Commission Meeting No. 277 (8 February 2022):**\n    *   **Liberal Democratic Party:** Affirmed the delegate's decision to uphold an objection to the continued use of the name 'Liberal Democratic Party' and the abbreviation 'Liberal Democrats'.\n    *   **Democratic Labour Party:** Granted an extension for a review request, then affirmed the delegate's decision to uphold an objection to the continued use of the name 'Democratic Labour Party' and the abbreviation 'Labour DLP'.\n    *   **United Australia Party:** Affirmed the delegate's decision to allow Clive Palmer’s United Australia Party to change its name and abbreviation to 'United Australia Party' and 'UAP' respectively.\n\n*   **Commission Meeting No. 278 (29 March 2022):**\n    *   **Australian People’s Party:** Affirmed the delegate's decision to deregister the party, confirming it did not meet the requirement of at least 1,500 members.\n\n*   **Commission Meeting No. 279 (26 September 2022):**\n    *   **VOTEFLUX.ORG | Upgrade Democracy!:** Affirmed the delegate's decision to deregister the party.\n    *   **Australian Federation Party:** Affirmed the delegate's decision to approve the party's application to change its logo on the Register of Political Parties.\n\nProvide only the markdown formatted summary text. Do not include any conversational filler or preamble."
