The AEC explains that as the recipient was a candidate in the 2016 federal election (making them a \"disclosure entity\") and some posts are sponsored advertisements, all electoral matter they communicate must include authorisation under sections 321D(1) and (5) of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918. The email defines 'electoral matter' and specifies that authorisations must include the name of the person who approved/communicated the content and their town/city. The AEC requests the recipient add the authorisations by 1 May 2019, cautioning about potential penalties up to $25,200 and the possibility of injunctions for non-compliance.\n\nThis document is highly relevant to FOI Request LEX3047 as it directly aligns with the request's scope for AEC documents concerning complaints in April-May 2019 about electoral advertisements lacking authorisation. It exemplifies the AEC's process for handling such complaints, demonstrating their consistent approach of: clarifying 'electoral matter' and authorisation requirements, advising on compliance obligations for 'disclosure entities' (like past candidates), requesting subjects to add necessary authorisations, and warning of potential penalties for non-compliance. This case specifically involves digital platforms (Facebook pages) and addresses the absence of required authorisation details, directly reflecting the core themes of the FOI request."

Do not include any conversational filler or preamble.To aid you, the overview of the FOI request is: [REQUEST OVERVIEW START] FOI Request LEX3047 obtained Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) documents concerning complaints made primarily in April and May 2019 about electoral advertisements lacking authorisation or being misleading. The released materials include public email complaints and the AEC's responses to various entities like \"Our Vote Our Community\" and \"Bass Deserves Better\" Facebook pages, \"RiteOn!\" website, and other media. The complaints predominantly highlighted the absence of required authorisation details on political advertising across digital and print platforms, with some also raising concerns about misleading \"community group\" portrayals or unauthorised paid ads. In response, the AEC consistently clarified 'electoral matter' and authorisation requirements under the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918, requested subjects to add necessary authorisations, cease distribution of non-compliant materials, and advised on potential penalties up to $25,200 for non-compliance, as well as obligations for \"disclosure entities.\"\n [REQUEST OVERVIEW END] \n\n--- MAIN DOCUMENT TEXT START ---\n\n\n\n--- Page 1 ---\n\nFrom:\nSent:\nTo:\nSubject:\n\nDear \n\nAuthorisation Section\nFriday, 26 April 2019 1:55 PM\n\nAuthorisation of electoral communications [SEC=UNCLASSIFIED]\n\nI am writing to you on behalf of the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC). \n\nThe AEC has received a complaint that the \n& Architect to the Very Rich & Worthy’ Facebook pages do not include an authorisation as required by the \nCommonwealth Electoral Act 1918 (Electoral Act). \n\n for WILLS’ and \n\n Thinker Politician \n\nCertain communications of electoral matter are required to include an authorisation under the Electoral Act so that \nvoters know who is communicating electoral matter to them. \n\nThe definition of ‘electoral matter’ in the Electoral Act means: \n\nmatter communicated or intended to be communicated for the dominant purpose of influencing the way \nelectors vote in an election (a federal election) of a member of the House of Representatives or of Senators \nfor a State or Territory, including by promoting or opposing: \n\n(a) a political entity, to the extent that the matter relates to a federal election; or \n(b) a member of the House of Representatives or a Senator. \n\nCommunications of electoral matter where all or part of the distribution or production of an electoral advertisement \nwas paid for, or the electoral matter is communicated by, or on behalf of, a disclosure entity, is required to include \nan authorisation. These obligations are contained in sections 321D(1) and (5) of the Electoral Act. The definition of \n‘disclosure entity’ includes, amongst others, a senator or member of the House of Representatives, a person who is \na candidate in an election or by-election, or a person who was a candidate in an election or by-election of a member \nof the House of Representatives in the previous 4 years, or an election of Senators for a State or Territory in the \nprevious 7 years.  \n\nWe note that you stood as a candidate in the division of Wills in the 2016 federal election and as such, all \ncommunications of electoral matter by, or on behalf of, yourself are required by the Electoral Act to include an \nauthorisation. We also note that some of your posts are currently being sponsored as advertisements which also \nrequire an authorisation. \n\nRelevantly for websites and social media, the authorisation must include: \n\n(a) the name of the person who either approved the content of the electoral matter before it was \n\ncommunicated, or otherwise the person that communicated the electoral matter; and \n\n(b) the relevant town or city of the person. \n\nMore information on the authorisation requirements is in the Electoral Backgrounder on the AEC website. If you \nrequire clarification, the AEC recommends you seek independent legal advice. \n\nCan you please address these omissions by adding the required authorisation to the ‘About’ section of the \n\n Thinker Politician & Architect to the Very Rich & Worthy’ \nFacebook pages by COB this Wednesday 1 May 2019 and send a reply email to authorisationsection@aec.gov.au \nonce this is done? \n\n for WILLS’ and \n\n1\n\n47F47F47F47F47F47F\n\n\n--- Page 2 ---\n\nFailure to authorise electoral communications where required can result in a penalty of up to $25,200. One further \npoint to note on the authorisation of electoral matter; whilst the Electoral Act enables the AEC to seek an injunction \nagainst an electoral communication that does not meet the requirements in the Electoral Act, now that the federal \nelection has been called, the Electoral Act enables other persons who have been nominated as candidates to also \nseek an injunction against any unauthorised electoral communications. \n\nYours sincerely \n\n | Senior Lawyer  \n\nElectoral Authorisation Section | Legal & Procurement Branch \nAustralian Electoral Commission \nT: \n\n2\n\n47F47F\n\n"
