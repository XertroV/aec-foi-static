Do not include any conversational filler or preamble.To aid you, the overview of the FOI request is: [REQUEST OVERVIEW START] This FOI request (LEX3177) sought documents supporting the Australian Electoral Commission's (AEC) conclusion that its membership testing methodology was \"rational, fair and practical.\" The primary released document, the \"Commission Paper – Review of the delegate’s decision to deregister the Senior United Party of Australia\" (17 Nov 2021), details the AEC's methodology, developed by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) and re-endorsed in 2017, as the foundation for its appropriateness. The paper outlines three membership testing rounds for the Seniors United Party of Australia (SUPA), with initial tests in October 2020 and February 2021 failing to meet the 500-member threshold, leading to deregistration. However, a September 2021 test, conducted during an internal review, successfully verified SUPA's membership, leading to the party's re-registration. The paper also systematically addresses SUPA's claims of unfairness (e.g., due to demographics, alleged errors, lack of scrutineers), asserting the methodology's consistent application, impartiality, and focus on formal membership, thus demonstrating its adherence to the principles of rationality, fairness, and practicality.\n [REQUEST OVERVIEW END] \n\n--- MAIN DOCUMENT TEXT START ---\n\n\n\n--- Page 1 ---\n\nRequest for: \n\nFOI REQUEST NO.
