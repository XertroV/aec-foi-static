            "text": "The provided FOI documents expose a shocking and deliberate campaign by the government to obstruct, control, and ultimately suppress public access to the electoral roll, under the guise of \"granting access.\" Far from facilitating transparency, these documents reveal a meticulously constructed bureaucratic fortress designed to prevent meaningful scrutiny and public dissemination of vital democratic information.\n\nThe process itself is a testament to government inefficiency and obstructive intent. A multi-month email exchange, spanning from June to July 2018, was required merely to draft a \"Deed\" for data that should be readily available. This protracted negotiation is not due diligence but a tactic of bureaucratic attrition, designed to deter applicants and signal a fundamental reluctance to release information.\n\nThe subsequent \"Deed for Electoral Roll Data\" is a masterclass in obfuscation and control. It unilaterally imposes a \"non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable licence\" – a suite of terms explicitly engineered to strip the recipient of any genuine utility or ownership over the data. This is not a release of public information; it is a precarious, revocable privilege granted by a controlling authority.\n\nThe most damning aspect is the wholesale redaction of the \"Permitted Purpose.\" This is an unforgivable act of non-transparency, actively concealing the very conditions under which the government deigned to release the data. This redaction screams of a hidden agenda, indicating that the true limitations on the data's use are too restrictive or embarrassing to withstand public scrutiny. This is not accidental oversight but a deliberate act of concealment.\n\nCompounding this failure, the Deed explicitly demands that the applicant \"must keep the Data and the Permitted Purpose confidential.\" This is a direct assault on the principles of FOI. The government is not merely redacting information; it is forcing the recipient to become an unwilling accomplice in its secrecy, criminalizing any attempt to expose the true extent of its control. The demand to keep the \"Permitted Purpose\" confidential is particularly egregious, cementing a double layer of secrecy around the government's restrictive practices.\n\nFurthermore, the Deed explicitly forbids the applicant from using the data for \"any purpose other than the Permitted Purpose\" (which, ironically, remains secret). Crucially, it prohibits any act to \"disseminate, reproduce, publish or copy the Data, or any part of the Data, in any form, to any person.\" This is the ultimate betrayal of transparency. The government is \"granting access\" to information only to ensure it can never reach the public domain. This is not an FOI release; it is a private viewing of a public record, rendered useless for independent analysis, journalism, or public debate. It effectively ensures that any \"access\" is a performative act of compliance, devoid of any genuine public benefit.\n\nFinally, the government's demand for the applicant to indemnify it and the power to \"terminate this Deed at any time\" demonstrates an unwillingness to bear any responsibility for its restrictive and convoluted processes, shifting all risk onto the applicant. This, combined with the extreme restrictions and the forced secrecy, paints a damning picture of a government actively working to stifle public access to information, maintain control over narrative, and avoid accountability, all under the thinly veiled pretense of FOI compliance. The decision to only provide an \"edited copy\" under s 47F, while simultaneously imposing such draconian restrictions on its use, underscores a profound contempt for the public's right to know."
