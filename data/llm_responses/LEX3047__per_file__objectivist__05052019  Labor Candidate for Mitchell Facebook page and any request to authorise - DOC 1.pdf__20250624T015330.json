This system, which mandates identity disclosure for political speech and imposes burdensome compliance and penalties, flagrantly abrogates the inalienable right to free expression—including the freedom to speak anonymously—subordinating individual liberty to a collectivist \"right to know.\" Such bureaucratic overreach burdens individuals engaged in the rational pursuit of shaping the political landscape, chilling free discourse, stifling personal initiative, and creating an environment where exercising fundamental rights carries prohibitive costs. This government interference distorts the natural marketplace of ideas, favors established entities over independent citizens, and exemplifies the dangers of collectivism antithetical to a truly laissez-faire society where ideas should compete on their merits, unmolested by state control or censorship.\n [REQUEST OVERVIEW END] \n\n--- MAIN DOCUMENT TEXT START ---\n\n\n\n--- Page 1 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 2 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 3 ---\n\n3\n\n22\n\nProvide only the markdown formatted summary text.
