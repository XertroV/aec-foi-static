The email from \"Evan\" in the media team states the response confirms the AEC's active investigation and details minor aspects of electoral law application. It anticipates a follow-up article from *The Guardian* with the AEC investigation as a lead. The email also notes public sentiment on Twitter, which expresses skepticism regarding the AEC's ability or willingness to act. Electoral Commissioner Tom Rogers emphasizes the need to \"move pretty smartly\" with the matter.\n\nThis document is highly relevant to the FOI request as it:\n*   **Confirms AEC's Investigation:** Explicitly states the AEC's investigation into Laming's Facebook pages is active and has been communicated to media outlets like *The Guardian*, aligning with the FOI overview that media reports triggered the inquiry and the AEC confirmed an active investigation.\n*   **Demonstrates Media Engagement:** Shows direct communication between the AEC and *The Guardian* regarding the ongoing inquiry, substantiating the FOI request's context of public complaints and media reports driving the investigation.\n*   **Highlights Public Scrutiny:** Reveals the AEC's awareness of public and social media perception (Twitter activity) surrounding its handling of the Laming matter, underscoring the high-profile nature of the investigation."

  "prompt": "Considering this document as part of an FOI request, summarize the document and its relevance to the FOI request in markdown format. Provide only the markdown formatted summary text. Do not include any conversational filler or preamble.To aid you, the overview of the FOI request is: [REQUEST OVERVIEW START] The FOI request disclosed documents detailing the Australian Electoral Commission's (AEC) investigation into Andrew Laming MP's Facebook pages for compliance with federal electoral authorisation laws. This inquiry was triggered by public complaints and media reports, notably from *The Guardian*, alleging Laming used numerous pages (e.g., \"Redland Bay Bulletin,\" \"Redlands Institute\") disguised as community or news groups to promote political content and attack opponents without mandatory disclosures. The AEC confirmed an active investigation, noting 2018 Electoral Act amendments broadened social media authorisation, and issued formal notices to Laming for detailed information and to third parties (like Facebook) for data, with Facebook confirming its cooperation. Findings revealed some pages were removed or updated with authorisation, while others remained active and unauthorised.\n [REQUEST OVERVIEW END] \n\n--- MAIN DOCUMENT TEXT START ---\n\n\n\n--- Page 1 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 2 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 3 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 4 ---\n\nAEC.0002.0001.1202\n\nFrom: Tom Rogers <Tom.Rogers@aec.gov.au> Sent: Wednesday, 7 April 2021 11:27 AMTo: media <media@aec.gov.au>; Executive Leadership Team <ExecutiveLeadershipTeam@aec.gov.au>Subject: RE: Guardian response re Laming FB authorisation [SEC=OFFICIAL] Thanks, Evan – we’ll need to make sure we move pretty smartly with this.

The response simply confirms our investigation of the matter and otherwise provides minor extraneous details re application of the law. Receipt has been acknowledged & we can expect a follow-up article very soon with AEC investigation as a lead.  Twitter activityThere is a reasonable level of Twitter activity on the matter off the back of tweets like the ones below. The general response in relation to the AEC – from members of the public - is a mixture of “don’t expect AEC to do anything”, “the AEC is biased so won’t take action” and “they don’t have any power to take action”.  As is standard on the channel – purple signs have been raised a number of times.  We will monitor Twitter traffic and provide some select responses – based on the below enquiry response.   CheersEvan\n\n\n--- Page 5 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 6 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 7 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 8 ---\n\nAEC.0002.0001.1206\n\n"
