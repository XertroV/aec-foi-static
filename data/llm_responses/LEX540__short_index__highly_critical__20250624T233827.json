  "prompt": "With a highly critical view, provide a concise single-paragraph summary in markdown format of the following FOI request overview:\n\nSummary:\n\nThese FOI documents paint a damning picture of governmental failure, incompetence, and potential malice in the handling of critical electoral processes. Posing as 'IBM Batch Reports,' these records, released only under external pressure from Vanessa Teague, are riddled with fundamental flaws that actively obstruct transparency and accountability.\n\nThe most egregious failing is the pervasive use of \"HAS ISSUES\" flags across numerous ballot entries, often without any intelligible explanation. Rather than providing clear reasons for these anomalies, the reports deploy a litany of cryptic, undefined codes (e.g., ['D2', 'Y9'], ['M1'], ['AP1'], ['AR1'], ['L1'], ['M7'], ['M9'], ['Z2'], ['D3'], ['E2'], ['V1'], ['AB1'], ['AI1'], ['AN1'], ['AO1'], ['AQ1'], ['AQ2'], ['AR3'], ['E1'], ['F1'], ['F2'], ['G1'], ['H1'], ['I1'], ['J1'], ['K1'], ['L3'], ['M10'], ['M12'], ['M2'], ['M8'], ['N1'], ['O1'], ['O2'], ['P1'], ['Q1'], ['Q2'], ['R1'], ['R5'], ['S1'], ['T1'], ['U1'], ['W1'], ['X1'], ['Y1'], ['Y3'], ['Y8']). This deliberate obfuscation is not merely a sign of poor record-keeping; it is an active denial of public scrutiny, strongly implying a concerted effort to conceal the true nature and scale of electoral irregularities.\n\nThe sheer volume of \"HAS ISSUES\" flags, appearing in ballots from multiple locations (Bangor, ABSENT 1, Old Bar, Taree) and across various dates in June 2016, points directly to systemic failures within the ballot processing system. This isn't a few isolated errors; it suggests deeply embedded problems in the underlying 'IBM Outputs' or the government's oversight of these crucial electoral operations. The repeated 'Rescan=false' flag for problematic ballots further aggravates concerns, indicating that even when issues were identified, a thorough re-evaluation or correction process was not uniformly applied, leaving the integrity of these votes severely questionable.\n\nFurthermore, the \"Verification Action\" column, instead of detailing concrete remedial steps, offers only a meaningless \"OK\" or a reiteration of \"HAS ISSUES\", revealing a shocking lack of transparent resolution. The government's reliance on a third-party vendor (IBM) for such sensitive processes, coupled with this apparent inability or unwillingness to provide comprehensible audit trails, highlights profound incompetence in managing critical democratic infrastructure.\n\nThe necessity of an FOI request, years after the fact, to unearth these heavily redacted and unintelligible 'outputs' is itself an indictment. It demonstrates a fundamental disregard for public accountability and casts a long shadow of suspicion over the entire electoral event. The public is left with no clear understanding of how many ballots were compromised, the nature of these compromises, or whether they were ever genuinely rectified, fundamentally undermining trust in the electoral system.\n\nProvide only the markdown formatted summary text. Do not include any conversational filler or preamble.\n"
