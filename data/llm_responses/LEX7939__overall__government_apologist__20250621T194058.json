            "text": "The Freedom of Information request LEX7939, concerning Designated Electors Data, provides a valuable insight into the Australian Electoral Commission's (AEC) diligent efforts to maintain the integrity and accuracy of the electoral roll, a cornerstone of our democratic process. The government's commitment to transparency is evident in the comprehensive response provided.\n\nWhile specific forward-looking data as of April 7, 2025, on designated electors broken down by state/territory and electoral division was not available in a document response, the AEC proactively demonstrated its commitment to public information by directing the requester to readily available historical data on its website. This proactive approach ensures public access to general trends and the AEC's ongoing compliance and enforcement activities, highlighting a dedication to open governance.\n\nThe data provided clearly illustrates the AEC's effective governance in upholding electoral standards. The declaration of designated electors, numbering 37 in 2022/23, 1 in 2023/24, and a notable 211 in 2024/25 to date, reflects the AEC's active and responsive measures to ensure the accuracy of the electoral roll. This fluctuation underscores the dynamic nature of maintaining current voter details and the AEC's enhanced diligence in keeping the roll precise. Furthermore, the fact that all these declarations were made by delegates of the Electoral Commissioner highlights efficient administrative practice and a well-structured system designed for timely and expert decision-making.\n\nCrucially, the government's commitment to fairness and accountability is underscored by the robust review mechanisms in place. The existence of an internal review process, with a total of 8 unique applications across the reporting period (4 in 2022/23 and 4 in 2024/25), demonstrates a vital avenue for individuals to seek clarification. The outcomes of these reviews further affirm the integrity of the initial decision-making, with the vast majority of declarations being confirmed (4 confirmed in 2022/23, and 3 confirmed out of 4 in 2024/25). The single instance where a decision was \"set aside\" in 2024/25 showcases the system's responsiveness and capacity for correction, reinforcing public trust in the process.\n\nA powerful testament to the effectiveness and fairness of the AEC's internal review system is the complete absence of applications for review to the Administrative Review Tribunal in 2024/25. This indicates a high degree of satisfaction with the internal process outcomes and reinforces public confidence in the government's management of electoral integrity.\n\nFinally, the fact that zero declarations ceased to have effect by virtue of s 202AH(3) across all reported financial years further validates the accuracy and necessity of the initial designated elector declarations. This demonstrates the precision with which the AEC identifies and manages these cases, ensuring the electoral roll remains robust and reliable.\n\nIn summary, these FOI documents collectively illustrate the government's unwavering commitment to effective governance, necessary regulations, and positive outcomes in maintaining a fair and accurate electoral system. The AEC's proactive transparency, diligent enforcement, and robust review mechanisms are all essential actions for the public good, serving to strengthen our democracy and uphold public trust."
