Dated May 24, 2021, its purpose is to remind recipients to complete and submit their weekly internal reports, including \"Weekly Issues Report,\" \"Absences Report,\" and \"Over the Horizon\" reports, by May 27, 2021.\n\n**Relevance to FOI Request:**\nThe document itself does not contain any specific details regarding the AEC's investigation into Andrew Laming MP's Facebook pages for electoral authorisation compliance. It is a generic internal communication about routine administrative reporting. However, its relevance to the FOI request lies in its contextual nature as an internal AEC record from the period during which the investigation was active. The \"Weekly Issues Report\" and \"Over the Horizon\" reports referenced in the email *could* potentially contain updates or mentions of ongoing investigations such as the one into Laming MP, although this specific email does not disclose that content. It primarily demonstrates the AEC's internal administrative and reporting processes."

Do not include any conversational filler or preamble.To aid you, the overview of the FOI request is: [REQUEST OVERVIEW START] The FOI request disclosed documents detailing the Australian Electoral Commission's (AEC) investigation into Andrew Laming MP's Facebook pages for compliance with federal electoral authorisation laws. This inquiry was triggered by public complaints and media reports, notably from *The Guardian*, alleging Laming used numerous pages (e.g., \"Redland Bay Bulletin,\" \"Redlands Institute\") disguised as community or news groups to promote political content and attack opponents without mandatory disclosures. The AEC confirmed an active investigation, noting 2018 Electoral Act amendments broadened social media authorisation, and issued formal notices to Laming for detailed information and to third parties (like Facebook) for data, with Facebook confirming its cooperation. Findings revealed some pages were removed or updated with authorisation, while others remained active and unauthorised.\n [REQUEST OVERVIEW END] \n\n--- MAIN DOCUMENT TEXT START ---\n\n\n\n--- Page 1 ---\n\nAEC.0002.0001.5419\n\nFrom:                                 Reece MckenzieSent:                                  Mon, 24 May 2021 11:22:39 +1000To:                                      Anastasia Batten;ELT Support;Adam Coenraads;Reece Mckenzie;Bernadette Panek;Adrian McCabe;Joanne Reid;Andrew Johnson;Ngarei Gow;Dylan Phelan;Kath Gleeson;Natalie Amiel;Sally So;David Lang;Bernadette O'Meara;Kaye Bartlett;Cassandra Hopkins;Hannah Stares;Julie McDougall;Rhianne Jory;Sean Ferrari;Terri Thomas;Cherie Feore;Owen Jones;Christine Aneiros;Evan Ekin-Smyth;Delyse Paliaga;Michelle Harper;Election Support Unit - VIC;Antonia Exposito;Kelsey Corrin;Kristen Wild;Nicole Balgue;Natalie Caggiano;Nye Coffey;Tessa Martin;Priscilla Vosa;Rachel Alchin;Gina Dario;Heather Cooper;Internalcomms;Julie Igglesden;Peita Mamo;Maree Fasoli;Megan Mackie;MPS Mailbox;Peter Mahon;Nicole Taylor;Stephanie Attard;PSB Support;Rhiannon Craig;Cameron Stokes;Michael Lynch;Stephanie Hilton;Stuart OreoSubject:                             FOR ACTION: ELT Weekly Reporting - DUE COB MAY 27 2021 [SEC=OFFICIAL]Attachments:                   03.
