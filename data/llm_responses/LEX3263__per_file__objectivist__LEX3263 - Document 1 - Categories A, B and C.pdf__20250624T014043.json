            "text": "The document presents Australian federal election vote data from 2013-2022 for New Zealand missions. Category A reveals a drastic shift in Wellington: in-person votes plummeted from 469-667 between 2013-2019 to zero in 2022, while postal votes simultaneously surged from single digits to 800. Category B demonstrates consistent high in-person voting (749-967 votes) at the Auckland Consulate-General across all years, including 2022. Category C details postal votes returned directly to the AEC from NZ, decreasing from 1,309-1,389 in 2016-2019 to 360 in 2022.\n\nThis data directly confirms the FOI request's assertion of bureaucratic overreach, evidencing the arbitrary elimination of in-person voting in Wellington and the coercion of citizens into a postal-only method.\n\n*   **Reason:** The decision to eliminate in-person voting in Wellington, despite its prior significant use and the continued viability of in-person voting in Auckland, is irrational. It prioritizes administrative convenience or an undisclosed \"risk analysis\" over the demonstrated preference and convenience of citizens, disregarding factual evidence of demand and feasibility. This reflects a non-rational, dictatorial approach by the government.\n*   **Individualism:** This action directly violates individual liberty and autonomy. By removing the option for in-person voting and forcing citizens into a singular, less preferred method, the government subordinates individual choice and convenience to its own administrative ease. It treats citizens as means to an end, stripping them of their freedom to choose how they exercise their rights, embodying a collectivist mindset that disdains individual self-direction.\n*   **Free Enterprise:** Analogously, the government's action runs contrary to principles of free enterprise. Instead of providing diverse, efficient \"services\" (voting methods) to meet \"consumer\" (citizen) demand, it eliminates a popular option and imposes a single, less optimal one. This demonstrates a monopolistic, coercive approach rather than a service-oriented one that respects choice and efficiency, as would be found in a free market.\n*   **Bureaucratic Obstacles:** The sudden and complete cessation of in-person voting in Wellington (0 votes in 2022 compared to hundreds prior) is direct evidence of a bureaucratic obstacle. The state actively removed a previously available, efficient mechanism for exercising a right, thereby creating a new hurdle that citizens were forced to navigate.\n*   **Forced Altruism:** The decision implicitly demands that citizens sacrifice their convenience and preferred method of voting for the unstated benefit or ease of the bureaucracy. This constitutes a subtle form of forced altruism, where individuals are compelled to subordinate their rational self-interest (convenient, efficient voting) to the state's administrative agenda.\n*   **Suppression of Productive Achievement:** By making the process of exercising a civic right more cumbersome and time-consuming, the bureaucracy imposes an unnecessary burden on productive individuals. This diversion of time, effort, and mental energy from their chosen, value-creating pursuits represents an indirect suppression of their productive achievement, as the state arbitrarily dictates conditions that consume individual resources."

  "prompt": "From an Objectivist perspective, summarize this specific document within the context of the FOI request. Analyze how the document reflects or contradicts the values of reason, individualism, and free enterprise. Note any evidence of bureaucratic obstacles, forced altruism, or suppression of productive achievement.\n\nTo aid you, the overview of the FOI request is: [REQUEST OVERVIEW START] The FOI documents reveal a stark Objectivist illustration of bureaucratic overreach, where \"risk analysis\" and administrative convenience arbitrarily supersede individual rights and rational self-interest. The decision to eliminate in-person voting in Wellington, coercing citizens into a less optimal postal method, directly violates their liberty and autonomy. This governmental imposition burdens productive individuals, forcing them to expend undue effort for the state's convenience and suppressing personal initiative, thereby embodying a collectivist mindset that sacrifices personal freedom for administrative ease. Such actions represent a dangerous erosion of liberty and productive achievement, demonstrating a government that dictates rather than serves, fundamentally departing from the principles of reason and limited government.\n [REQUEST OVERVIEW END] \n\n--- MAIN DOCUMENT TEXT START ---\n\n\n\n--- Page 1 ---\n\nNumber of declaration votes cast at the Australian High Commission in Wellington, New Zealand at each of the last four general elections.
