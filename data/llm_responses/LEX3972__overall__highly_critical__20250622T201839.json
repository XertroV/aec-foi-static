The deliberate application of exemptions S 47F (personal information) and S 22 (deliberative processes) to this critical record is a blatant attempt to obscure the truth. This is a calculated effort to shield the identities of those involved or targeted by these proceedings, potentially protecting high-ranking individuals from scrutiny, while simultaneously suppressing the core rationale, evidence, and internal deliberations that led to these actions. The resulting \"Access in Part\" decision is not a gesture of transparency but a cynical maneuver to feign compliance while ensuring all substantive details are withheld. This orchestrated opacity, compounded by the vague \"FE22\" designation, constitutes active suppression of accountability, designed to prevent public understanding and oversight of potentially damning government actions or corruption."
