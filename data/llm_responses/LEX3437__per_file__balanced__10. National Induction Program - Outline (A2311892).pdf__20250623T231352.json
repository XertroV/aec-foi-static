The program is designed to set \nclear expectations regarding the roles and responsibilities of Participants and the agency, and it will \nguide the performance and professional development of all staff, laying the foundations of the AEC’s \nworking environment, agency values and agency expectations. \n\nLearning outcomes \n\nBy the end of the program Participants will be able to: \n\n1.  Behave in accordance with the AEC values and commitments, and describe why they \n\nunderpin the work of the AEC. \n\n2.  Make decisions and demonstrate behaviours that represent the APS values and comply with \n\nthe APS Code of Conduct. \n\n3.  Promote and contribute to a positive organisational culture based on quality, agility and \n\nprofessionalism. \n\n4.  Apply learning to role that is compliant with policies, procedures and legislation relevant to the \n\nAEC. \n\n5.  Recognise the importance of transparency in the AEC and its impact on reputation and public \n\nperception. \n\n6.  Identify how their role contributes to AEC business outcomes and agency objectives. \n7.  Identify the internal and external factors of the AEC’s environment and consider them when \n\nperforming their role. \n\n8.  Explain the role of Parliament, the role the AEC plays in its formation and the importance of \n\npolitical neutrality. \n\n9.  Explain the guiding principles of electoral management and the three levels of government in \n\nAustralia.\n\n\n--- Page 2 ---\n\nProgram Design \n\nThe program is split across three (3) phases with modules and resources provided to support each \nphase. The program is designed to be delivered to a Participant over a period of five months and will \ncommence from two weeks prior to starting their role. \n\nPhase \n\nTiming \n\nOutcome \n\nPhase 1 – Pre-commencement \n\nModule 1 \n\nFrom 2 weeks prior to \ncommencement \n\nPhase 2 – Development \n\nDay 1 – 5 months \n\nModules 2 – 8 \n\nModules 10a or 10b \n\nPhase 3 – Follow up \n\nDay 1 – 5 months \n\nModules 2 – 8 \n\nModules 10a or 10b  \n\nReview \n\nModule 9 \n\n6 months \n\nThe Participant will have actioned all \nnecessary recruitment activities and have an \nunderstanding of the agency’s role and \nexpectations of staff and self. \n\nThe Line Manager has completed required \nactivities to ensure smooth transition on Day \none.  \n\nThe Participant and identified key staff \ninvolved in program delivery have successfully \nunderstood and participated in assigned \ninduction modules, including on the job \ntraining, and are confident that future activities \nwill be actioned in accordance with the AEC \nvalues and expectations. \n\nThe Participant and the Line Manager have \nhad meaningful discussion at all ‘Check-in \nPoints’ throughout the program. \n\nThe Line Manager and Executive Level Officer \nare confident that the programs overall \nlearning outcomes have been met. \n\nObservation of learning in action continues. \nFeedback has been provided to the NTEU for \nfurther program development and updates.  \n\nParticipation \n\nThe Participant group for the program will be staff that gain an ongoing or non-ongoing role within the \nAEC at the following levels: \n\n  APS2-APS6 \n\n  Executive Level (EL) \n\n  Senior Executive Services (SES) \n\nWhere AEC staff gain promotion, they will not be required to participate in the full program, but \nshould review the modules in consultation with their manager, and undertake identified compulsory \nactivities e.g. the AEC Foundation Programs. \n\nFor staff who gain a non-ongoing role within the AEC, they will be required to participate in the \nprogram up until the point in which their contract expires. If a staff member leaves the AEC at the \nconclusion of their contract and then returns within a six month period, they will be expected to \ncontinue working through the program until it is completed.\n\n\n--- Page 3 ---\n\nThe Program will require the identification of the following staff to support program delivery: \n\n  Line Manager - the responsible officer that will conduct the induction locally and either \n\nundertake or delegate induction activities. The Line Manager will also be responsible for \nproviding feedback on performance. \n\n  Local Induction Adviser - will help the Participant settle in and act as their primary contact on \n\ngeneral enquiries and day to day operational issues. \n\n  Executive Level Officer – through consultation with the Line Manager, they will ensure that \nexpectations of the program are being met, that mandatory training is being completed and \nthat the Participant is fit for the organisation prior to the probation period end date (where \napplicable). \n\n  Local Trainers - taken from the AEC’s assessed trainer pool, they may be responsible for \n\ndelivery of face to face session content for Participants in their office/state/branch or in other \nlocations, where required. \n\n  NTEU – will deliver face to face sessions to Participants in Canberra, including any relevant \n\ndelivery to National Office branches.  \n\nRoles and responsibilities for identified staff are clearly outlined in the resources developed for the \nprogram. \n\nCurriculum \n\nThe program is designed to provide the Participant with consistent guidance and an understanding of \nthe agency’s values, expected behaviours, corporate and operating environment, agency direction \nand purpose. \n\nSpecific information on the Participant’s job role, will be driven by their level and area of the \norganisation, and is accounted for under a capability framework and specific job role requirements. \nThese critical infrastructure pieces are being developed in parallel to the induction program. \n\nA set curriculum has been developed for the program outlining subject matter and staff involvement. \nThe curriculum provides visibility to all staff involved in the program about what will be discussed \nthroughout the five months. \n\nThe program aligns with other AEC timeframes and requirements including the development of \nIndividual Performance Plans (IPPs), probationary reporting and the completion of mandatory \ntraining. The program will direct the Participant and the Line Manager to the existing resources \navailable in these areas. \n\nThe curriculum features a two day AEC Foundation Program – National Experience in Canberra for \nthose staff at the APS6 – SES level and a one day Network Experience conducted in the states for \nthose staff at the APS2 – APS5 level. These programs are designed to support the Participant in \nmeeting the learning outcomes and provide an opportunity for the Participant to build their peer \nnetworks. Programs will be conducted twice annually with some travel required for identified staff. \n\nNOTE: As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the inaugural programs will be delivered as a virtual \nfacilitator led experience. The AEC Foundation Program – National Experience will be held virtually \nover a two week period, and the Network Experience will be held virtually over a one week period. \nOnce COVID-19 restrictions are eased, the AEC will review the Foundation Programs. \n\nSee Attachment A for an overview of the program curriculum. \n\nResources \n\nA series of induction modules have been developed by the NTEU to ensure that delivery of the \nprogram is nationally consistent, professional and in line with the curriculum and learning outcomes.\n\n\n--- Page 4 ---\n\nModules are available to identified staff through a dedicated National Induction Program SharePoint \npage located on the Learning Hub. Through the Learning Hub staff will be able to access the \nfollowing materials: \n\n  Manager Guides - each module will feature a Manager Guide that will provide the Line \n\nManager and the Local Induction Adviser with information and resources to support topics \nbeing discussed and undertaken at that time. \n\n  Checklists – each module will have a Checklist that will work in conjunction with the Manager \n\nGuide to ensure that Line Managers, the Local Induction Adviser and the Participant \nundertake their required actions. \n\n  Participant Guides – identified modules will feature a Participant Guide that will provide the \n\nParticipant with additional reading and required actions to support their learning. \n\n  Resources – each module will have assigned resources including scenarios, case studies, \ntemplates and activities to support the delivery of the program and ensure consistency. \n\n \n\n \n\nInduction eLearning course – an induction eLearning course has been developed allowing the \nParticipant to gain an initial understanding of the AEC’s working environment, including the \nAEC values and expectations. \n\nInduction videos – a series of short videos have been recorded by members of the Executive \nLeadership Team introducing themselves, welcoming the Participant to the agency and \npromoting specific key information e.g. the AEC Corporate Plan, strategic direction and their \nexpectations of staff. \n\nAdditional program resources including staff roles and responsibilities have been developed, as well \nas facilitator guides and facilitator resources for the AEC Foundation Program – National and \nNetwork Experience. \n\nConsultation \n\nThe NTEU reviewed current AEC content against the program objectives, identifying gaps in \nresources and engaging with business owners in content development. The NTEU designed and \ndeveloped materials to support the program, and business owners were consulted and reviewed all \nmodule content and eLearning as required. \n\nThe Learning and Development Community of Practice supported the program through testing, which \nensured the program was fit for purpose and user friendly. \n\nFeedback has been discussed throughout the consultation phase and changes have been made to \nthe program as required. \n\nAll identified staff who participate in the program are required to provide feedback and undertake an \nevaluation of the program upon completion of each module.\n\n"
