It serves as a reminder to a wide range of AEC staff to submit their weekly reports, including \"Weekly Issues Report,\" \"Absences Report,\" and \"Over the Horizon\" via SharePoint links. The email specifies a deadline of COB 13 May 2021 and mentions an attached \"Weekly Report for week ending 7 May 2021\" for reference. It is a procedural communication for routine internal administrative reporting.\n\n### Relevance to FOI Request\nThe document has minimal direct relevance to the FOI request concerning the AEC's investigation into Andrew Laming MP's Facebook pages. It is a generic internal administrative email about routine weekly reporting within the AEC. It does not contain any information, details, or updates specific to the Laming investigation, electoral authorisation laws, social media compliance, or any related findings or actions. Its presence in the disclosed documents suggests it was part of a broader collection of internal communications, but it does not contribute to understanding the specifics or progress of the Laming inquiry."

Do not include any conversational filler or preamble.To aid you, the overview of the FOI request is: [REQUEST OVERVIEW START] The FOI request disclosed documents detailing the Australian Electoral Commission's (AEC) investigation into Andrew Laming MP's Facebook pages for compliance with federal electoral authorisation laws. This inquiry was triggered by public complaints and media reports, notably from *The Guardian*, alleging Laming used numerous pages (e.g., \"Redland Bay Bulletin,\" \"Redlands Institute\") disguised as community or news groups to promote political content and attack opponents without mandatory disclosures. The AEC confirmed an active investigation, noting 2018 Electoral Act amendments broadened social media authorisation, and issued formal notices to Laming for detailed information and to third parties (like Facebook) for data, with Facebook confirming its cooperation. Findings revealed some pages were removed or updated with authorisation, while others remained active and unauthorised.\n [REQUEST OVERVIEW END] \n\n--- MAIN DOCUMENT TEXT START ---\n\n\n\n--- Page 1 ---\n\nAEC.0002.0001.3605\n\nFrom:                                 ELT SupportSent:                                  Mon, 10 May 2021 12:11:03 +1000To:                                      Anastasia Batten;ELT Support;Adam Coenraads;Reece Mckenzie;Bernadette Panek;Adrian McCabe;Joanne Reid;Andrew Johnson;Ngarei Gow;David Lang;Gina Dario;Dylan Phelan;Kath Gleeson;Natalie Amiel;Sally So;Bernadette O'Meara;Kaye Bartlett;Cassandra Hopkins;Hannah Stares;Julie McDougall;Rhianne Jory;Sean Ferrari;Terri Thomas;Cherie Feore;Owen Jones;Christine Aneiros;Evan Ekin-Smyth;Delyse Paliaga;Michelle Harper;Election Support Unit - VIC;Antonia Exposito;Kelsey Corrin;Kristen Wild;Nicole Balgue;Natalie Caggiano;Nye Coffey;Tessa Martin;Priscilla Vosa;Rachel Alchin;Heather Cooper;Internalcomms;Julie Igglesden;Peita Mamo;Maree Fasoli;Megan Mackie;MPS Mailbox;Peter Mahon;Nicole Taylor;Stephanie Attard;PSB Support;Rhiannon Craig;Cameron Stokes;Michael Lynch;Stephanie Hilton;Stuart OreoSubject:                             FOR ACTION: ELT Weekly Reporting - DUE COB 13 MAY 2021 [SEC=OFFICIAL]Attachments:                   Weekly Reports 07.05.2021.pdfGood morning,  The SharePoint links for weekly reporting are live and ready for your input.Please update the reports with all key information including risks, issues, movements and any divisional office closures via the links provided below.
