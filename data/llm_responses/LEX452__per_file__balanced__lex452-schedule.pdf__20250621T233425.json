It confirms the AEC's administrative process regarding Zi Chun Wang's donor disclosure obligations for the 2013/2014 financial year. Specifically, it shows that the AEC notified Zi Chun Wang of their duty to disclose, issued a reminder, and ultimately acknowledged the successful submission of the required \"Individual Donor Return.\" This aligns with the FOI request overview, which states that the released documents confirm the AEC's administrative process and the submission of the return, while noting the absence of the actual disclosure content and the presence of redactions (though redactions are not evident on this particular schedule page itself, they are mentioned as present in the underlying released letters)."
