            "text": "This document outlines the Australian Electoral Commission's (AEC) decision to affirm the deregistration of VOTEFLUX.ORG | Upgrade Democracy! (VFUD) following a review. Despite VFUD submitting a list of 4,680 members, well exceeding the 1,500 minimum, the AEC's \"Methodology\" requires a list of 1,500-1,650 names for testing. Crucially, the document admits that the delegate, contrary to the AEC's own guide, did not return VFUD's larger list but unilaterally took the \"top 1,650 names\" for testing. The AEC explicitly states that it \"accepts that it cannot draw any relevant conclusion from this testing process\" and \"placed no weight on its results,\" yet still affirmed the deregistration, rejecting VFUD's 4,680-name list as insufficient proof on its own. The AEC also rejected VFUD's \"excess capacity\" argument, which posited that the party had many more members than tested, and dismissed an alternative, more comprehensive testing methodology proposed by VFUD, stating it was \"not persuaded\" such an approach was justified. The document concludes by outlining the process for appealing the decision to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, including a substantial fee.\n\nFrom an Objectivist perspective, this document embodies the government overreach and assault on individual rights described in the FOI request overview.\n\n**Reason:** The AEC's decision profoundly contradicts the value of reason. The Commission *admits* that the specific testing process that led to VFUD's deregistration was flawed and that it \"cannot draw any relevant conclusion\" from it, yet it proceeds to affirm the deregistration based on this invalidated process. This is a blatant disregard for objective reality and logical consistency, prioritizing administrative rigidity over truth. The rejection of VFUD's statistically sound alternative methodology and \"excess capacity\" argument, despite the demonstrable flaw in the AEC's own application, further illustrates an irrational adherence to arbitrary rules over effective and accurate verification. The AEC's claim that its \"Methodology\" is \"rational, practical and fair\" (Para 22) stands in direct contradiction to its own admission of its flawed application in this specific case (Para 21).\n\n**Individualism:** The AEC's actions directly undermine individualism. By rejecting VFUD's list of 4,680 members and insisting on an arbitrary 1,500-1,650 name limit, the AEC disregards the productive efforts and free association of thousands of individuals. It forces a political party, a collective expression of individual will, to conform to a bureaucratic dictate rather than acknowledging its actual strength and membership. The refusal to provide details of individuals confirming or denying membership (Para 26), deemed \"not relevant to the Commission's inquiry,\" strips individuals of transparency regarding how their information is used by the state, further eroding individual autonomy.\n\n**Free Enterprise / Productive Achievement:** This document provides clear evidence of the suppression of productive achievement and the imposition of bureaucratic obstacles.\n\n*   **Suppression of Productive Achievement:** VFUD exerted significant productive effort to accrue 4,680 members, vastly exceeding the 1,500 minimum required. The AEC's rejection of this larger list and its insistence on a limited, arbitrarily sized sample (which it then admits it mishandled) actively punishes this excellence. Instead of rewarding VFUD for demonstrating overwhelming support, the AEC uses its own bureaucratic rules to dismiss this achievement, effectively disincentivizing going beyond the bare minimum.\n*   **Bureaucratic Obstacles:** The arbitrary 1,500-1,650 name limit, coupled with the AEC's admitted failure to apply its own sampling methodology correctly to VFUD's larger list, constitutes a significant bureaucratic obstacle. Instead of adapting to a greater demonstration of support, the bureaucracy imposes rigid, self-defeating rules and then fails to even follow its *own* procedures. The subsequent appeal process, with its substantial $962 fee, adds another financial burden and bureaucratic hurdle for individuals seeking to challenge the state's irrational decisions.\n*   **Forced Altruism (Implicit):** While not explicitly stated as \"forced altruism,\" the AEC's prioritization of its internal \"Methodology\" and administrative \"convenience\" (implied by the arbitrary list limits and rejection of alternative, more accurate testing) over the objective verification of a party's legitimate membership forces VFUD to sacrifice its achievements and the free association of its members for the sake of the state's bureaucratic preferences. The statement that \"it is, therefore, incumbent on VFUD in this case to demonstrate to the Commission that it should not be deregistered\" (Para 30) shifts the burden entirely onto the productive entity, even when the state's own verification process has been admitted as flawed."

The AEC's use of a demonstrably flawed and irrational membership testing methodology, despite internal expert admission of its statistical invalidity, constitutes a profound disregard for objective reality and reason—foundations essential for personal freedom and a just society. By arbitrarily limiting and rejecting VOTEFLUX's significant productive efforts in accruing members, the AEC actively suppresses individual initiative and disincentivizes rational self-interest, effectively punishing excellence and forcing stagnation under the guise of bureaucratic \"convenience.\" This prioritization of administrative \"costs\" over truth and liberty exemplifies the dangers of collectivism, where the individual is sacrificed for the arbitrary will of the state, thereby stifling the free association and productive endeavors of citizens and undermining the proper role of government as a protector of rights.\n [REQUEST OVERVIEW END] \n\n--- MAIN DOCUMENT TEXT START ---\n\n\n\n--- Page 1 ---\n\nDocument No 31 \n\nAEC reference: LEX1994 \n\nBy email: \n\nBy email: \n\nDear \n\n and \n\nReview of decision under s 141(4) of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 – notice of decision \nunder s 141(7) \n\n1.\n\n2.\n\n3.\n\n and \n\nThe Australian Electoral Commission (the Commission) refers to the written applications\nmade by \nrespectively (applications for review), for review of the delegate’s decision to deregister\nVOTEFLUX.ORG | Upgrade Democracy!

\n\n(b)  the delegate’s decision made under section 137(6)(a) of the Electoral Act to deregister \nVFUD, with the notice of the reasons for the decision under section 137(6)(b) of the \nElectoral Act dated 24 March 2022 (reasons for decision); \n\n(c)  the material and other information before the delegate in making the delegate’s \n\ndecision, including the list of 1,649 names provided by VFUD on 7 December 2021 \n(7 December 2021 list); the list of 4,680 names provided by VFUD under cover of a \nletter dated 13 February 2022 (13 February 2022 list); and the results of membership \ntesting of the 7 December 2021 list and the 13 February 2022 list set out at [16]-[24] of \nthe delegate’s reasons for decision; \n\n(d)  correspondence between the Commission Secretariat and VFUD’s Registered Officer \n\n(\n\n relating to the Commission’s review of the delegate’s decision;  \n\n(e)  the methodology for testing membership lists as outlined in the AEC’s Party \n\nRegistration Guide and published on its website (Methodology); \n\n(f)  Part XI of the Electoral Act. \n\nMr Kaye’s submissions \n\n7. \n\nIn summary, in support of his application for review, \n\n submitted that: \n\n(a)  VFUD has at least 1,500 members, as VFUD submitted a membership list of 4,680 \n\nnames to the Commission; \n\n(b)  the Methodology is an invalid means of testing whether a political party, not being a \n\nParliamentary party, has “at least 1,500 members” for the purposes of section 137 of \nthe Electoral Act, because the Methodology involves testing only a sample of the \nnames on a party membership list limited to 1,500 – 1,650 names;  \n\n(c)  the Methodology erroneously assumes that a membership list limited in this way is an \n\nexhaustive list of the relevant party’s members; \n\n(d)  the Methodology may lead to a high probability of rejecting a valid list in some \n\ncircumstances, and in the case of VFUD, the methodology used by the delegate \nresulted in a 99% fail rate; \n\n(e)  the filtering out of the names on a membership list that cannot be matched to the \n\nElectoral Roll (or otherwise excluded) without replacement increases the chance that \na valid list will be rejected; \n\nPage 2 \n\ns 47F (Personal Privacy)s 47F (Personal Privacy\n\n\n--- Page 3 ---\n\n(f)  the delegate’s determination to test only the top 1,650 names on the 13 February \n\n2022 list, rather than selecting names at random from that list, invalidated the testing \nand was unfair;  \n\n(g)  the AEC does not provide information or feedback as to the outcome of membership \ntesting for each individual checked against the Electoral Roll or asked to confirm \nmembership, and this is procedurally unfair; and \n\n(h)  VFUD must be re-registered pending the outcome of review. \n\n submissions \n\n8. \n\nIn summary, in support of his application for review, \n\nsubmitted that:  \n\n(a)  VFUD should have been provided with a list of members who confirmed or denied \n\nmembership in the testing process and details of the timeframe for responses sought \nfrom them; \n\n(b)  the Commission should review the statistical method used in relation to the “top” 1,650 \nnames taken from the 13 February 2022 list for testing, and whether this resulted in \nerror; and \n\n(c)  the Commission should provide the mathematical proof of the sampling method used, \nand review the method and determine the rate at which this method would return a \nfalse negative. \n\nMethodology  \n\n9. \n\nThe Commission noted that the Electoral Act does not provide a method for ascertaining \nwhether a political party satisfies the numerical membership requirements of the Electoral Act. \nThe Commission considered the Methodology (as outlined in the AEC’s Party Registration \nGuide) for determining whether a non-Parliamentary party satisfies these membership \nrequirements. The Commission noted that the Methodology was the same as the sampling \nmethodology recommended by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS). The Commission \nconcluded that the Methodology was appropriate for this purpose. \n\n10. \n\nIn summary, the Methodology requires: \n\n(a)  the provision of a membership list of between 1,500 and 1,650 names for membership \n\ntesting; \n\n(b)  the removal from that list of:  \n\ni.  names that cannot be matched, either via an automated process or manually, \n\nto the Electoral Roll; \n\nii.  names relied on by another party for the purpose of registration or continued \n\nregistration; \n\niii.  duplicate names.   \n\nPage 3 \n\ns 47F (Personal Privacy)s 47F (Personal Privacy)\n\n\n--- Page 4 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 5 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 6 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 7 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 8 ---\n\nThe AEC requires a party to choose a maximum of 1,650 members for the \nmembership list included with their application. The AEC will return a membership list \nin excess of 1,650 members and ask the party to lodge the membership list with \nbetween 1,500 and 1,650 members.  \n\nThe Commission further notes that the delegate did not in fact return the 13 February \n2022 list, which contained the names of 4,680 individuals. Rather, contrary to the \nGuide and the Methodology, the delegate instructed an officer of the Commission to \ntake the top 1,650 names to create another list (the top 1,650 names list) and to test \nthe top 1,650 names list as described above. The Commission accepts that it cannot \ndraw any relevant conclusion from this testing process. The Commission has therefore \nplaced no weight on its results. The Commission accepts the relevant submissions of \n\n and \nsubmissions further.  \n\n in this regard, and it is unnecessary to consider these \n\n22. The Commission rejects the submission that the fact that VFUD provided a list of 4,680 names \n\nto the Commission was sufficient evidence that VFUD has at least 1,500 members. The \nCommission could not be satisfied that VFUD met the numerical membership requirements of \nthe Electoral Act on this basis alone; and the Commission was unable to test this list in \naccordance with the Methodology, which is in all the circumstances a rational, practical and fair \nway of testing the membership requirements of a non-Parliamentary party under the Electoral \nAct. \n\n23. The Commission also notes that the review applicants made criticisms of a more general nature \nregarding various aspects of the Methodology. The Commission’s response to these criticisms \nis set out below. \n\nFiltering  \n\n24. Both \n\n and \n\nobjected to the Commission’s practice of filtering out the names \n\non a membership list that cannot be matched to the Electoral Roll (or are otherwise excluded) \nwithout seeking to replace those names with the names of any additional members that a party \nmay be able to provide on the basis that it increases the error rate. \n\n25. The Commission rejects the submission that the filtering out of these names from a membership \n\nlist containing between 1,500 to 1,650 names increases the error rate (that is, the risk of \nerroneously rejecting a submitted membership list that in fact contains 1,500 party members). \nThe names taken out of such a list at this stage of the process are duplicate names and the \nnames of people who are ineligible to be included in counting the members of a non-\nParliamentary Party (being the deceased, those not enrolled on the Electoral Roll, individuals \nunder 18 years or relied on for registration purposes by another party (see section 123A)). It is \nonly after these names have been taken out of a submitted list that the membership testing \nsample size and maximum number of permitted denials can be properly calculated in \naccordance with the Methodology. The membership testing sample size is calculated relative to \nthe size of the list of names after filtering, not before. For example, one party could submit a list \nof 1650 names, 150 of which need to be filtered out. Another party could submit a list of 1500 \nnames, none of which need to be filtered out. The sample size for both parties, in accordance \nwith ABS advice, would be 18 individuals, with 0 denials permissible to pass testing. The \n\nPage 8 \n\ns 47F (Personal Privacy)s 47F (Personal Privacy)s 47F (Personal Privacys 47F (Personal Privacy\n\n\n--- Page 9 ---\n\nprobably of rejecting a valid list of 1500 members for either hypothetical party will be 0%. \nClearly, the error rate remains the same in both hypothetical cases, and does not increase \nbecause one party has had more names filtered out. \n\n26. Both \n\n and \n\n challenged the fact that the Commission did not as a matter of \npractice provide parties with details of the individuals affirming or denying party membership. \nThe Commission rejects the proposition that this constitutes a denial of procedural fairness. The \nidentity of these individuals is not relevant to the Commission’s inquiry, the purpose of which is \nto establish whether the party meets the numerical membership requirements under and in \naccordance with the Electoral Act by testing a membership list supplied by a party for \n have proposed any other relevant \nregistration purposes. Neither\npurpose. In keeping with the relevant purpose, and in conformity with section 137(2) of the \nElectoral Act and the interests of procedural fairness, the delegate gave VFUD an opportunity to \nprovide a statement setting out why VFUD should not be deregistered under section 137. \n responded by letter dated 13 February 2022, both \nVFUD’s Registered Officer, \nchallenging the Methodology and providing the 13 February 2022 list.  \n\nExcess Capacity argument \n\n27. In his “excess capacity” argument, \n\n contends that the Commission’s membership \n\ntesting process assumes, contrary to fact, that the 1,500 to 1,650 names submitted on a list of \nthe kind sought by the Commission are the only members of the relevant party. \nto demonstrate the weaknesses of this assumption by reference to statistical analyses in \nrelation to a “hypothetical case” consisting of a party with 9,000 members, of whom 4,500 are \nnot “validatable”, 1,800 would deny membership if asked by the AEC and 2,700 would be \n“legitimate”. These analyses proceed on the basis that the “hypothetical party” has provided a \nlist to the Commission comprising 1,650 party members who have been randomly selected from \nits pool of 4,500 “validatable” members. \n\n sought \n\n28. In response to this argument, the Commission notes that the composition of the list provided for \n\nthe purpose of membership testing is for the party to determine. As noted above, the \nCommission expects that a list provided for the express purpose of numerical membership \ntesting will be a high quality one, that is, a list that the party considers accurately records the \nnames of at least 1,500 party members (noting that the party can in fact submit up to 1,650 \nnames). Accordingly, the Commission rejects the hypothetical case and statistical analyses \n because they start from the premise that it is reasonable for a party to \nprovided by \nprovide a list of members who have been randomly selected without regard to whether those \nmembers would likely meet the requirements of the Electoral Act.  \n\nAlternative Methodology \n\n29. While not raised by the review applicants, the Commission notes for completeness the \n\nalternative methodology proposed by \nletter to the delegate. That alternative methodology, as articulated in the response, is as follows: \n\n on behalf of VFUD in his 13 February 2022 \n\nPage 9 \n\ns 47F (Personal Privacy)s 47F (Personal Privacy)s 47F (Personal Privacy)s 47F (Personal Privacy)s 47F (Personal Privacys 47F (Personal Privacys 47F (Personal Privacys 47F (Personal Privacy\n\n\n--- Page 10 ---\n\nBonus: a decisively superior methodology at no additional cost \n\nWe note that the AEC could, at very little cost (time, energy, expense, etc), dramatically increase the \nconfidence of their membership testing by accepting lists of more than 1650 members and following \nthis procedure: \n\n1.  Automatically match all possible members against the electoral roll (as is already done). The \ncost of automatically matching names against the electoral roll is constant regardless of the \ninput size (because it is done by computer). If less than 1650 names are automatically \nmatched, proceed to manual verification (as is done currently) and stop at 1650. Note that this \nwill only ever save the AEC time and money. It is economically rational to do this. \n2.  Where more than 1650 members can be automatically matched, record this number. \n3.  Select 1650 names from that list and conduct 53 trials. use the failure rate to estimate the \n\nprobability of a member being valid. \n\n4.  Use this probability, combined with the length of the list in step (2) to estimate the valid \n\nmembership population of the party being tested. \n\n5.  Calculate error measurements and confidence intervals, etc. (Or evaluate against \n\npredetermined thresholds.) \n\n6.  Determine eligibility. \n\n30. In assessing this argument, it should be borne in mind that, both before the delegate and on \nreview, a party’s task is to show the Commission that it should not be deregistered for the \nreason set out in the notice given under section 137(1) of the Electoral Act. The Commission \nalso observes that registration under the Electoral Act confers on political parties a number of \nbenefits – including the provision of public funds if certain additional criteria are met. It is, \ntherefore, incumbent on VFUD in this case to demonstrate to the Commission that it should not \nbe deregistered for the reason set out in section 137(1)(b) of the Electoral Act, being the reason \nset out in the notice. \n\n31. The Commission does not consider the proposed alternative methodology to be appropriate for \nthe purpose of determining whether a party has 1500 members in accordance with the Electoral \nAct. This is because such proposed alternative methodology requires the Commission to \nassume that the results of testing conducted on a random sample of 1,650 names drawn from a \nbroader list of members may reasonably be relied upon to form a view on the probability that \nthat broader list (which may be many multiples of 1,650) contains 1,500 members who meet the \nrequirements of the Electoral Act. The Commission is not persuaded that such an assumption \nwould be justified.  \n\nStatement of review rights \n\n32.
