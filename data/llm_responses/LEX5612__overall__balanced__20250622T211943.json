            "text": "This document package comprises released materials stemming from an FOI request, focusing on the operations of the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) and its Electoral Integrity Assurance Taskforce (EIAT) during the lead-up to and immediate aftermath of the 2022 federal election.\n\n### Main Purpose of the FOI Request\n\nThe FOI request aimed to obtain information regarding the Australian Electoral Commission's (AEC) and the Electoral Integrity Assurance Taskforce (EIAT)'s activities, planning, and operational updates related to ensuring the integrity and smooth conduct of the 2022 federal election. This includes details on various aspects of the election process, from enrolment and nominations to voting, disinformation management, and vote counting.\n\n### Documents from the FOI Request\n\nThe released documents consist of:\n\n*   **Electoral Integrity Assurance Taskforce Board Meeting Minutes:** These minutes detail discussions and updates from high-level meetings of the EIAT Board, spanning from January 2022 to June 2022.\n*   **Record of Meeting:** These documents provide daily operational updates and discussions from various meetings, also within the same period (January to May 2022).\n\nAll documents were released \"in part,\" indicating that certain sections were exempted under various provisions of the FOI Act, including S 7(2A)(b), S 33, S 34(3), S 37, S 42, S 47E, and S 47F.\n\n### Main Content from the FOI Request Documents\n\nThe documents provide a chronological overview of the AEC's and EIAT's activities and challenges during the election cycle:\n\n*   **Early Readiness & Mobilisation (Jan-March 2022):** Initial meetings of the EIAT focused on establishing the taskforce's framework, roles, and planning for the electoral cycle. The AEC entered its \"mobilise\" phase from January 31, 2022, processing declaration envelopes and assisting state electoral commissions. The AEC also launched its Disinformation Register early in the cycle.\n*   **Close of Rolls & Nominations (April 2022):**\n    *   Writs were issued on April 11, and candidate nominations opened.\n    *   The \"Close of Rolls\" occurred on April 18, with significant electronic enrolment transactions (over 700,000 between announcement and close). Total enrolled voters reached 17.2 million (97% of eligible population), a 1.1 million increase since 2019.\n    *   Candidate nominations closed on April 21, showing an increase in House of Representatives candidates (to ~1120) and a decrease in Senate candidates (to ~390) compared to 2019.\n    *   Concerns were noted regarding political party text messages for postal vote applications (PVAs) and their authorization.\n*   **Voting Operations & Disinformation (April-May 2022):**\n    *   Postal Vote Applications (PVAs) surged, with projections up to three times the 2019 amount. Over 2.8 million PVAs were received by closure.\n    *   Pre-poll voting commenced on May 9, with a high uptake (over 5.5 million pre-poll votes by May 21). The AEC expected around 4 million total pre-poll votes.\n    *   Secure Telephone Voting (STV) was implemented for eligible voters (e.g., blind, low vision, Antarctic, COVID-positive), with registrations reaching over 76,500 by polling day.\n    *   Ballot paper printing and distribution for 50 million ballot papers were on track.\n    *   The AEC's \"Stop and Consider\" disinformation campaign achieved significant reach, with millions of digital and social media impressions, directing users to the AEC's disinformation webpage.\n    *   Temporary Election Workforce (TEW) recruitment progressed, filling over 100,000 positions.\n*   **Polling Day & Vote Counting (May-June 2022):**\n    *   All polling places successfully opened on election day.\n    *   Over 7 million voters cast their vote before election day (via post, STV, or pre-poll).\n    *   Vote counting for both the House of Representatives and Senate progressed steadily. By June 7, the House count was well underway, with 14 seats declared and an expectation of half declared by the end of the week. Senate counts were two-thirds complete.\n    *   Return rates for active postal vote applications were high (approx. 2.37 million out of 2.7 million active PVAs).\n    *   Projected voter turnout for 2022 was noted to be trending 2-3% lower than 2019, consistent with international trends post-COVID-19.\n    *   The final vote count figures were presented, with writs for all 151 House of Representatives seats completed and expected to be returned to the Governor General by June 23, 2022."
