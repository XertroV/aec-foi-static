Key points include:\n*   **Perceived Imbalance:** The letter highlights that while a \"tick\" is likely treated as a formal \"yes\" vote by the AEC, a \"cross\" is considered ambiguous and thus informal. This is described as \"fundamentally lopsided\" and potentially distorting the national vote by artificially skewing results towards the 'yes' case.\n*   **Call for Consistency:** Dutton and Cash argue that if a tick counts for 'yes,' then a cross should similarly count for 'no' to ensure fairness and impartiality in the referendum.\n*   **Request for Legal Advice:** The letter demands that the AEC release the legal advice from the Attorney-General's Department, which the AEC has reportedly relied upon for its policy, asserting that any legal professional privilege has been waived through public statements.\n*   **Call to Reconsider:** The letter urges the AEC to reconsider its current approach to uphold the integrity and fairness of the referendum process."

The handbook indicates that while a tick will likely be \ntreated by the AEC as a ‘yes’ vote, a cross on its own is considered by the AEC to \nbe ambiguous, and therefore will be treated as informal. \n\nWith the greatest of respect, this approach is fundamentally lopsided. It risks \ndistorting the national vote. \n\nAustralians expect the AEC to act fairly and impartially in the execution of its duties. \nCounting a tick as a formal vote while simultaneously excluding a cross as informal \ncould artificially skew the count towards the yes vote, and fail to accurately reflect the \nwill of the Australian people.\n\n\n--- Page 2 ---\n\nWe understand that the AEC’s current approach is broadly consistent with the \napproach that it has adopted in previous referendums. However, just because the \nAEC has adopted this approach before, does not mean that it is appropriate or \nlegally correct.  \n\nGiven the AEC’s purported reliance on legal advice from the Attorney-General’s \nDepartment in reaching this view, the AEC should release this advice so the \nAustralian public can properly consider the AEC’s position. We note that any legal \nprofessional privilege that existed in the legal advice has clearly been waived by the \nAEC through its public statements about the advice over many years.  \n\nMore importantly, we call on you to reconsider the AEC’s approach. If a tick counts \nfor yes, a cross should count for no. To do otherwise gives the yes case an unfair \nadvantage, and has the potential to undermine the impartiality and fairness of the \nreferendum. \n\nIt is, after all, in the interests of every Australian to ensure that this basic standard of \nfairness is applied. \n\nYours sincerely \n\nPETER DUTTON \n\nMICHAELIA CASH \n\n24 August 2023\n\n\n\n--- Page 1 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 2 ---\n\n\n\nProvide only the markdown formatted summary text.
