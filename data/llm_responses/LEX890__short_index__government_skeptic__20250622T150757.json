An FOI request was necessary to obtain the \"Exchange of Information Agreement 2020-23\" between the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) and the New South Wales Electoral Commission (NSWEC).\n\nThis points to a proactive decision by these electoral bodies to withhold details of their data exchange protocols from public scrutiny. While the agreement itself is listed, its contents are conspicuously absent from the provided documents, preventing any meaningful public oversight.\n\nFrom a skeptic's perspective, the requirement for an FOI to access a basic information-sharing agreement between two significant government bodies highlights an inherent default towards opacity. The very existence of such an agreement raises questions about the scope and necessity of data pooling between electoral commissions, and without its details, the potential for overreach into citizen data, questionable data usage, or even inefficiencies in inter-agency cooperation remains unexamined and unaccountable. The public is left in the dark about how their information is being managed and shared by electoral authorities.\n\nProvide only the markdown formatted summary text. Do not include any conversational filler or preamble."
