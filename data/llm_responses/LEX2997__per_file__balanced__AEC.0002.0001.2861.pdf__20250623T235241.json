            "text": "This document is an internal Microsoft Teams meeting invitation for the Australian Electoral Commission's (AEC) Executive Leadership Team (ELT) on May 3, 2021. Organised by Terri Thomas, the meeting's subject is \"ELT papers + teams invite [SEC=OFFICIAL],\" indicating a high-level, confidential discussion among senior AEC officials, including potentially the Electoral Commissioner (Tom Rogers).\n\nIts relevance to the FOI request lies in its temporal context and the nature of the meeting. The FOI request details an active AEC investigation into Andrew Laming MP's electoral authorisation compliance, which was a high-profile matter generating public complaints and media attention around 2021. As an ELT meeting, it would typically cover significant operational, compliance, or strategic matters. Therefore, it is highly probable that discussions or updates related to major, ongoing investigations, such as the Laming case, would have been part of the \"ELT papers\" or agenda, demonstrating senior leadership oversight of such compliance matters during the period of the investigation."

Do not include any conversational filler or preamble.To aid you, the overview of the FOI request is: [REQUEST OVERVIEW START] The FOI request disclosed documents detailing the Australian Electoral Commission's (AEC) investigation into Andrew Laming MP's Facebook pages for compliance with federal electoral authorisation laws. This inquiry was triggered by public complaints and media reports, notably from *The Guardian*, alleging Laming used numerous pages (e.g., \"Redland Bay Bulletin,\" \"Redlands Institute\") disguised as community or news groups to promote political content and attack opponents without mandatory disclosures. The AEC confirmed an active investigation, noting 2018 Electoral Act amendments broadened social media authorisation, and issued formal notices to Laming for detailed information and to third parties (like Facebook) for data, with Facebook confirming its cooperation. Findings revealed some pages were removed or updated with authorisation, while others remained active and unauthorised.\n [REQUEST OVERVIEW END] \n\n--- MAIN DOCUMENT TEXT START ---\n\n\n\n--- Page 1 ---\n\nAEC.0002.0001.2861\n\nOrganiser: Terri ThomasSubject: ELT papers + teams invite [SEC=OFFICIAL]Required: Tim Courtney; Tom Rogers; Lynn White; Jeff Pope; Holly Castro; Thomas RyanLocation: TEAMSStart time: 3 May 2021 16:00:00 +1000End time: 3 May 2021 17:30:00 +1000________________________________________________________________________________Microsoft Teams meetingJoin on your computer or mobile appClick here to join the meeting<https://teams.microsoft.com/l/meetup-join/19%3ameeting_YjdhNWUyMDUtZDliMi00Mzc2LTk4ZjgtODgxOGMxMDQ5ZGM5%40thread.v2/0?context=%7b%22Tid%22%3a%22c1eefc4f-a78a-4616-a218-48ba01757af3%22%2c%22Oid%22%3a%22df8ad216-d4fb-4c29-a3ac-510d5c1b1bb8%22%7d>[https://www.aec.gov.au/_template/css/img/aec-logo-homepage.png]This meeting invitation was generated by the AEC Microsoft Teams instanceLearn More<https://aka.ms/JoinTeamsMeeting> | Meeting options<https://teams.microsoft.com/meetingOptions/?organizerId=df8ad216-d4fb-4c29-a3ac-510d5c1b1bb8&tenantId=c1eefc4f-a78a-4616-a218-48ba01757af3&threadId=19_meeting_YjdhNWUyMDUtZDliMi00Mzc2LTk4ZjgtODgxOGMxMDQ5ZGM5@thread.v2&messageId=0&language=en-US>________________________________________________________________________________\n\n"
