The released document, \"Turner Report 300621_Redacted\" (30/06/2021), details the methodology of a voter research survey commissioned to assess whether the party name \"The New Liberals\" would confuse voters regarding identification of their intended party or its relationship with others. The study employed an online, computer-assisted survey of 2,036 Australian voters (n=1,863 effective after weighting), conducted March 6-9, 2021, using an experimental design with four mock ballot papers (Ballot A-D) to vary the prominence of \"The New Liberals\" relative to the Liberal Party. A crucial follow-up question (Q24) after providing factual information allowed for direct measurement of voter misidentification. While the report thoroughly outlines the research design, methodology, and Dr. Turner's expert opinion on its appropriateness, the actual survey findings and statistical results remain almost entirely redacted."

  "prompt": "Create a concise, single-paragraph summary in markdown format of the following FOI request summary:\n\nSummary:\n\n## Summary of FOI Request Documents\n\n### 1. Main Purpose of the FOI Request\n\nThe main purpose of the FOI request by Paul Farrell was to obtain \"The supplemental report authored by Michael Turner\" which was referenced at paragraph 27 of a determination by the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) regarding party registration. This suggests the report was pertinent to a decision made by the AEC.\n\n### 2. Documents from the FOI Request\n\nThe following document was retrieved and released in response to the FOI request:\n\n*   **Turner Report 300621_Redacted** (dated 30/06/2021): This is the requested \"Report of Dr Michael Turner.\" It includes:\n    *   Acknowledgements, instructions, and author details.\n    *   Dr. Michael Turner's qualifications and professional experience (Appendix 1).\n    *   Detailed explanation of the research design and methodology.\n    *   The full survey questionnaire used (Appendix 2).\n    *   A sample House of Representatives Ballot Paper (Appendix 4).\n    *   The original \"Research Report\" dated 18 March 2021 (Appendix 6), which the supplemental report refers to, though largely redacted.\n    *   Letters of instruction from Harpur Phillips (Appendices 7 and 8), also redacted.\n\n### 3. Main Content from the FOI Request Documents Relating to the FOI Request\n\nThe core of the released documents is Dr. Michael Turner's \"Report of Dr Michael Turner\" (the supplemental report), which details the methodology of a voter research survey.\n\n*   **Purpose of the Research:** To provide robust evidence regarding the impact of including a political party named \"The New Liberals\" in Australian Federal elections. Specifically, it aimed to answer:\n    *   If \"The New Liberals\" makes it harder for voters to correctly identify their intended political party.\n    *   If \"The New Liberals\" leads to confusion about its relationship with other registered political parties.\n*   **Research Design and Methodology:**\n    *   The study employed an online, computer-assisted, self-completion, text-based survey with an experimental design.\n    *   A significant sample size of n=2,036 Australian voters (aged 18+) eligible for Federal Elections was used.\n    *   Fieldwork was conducted from March 6-9, 2021.\n    *   **Experimental Ballot Papers:** Four different mock ballot paper designs were used to simulate varying prominence of \"The New Liberals\" relative to the Liberal Party:\n        *   **Ballot A (Control):** \"The New Liberals\" not displayed.\n        *   **Ballot B (Test):** \"The New Liberals\" displayed below the Liberal Party.\n        *   **Ballot C (Test):** \"The New Liberals\" displayed above the Liberal Party.\n        *   **Ballot D (Test):** \"The New Liberals\" displayed, but the Liberal Party not displayed.\n    *   **Questionnaire Design:** Carefully crafted with clear, plain language, closed questions. Key prevalence questions (like initial vote intention) were placed early to avoid bias, while attitudinal and clarifying questions were later. Question and response option orders were often randomised.\n    *   **Sample Selection & Weighting:** Participants were invited randomly from multi-source online panels, stratified by age-sex interlocking and state/territory based on ABS Census data. Post-fieldwork calibration weights were applied using targets from ABS statistics and 2019 Federal election results to ensure the sample was representative. The effective sample size after weighting was approximately n=1,863.\n    *   **Verification of Intent (Crucial for Confusion Assessment):** For respondents who initially selected \"The New Liberals,\" a follow-up question (Q24 in Appendix 2) was posed after providing factual information (e.g., leader, no connection to Liberal Party), asking them to confirm or correct their intended vote. This was a direct mechanism to measure if voters had misidentified the party due to the name.\n*   **Expert Opinion:** Dr. Turner, with extensive experience in social, political, and market research, concluded that the chosen methodology was optimal and appropriate for the project's objectives, aiming to provide robust and generalisable quantitative results regarding voter perception and potential confusion.\n*   **Redactions:** While the detailed methodology and questionnaire are provided, the actual findings and statistical results of the survey (in Appendix 6) are almost entirely redacted.\n\nProvide only the markdown formatted summary text. Do not include any conversational filler or preamble."
