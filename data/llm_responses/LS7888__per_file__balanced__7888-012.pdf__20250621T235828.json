The fifth page details a list of \"REDACTION CODES\" (numbered 1-28), outlining various categories of information that may have been redacted from other documents (e.g., Personal Information, Business information, Legal Professional Communication, Deliberative material, Irrelevant material).\n\n**Relevance to FOI Request LS7888:**\n\nThis document provides no substantive information directly related to FOI request LS7888's inquiries about the Australian Electoral Commission's (AEC) new methodology for its Indigenous Electoral Participation Program (IEPP). It does not contain details regarding the planning, implementation, outcomes, Indigenous involvement, or costs of the new methodology, nor does it provide data on enrolment rates or tracking efforts. Its content is purely administrative, serving as an introductory or explanatory piece regarding the FOI release process itself and the types of redactions applied to other released materials. Therefore, this specific document does not address any of the core questions posed by the FOI request."

  "prompt": "Considering this document as part of an FOI request, summarize the document and its relevance to the FOI request in markdown format. FYI the overview of the FOI request is: FOI request LS7888 sought documents from 2018-2019 concerning the Australian Electoral Commission's (AEC) new methodology for its Indigenous Electoral Participation Program (IEPP), specifically regarding its planning, implementation, outcomes, Indigenous involvement, and costs. The released documents reveal the AEC transitioned to a more direct method for estimating Indigenous electoral enrolment rates, primarily by utilising self-identified Indigeneity data from Centrelink. This shift, driven by the availability of new Centrelink data, significantly increased estimated Indigenous enrolment rates from approximately 58% (under the old 2014 methodology) to 76.4% by June 2018 and 76.6% by June 2019. The documents detail the new methodology, its impact, and efforts to track enrolment stimulation, including identifying over 72,000 potentially unenrolled Indigenous Australians in mid-2018 and subsequent enrolment events. However, the released content did not explicitly detail the number of Indigenous people involved in the methodology's development or its final costs and dedicated AEC staffing.\n\nDocument Text:\n\n\n\n--- Page 1 ---\n\nReleased under the Freedom of Information Act 1982\n\n\n--- Page 2 ---\n\nReleased under the Freedom of Information Act 1982\n\n\n--- Page 3 ---\n\nReleased under the Freedom of Information Act 1982\n\n\n--- Page 4 ---\n\nReleased under the Freedom of Information Act 1982\n\n\n--- Page 5 ---\n\nREDACTION CODES \n\nPersonal Information (name) redacted. \n\nPersonal Information (date of birth) redacted. \n\nPersonal Information (photograph) redacted \n\nPersonal Information (facsimile of signature) redacted. \n\nPersonal Information (facsimile of manuscript initialling) redacted. \n\nPersonal Information (Individual’s address) redacted. \n\nPersonal Information (individual’s telephone number) redacted. \n\nPersonal Information (individual’s opinion) redacted. \n\nPersonal Information (opinion about individual) redacted. \n\nPersonal Information (employment history) redacted. \n\nPersonal Information (qualifications) redacted. \n\nPersonal Information (health) redacted. \n\nPersonal Information (identifying individual) redacted. \n\nBusiness information (Bank Account details) redacted. \n\nBusiness information (Billing Account details) redacted. \n\nBusiness information (internal operations) redacted. \n\nLegal Professional Communication redacted. \n\nDeliberative material redacted. \n\nIrrelevant material redacted. \n\nElectoral Roll material redacted. \n\nTests, examinations or audits material redacted. \n\nManagement or assessment of personnel material redacted. \n\nProper and efficient conduct of the operations of AEC material redacted. \n\nLawful methods or procedures for preventing, detecting, investigating, or \ndealing with matters arising out of, breaches or evasions of the law. \n\nTrade Secrets. \n\nCommercial valuable information. \n\nFinancial interests of the Commonwealth. \n\nProperty interests of the Commonwealth. \n\n1 \n\n2 \n\n3 \n\n4 \n\n5 \n\n6 \n\n7 \n\n8 \n\n9 \n\n10 \n\n11 \n\n12 \n\n13 \n\n14 \n\n15 \n\n16 \n\n17 \n\n18 \n\n19 \n\n20 \n\n21 \n\n22 \n\n23 \n\n24 \n\n25 \n\n26 \n\n27 \n\n28\n\nProvide only the markdown formatted summary text.
