The released documents, comprising internal emails, analytical papers, and ministerial briefs, primarily detail the AEC's shift from an \"indirect estimation\" method (yielding a \"worst case\" 58% Indigenous enrolment rate) to a \"more direct method\" leveraging person-level Centrelink data available from 2017. This new approach, refined through an iterative process of data analysis and cleansing, resulted in significantly higher estimated national Indigenous enrolment rates of 76.4% as of June 2018 and 76.6% as of June 2019, and informed an enrolment stimulation event. However, the released documents did not provide specific details on the number of Indigenous people involved in the methodology's design and testing, nor did they contain information regarding the final cost of its implementation."

  "prompt": "Create a concise, single-paragraph summary in markdown format of the following FOI request summary:\n\nSummary:\n\n### Summary of FOI Request LS7888 Documents\n\nThis summary outlines the main purpose of the Freedom of Information (FOI) request, the types of documents released, and the key content of those documents pertaining to the request.\n\n#### Main Purpose of the FOI Request\n\nThe FOI request, identified as LS7888, sought documents from the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) relating to the design, testing, and implementation of its new methodology for the Indigenous Electoral Participation Program (IEPP) during 2018 and 2019. Specifically, the request aimed to obtain:\n*   Planning documentation for the new methodology, including any catalysts for its initiation (e.g., Ministerial instructions).\n*   Progress reports on the design, testing, and implementation, including internal communications.\n*   Documentation on how the implementation was tracked and comparisons with previous methodologies for assessing Indigenous enrolment rates.\n*   Final summary reports on the outcomes of the new methodology.\n*   Information on the number of Indigenous people involved in the planning, design, and implementation by the AEC.\n*   Details of the final cost of the design, testing, and implementation, including the number of AEC staff assigned.\n\n#### Documents from the FOI Request\n\nThe released documents comprise a schedule of 41 items, primarily consisting of internal AEC emails, minutes, and analytical papers. Several document entries in the schedule note that they are \"Subsumed\" by another document, indicating their content is incorporated elsewhere or is a part of a larger thread. The key types of documents are:\n*   **Email Correspondence:** Extensive internal email threads between various AEC staff members (e.g., Guy Lewis, Michael Roden, Angelo Rojas, Robyn Legg, Jeff Pope, Tita Tabije) discussing Indigenous data, enrolment rates, methodology, and parliamentary reviews.\n*   **Internal Papers/Analyses:** Documents titled \"Indigenous Franchise KPIs using Centrelink data\" and \"Analysis of Indigenous Enrolment,\" which detail the methodological approach, assumptions, and results.\n*   **Ministerial Briefs:** \"Estimates Brief â€“ Hot Issue\" prepared for the Special Minister of State, providing high-level summaries and key statistics on Indigenous enrolment rates.\n*   **Ministerial Submission:** An entry for a submission from the Electoral Commissioner to the Special Minister of State regarding the publication of Indigenous enrolment rates.\n\n#### Main Content from the FOI Request Documents\n\nThe documents primarily detail the AEC's shift in methodology for estimating Indigenous electoral enrolment and the resulting data.\n\n**1. Catalyst and Planning for the New Methodology:**\n*   The previous methodology (circa 2014) relied on an \"indirect estimation\" regression model, which yielded \"alarmingly low\" Indigenous enrolment rates (e.g., 58% nationally) that were considered a \"worst case picture.\"\n*   The \"catalyst\" for the new methodology was the availability of \"person-level Centrelink extracts\" that included a self-identified Indigenous indicator, starting in 2017. This provided the AEC with a \"very large number of enrolled persons... with an explicit Indigenous status.\"\n*   The new method is described as a \"more direct method of estimating the Indigenous enrolment rate,\" assumed to be an \"improved approach\" with a \"higher likelihood of robust results,\" though still regarded as \"indicative only\" due to necessary assumptions and inherent biases in Centrelink data and matching processes.\n\n**2. Design, Testing, and Implementation Tracking:**\n*   The new methodology involves:\n    1.  Calculating the raw enrolment rate of Centrelink clients with identified Indigenous/non-Indigenous status.\n    2.  Calculating an adjustment factor by comparing the actual AEC overall enrolment rate to the Centrelink-based rate.\n    3.  Applying this factor to the Centrelink-based Indigenous and non-Indigenous enrolment rates.\n*   The methodology was implemented annually as part of the AEC's Annual Roll Integrity Review (ARIR).\n*   Internal discussions reveal an iterative process of data analysis, cleansing, and refinement (e.g., identifying and addressing matching errors for older cohorts, resolving discrepancies in reported unenrolled figures).\n*   An \"enrolment stimulation event\" conducted in February/March 2019 used the Centrelink data to target \"potentially unenrolled Indigenous Australians.\" This event resulted in 2,646 Indigenous Australians enrolling.\n\n**3. Outcomes and Comparisons with Prior Methodologies:**\n*   The new methodology showed a significant increase in the estimated Indigenous enrolment rate compared to the previous 58%.\n*   As at **30 June 2018**, the estimated national Indigenous enrolment rate was **76.4%**. The estimated number of enrolled Indigenous Australians was 383,078, with 118,581 estimated as unenrolled.\n*   As at **30 June 2019**, the national estimated Indigenous enrolment rate slightly increased to **76.6%**, continuing an upward trend from 74.7% in 2017. The estimated unenrolled Indigenous population grew from 118,581 to 120,486 nationally (a 1.6% increase).\n*   State-level data was also tracked, showing varied performance. For instance, NSW saw a slight decrease in its Indigenous enrolment rate from 87.3% (2018) to 86.2% (2019), leading to an 10.9% increase in its estimated unenrolled Indigenous population. This was clarified as a \"not statistically significant\" decrease falling within estimation error, but still representing a notable absolute increase in unenrolled numbers for the largest state.\n*   Detailed tables show the distribution of enrolled and potentially unenrolled Indigenous Australians (identified via Centrelink data) by state and electoral division.\n\n**4. Indigenous Involvement and Costs:**\n*   The documents identify several AEC staff members involved in the design, analysis, and reporting of the new methodology. However, they **do not specify the number of these staff who are Indigenous** or explicitly detail the involvement of Indigenous people from outside the AEC in the methodology's design and testing.\n*   The released documents **do not contain any information regarding the final cost** of the design, testing, and implementation of the new methodology, nor do they detail the total number of AEC staffers assigned specifically to this task.\n\nProvide only the markdown formatted summary text. Do not include any conversational filler or preamble."
