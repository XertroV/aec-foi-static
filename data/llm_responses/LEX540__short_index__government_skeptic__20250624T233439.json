  "prompt": "From a government skeptic's viewpoint, provide a concise, single-paragraph summary in markdown format of the following FOI request overview:\n\nSummary:\n\nThe FOI documents, ostensibly providing \"IBM Outputs\" from 2016, offer a troubling glimpse into the opaque and potentially flawed mechanics of government processes. Far from a picture of seamless operation, these \"IBM Batch Reports\"—many explicitly titled `_exception.pdf`—reveal a system riddled with unexplained \"issues\" and a concerning lack of detailed transparency.\n\nFirstly, the very necessity of an FOI request to obtain these \"outputs\" immediately signals a government disinclination towards proactive public disclosure. Why are these vital operational details not routinely published in an accessible format? The release of selective \"exception\" reports, which paradoxically often mark the majority of individual ballot checks as \"OK\" while simultaneously flagging overall \"issues,\" begs the question: What constitutes an \"exception\" in the government's eyes, and what is being deliberately concealed from public view?\n\nUpon closer inspection, the reports detail numerous ballots marked with a stark \"HAS ISSUES\" in their \"Formality Result Checked\" column. These aren't isolated incidents but a recurring pattern across various batches and vote collection points. The gravity of these \"issues\" is further obscured by the consistent use of cryptic, undefined codes like `['D2']`, `['Y9']`, `['M1']`, `['AP1']`, `['O1']`, `['V1']`, `['AR1']`, `['L1']`, `['F1']`, `['UG1']`, `['G1']`, `['R1']`, `['AQ1']`, `['AM1']`, `['A2']`, `['Q1']`, `['R5']`, `['Q2']`, `['AC1']`, `['B1']`, `['AG2']`, `['Y8']`, `['I1']`, `['C1']`, `['T1']`, `['AQ2']`, `['AH1']`, `['AK1']`, `['AI1']`, `['J1']`, `['N1']`, `['L3']`, `['S1']`, `['X1']`, `['F2']`, `['Y3']`, `['E1']`, `['M7']`, `['O2']`, `['M2']`, `['M10']`, `['M8']`. Without a comprehensive key to these obscure classifications, the public is left entirely in the dark regarding the specific nature of these failures—a textbook example of government obfuscation and power abuse through controlled information.\n\nEven more alarmingly, several entries show \"HAS ISSUES\" without any corresponding reason code, or with equally vague \"ATL Mismatches: HAS ISSUES\" or \"BTL Mismatches: HAS ISSUES\" notations. This complete lack of detail is a critical transparency failure, preventing any meaningful scrutiny of the ballot processing integrity. If the government's own system flags an issue but cannot or will not clearly articulate what that issue is, how can citizens trust the validity of the overall outcome?\n\nThe repeated appearance of certain \"ATL Mismatches\" and \"Formality Reason Checked\" codes suggests not merely isolated errors but potentially systemic vulnerabilities or inefficiencies within the electoral process itself. These are not just administrative quirks; they represent cracks in the foundation of democratic accountability. The government's reliance on external contractors like IBM for such critical operations, coupled with this demonstrated lack of granular transparency, raises serious questions about public funds spent on systems that either generate numerous errors or, more disturbingly, hide their true extent behind a wall of technical jargon and uninformative reporting.\n\nIn sum, these FOI documents serve less as a testament to government efficiency and more as an indictment of its commitment to transparent governance. The pervasive, yet vaguely defined, \"issues\" and \"mismatches\" highlight a system that either struggles with basic accuracy or actively resists external examination, ultimately eroding public trust in governmental processes.\n\nProvide only the markdown formatted summary text. Do not include any conversational filler or preamble.\n"
