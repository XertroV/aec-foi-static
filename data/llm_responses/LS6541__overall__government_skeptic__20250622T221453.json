            "text": "The provided FOI document schedule, pertaining to the renaming of the Division of Corangamite to \"Cox,\" offers a minimalist view into internal government processes, highlighting a pervasive lack of transparency. While the request specifically sought communications regarding the name's appropriateness and potential for misinterpretation, the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) has only released a barebones schedule of email exchanges, entirely devoid of actual content.\n\nThis \"release\" effectively obscures the very discussions the FOI aimed to uncover. We see various AEC staff, including the National Redistributions Manager and Secretariat Officers, engaging in email threads about \"Other Corangamite names\" and later, specifically \"May Cox\" and related imagery. Crucially, the involvement of the Assistant Director, Media, in discussions about \"Picture – May Cox\" strongly suggests the AEC was acutely aware of, and preparing to manage, potential public relations fallout or ridicule stemming from the controversial \"Cox\" name.\n\nFrom a skeptical standpoint, this raises significant questions:\n1.  **Questionable Decision-Making**: The very nature of the FOI request implies public concern over the appropriateness of the name \"Cox.\" The AEC's decision to proceed with a name that evidently necessitated internal PR strategizing suggests a lack of foresight or a disregard for public sentiment and potential misinterpretation.\n2.  **Inefficiency and Waste**: The time and resources dedicated by multiple AEC staff, including senior management and media personnel, to seemingly manage the optics of a potentially ill-chosen name is an inefficient use of taxpayer funds. Had a less controversial name been selected, these resources could have been directed elsewhere, avoiding unnecessary administrative burden.\n3.  **Lack of Transparency**: The AEC's response provides the absolute minimum — a list of who emailed whom and about what subject, but no substance. This is not transparency; it's a superficial acknowledgment designed to give the impression of compliance without revealing any actual decision-making rationale or internal dissent. The public remains in the dark about how and why this potentially problematic name was chosen and what concerns, if any, were raised internally. The redaction of a mobile number, while standard, further contributes to the piecemeal, incomplete picture presented.\n\nIn essence, these documents, or rather what they conspicuously *don't* show, point to a government agency that may have made a questionable decision, then dedicated resources to manage the public perception of that decision, all while maintaining a tight grip on true transparency regarding its internal deliberations."
