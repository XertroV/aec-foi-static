            "text": "The document, \"AEC Procedures for Determining Breaches of the APS Code of Conduct and Sanctions,\" outlines the internal administrative steps taken by the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) to investigate alleged breaches of the Australian Public Service (APS) Code of Conduct and to impose corresponding sanctions on employees. It details who can make determinations, the procedural fairness requirements (such as informing the employee and allowing a statement), and how sanctions are applied. The document emphasizes principles like expedition, consistency with procedural fairness, and the independence/unbiased nature of decision-makers, while also specifying the formal recording of determinations and the handling of cases where an employee's engagement changes.\n\nWithin the context of the FOI request, this document serves as a foundational instrument for enforcing the very \"collectivist mandates\" that undermine individual rights. The FOI overview highlights the APS Code of Conduct as the vehicle for \"coerced 'political neutrality'\" and \"social media censorship,\" as well as \"forced conformity to state-defined 'values'.\" This AEC procedure document describes the bureaucratic mechanism by which these broad, state-defined \"values\" are imposed, monitored, and enforced through punitive measures, thus directly supporting the \"systematic erosion of personal freedom\" identified in the FOI request.\n\n**Analysis from an Objectivist Perspective:**\n\n1.  **Reason:**\n    *   **Contradiction:** From an Objectivist perspective, the document, by detailing the enforcement of the APS Code of Conduct, fundamentally contradicts the value of reason. Reason demands open inquiry, independent thought, and the free expression of ideas. The Code, as described in the FOI request, aims to suppress \"personal opinion\" and enforce \"political neutrality,\" which are antithetical to rational engagement and the marketplace of ideas. The procedures, while appearing to offer \"procedural fairness\" (e.g., providing information, allowing statements), do so within a framework that implicitly pre-judges certain expressions or behaviors as \"breaches,\" rather than fostering an environment where individuals can exercise independent rational judgment. The inability of a \"support person\" to \"speak or advocate\" (4.4) further limits an individual's ability to mount a full, reasoned defense.\n    *   **Limited Facade:** The references to \"procedural fairness\" and \"independent and unbiased\" decision-makers (5.1) present a superficial nod to rational process. However, if the underlying \"Code\" is irrational (e.g., demanding suppression of thought), then the \"fairness\" of its enforcement mechanism becomes a means to suppress rather than to uphold reason.\n\n2.  **Individualism:**\n    *   **Contradiction:** This document is a direct manifestation of collectivism over individualism. Its entire purpose is to enforce a collective standard of conduct (the APS Code) upon individuals, overriding their autonomy, personal values, and freedom of expression. The FOI request highlights \"coerced 'political neutrality',\" \"social media censorship... into employees' private lives,\" and \"violation of bodily autonomy\" (via vaccination mandates enforced through the Code). This document provides the disciplinary backbone for punishing individuals who do not conform to these state-defined collective norms.\n    *   The provision that a \"support person cannot speak or advocate\" (4.4) is a direct assault on an individual's right to robust representation and self-defense, further isolating the individual in the face of state authority. The potential for prolonged investigations (8.3) also subordinates the individual's career progression and personal plans to the collective bureaucratic process.\n\n3.  **Free Enterprise and Productive Achievement:**\n    *   **Contradiction/Suppression:** While not directly about economic enterprise, the document's existence and purpose create a climate hostile to productive achievement. The constant threat of investigation for \"breaches\" of a broad, censorious Code discourages \"independent thought, initiative, and genuine productivity\" (as noted in the FOI request). Instead, it fosters a culture of \"rigid adherence to rules\" and risk aversion.\n    *   The focus shifts from achieving valuable outcomes to navigating a complex bureaucratic rulebook to avoid penalties. The ability of the AEC to halt \"movements (including promotions)\" until an investigation is resolved (8.3) is a direct disincentive to career advancement and personal growth, tying an individual's professional trajectory to the state's disciplinary processes. Such an environment inhibits the entrepreneurial spirit and the pursuit of excellence characteristic of free enterprise.\n\n**Evidence of Specific Obstacles:**\n\n*   **Bureaucratic Obstacles:**\n    *   The entire document is a bureaucratic framework for disciplinary action, demonstrating the complex layers of state control.\n    *   The requirement for \"prior written consent\" from the Australian Public Service Commissioner (2.2 Note) for non-APS employees to act as decision-makers adds an unnecessary layer of inter-agency bureaucracy.\n    *   The explicit provision that \"Movements (including promotions) will not take effect until the matter is resolved\" (8.3) acts as a significant bureaucratic impediment, effectively freezing an individual's career progression until a process that \"must be carried out with as little formality, and with as much expedition, as a proper consideration of the matter allows\" (3.1) is completeâ€”a process whose length is ultimately at the discretion of the state agency.\n\n*   **Forced Altruism:**\n    *   While not explicitly stated within *this* document, the *enforcement* of a Code that demands \"political neutrality\" and suppresses personal opinion (as per the FOI request) compels individuals to subjugate their personal convictions, values, and self-interest to the state's dictates. The document is the mechanism through which this suppression, effectively a form of forced altruism (sacrificing one's mind/values for the perceived collective good of \"neutrality\"), is enforced via punitive sanctions (6.1).\n\n*   **Suppression of Productive Achievement:**\n    *   The threat of sanctions (6.1) and the explicit procedure for determining breaches based on a restrictive Code (as described in the FOI request) inherently suppress individual initiative and independent thought.\n    *   The ability to delay or halt career progression (\"movements... will not take effect until the matter is resolved\" - 8.3) due to ongoing investigations creates a disincentive for individuals to innovate, challenge norms, or express views that might be construed as \"breaches,\" leading to conformity rather than productive excellence. The focus shifts from achieving goals to avoiding missteps, stifling the dynamic energy essential for true productive achievement."

  "prompt": "From an Objectivist perspective, summarize this specific document within the context of the FOI request. Analyze how the document reflects or contradicts the values of reason, individualism, and free enterprise. Note any evidence of bureaucratic obstacles, forced altruism, or suppression of productive achievement.\n\nTo aid you, the overview of the FOI request is: [REQUEST OVERVIEW START] From an Objectivist perspective, the Australian Electoral Commission documents reveal a pervasive system that fundamentally undermines individual rights and stifles rational self-interest and productive achievement in the name of collectivist mandates. They expose a systematic erosion of personal freedom, notably through coerced \"political neutrality\" and social media censorship that extends into employees' private lives, a direct assault on freedom of speech and association. The imposition of COVID-19 vaccination as a \"condition of engagement\" is a clear violation of bodily autonomy, illustrating dangerous government overreach into personal medical decisions. Furthermore, the bureaucratic environment, characterized by forced conformity to state-defined \"values\" and intense surveillance, actively suppresses independent thought, initiative, and genuine productivity, replacing it with rigid adherence to rules and an expectation of reporting colleagues. This institutionalized censorship and control, from restricting public information access to mandating social engineering modules and prohibiting personal opinion, transforms the AEC into a bureaucratic leviathan that subordinates the individual to the collective, demonstrating the constant vigilance required to protect personal liberty from the encroaching power of the state and its inherent dangers to human flourishing.\n [REQUEST OVERVIEW END] \n\n--- MAIN DOCUMENT TEXT START ---\n\n\n\n--- Page 1 ---\n\nDate: December 2018 \n\nAEC Procedures for \nDetermining Breaches of \nthe APS Code of Conduct \nand Sanctions \n\nCorporate Services Branch\n\n\n--- Page 2 ---\n\nContents \nObjective ................................................................................................................................................. 2 \n\nDefinitions ............................................................................................................................................... 2 \n\nApplication .............................................................................................................................................. 2 \n\n1.

The Electoral Commissioner is an \n\"Agency Head\" for the purposes of the Act (paragraph 29(2)(b) of the \nCommonwealth Electoral Act 1918). \n\nApplication \n1. Application of the Procedures \n1.1  The Procedures apply in determining whether an APS employee, has breached the Code in \n\nsection 13 of the Act.  \n\n1.2    In these Procedures, unless the contrary intention appears, a reference to: \n\na)  an APS employee includes reference to a former APS employee who is suspected of \n\nhaving breached the Code while an employee in the AEC; and  \n\nb)  a breach of the Code by a person includes a reference to a person engaging in conduct \n\nset out in subsection 15(2A) of the Act in connection with their engagement as an APS \n\nemployee. \n\n1.3. In accordance with subsection 15(7) of the Act, these procedures are publicly available on the \n\nAECâ€™s website. \n\nNote:   The Procedures apply only in relation to a suspected breach of the Code by an APS employee \n\nin respect of which a determination is to be made. Not all suspected breaches of the Code \nmay need to be dealt with by way of a determination. In particular circumstances, another \nway of dealing with a suspected breach of the Code may be more appropriate. \n\nThese Procedures are not legislative instruments (see subsection 15(8) of the Act).  \n\n2\n\n\n--- Page 4 ---\n\nPrinciples   \n2       Who may determine a breach of the Code and impose a sanction \nNote: \n\n Clause 40 of the Australian Public Service Commissionerâ€™s Directions 2016 provides that where the \nconduct of an APS employee raises concerns that relate both to effective performance and possible \nbreaches of the Code, the Agency Head must, before making a decision to deal with a suspected \nbreach under the formal misconduct provisions (being these Procedures), have regard to any relevant \nstandards and guidance issued by the Australian Public Service Commissioner.  \n\nInvestigations of suspected misconduct by former employees can be undertaken, but sanctions cannot \nbe imposed on former employees. \n\n2.1 \n\nAs soon as practicable after a suspected breach of the Code has been identified, the \nElectoral Commissioner or the Deputy Electoral Commissioner may deal with a suspected \nbreach, in accordance with the Procedures, by: \n\na)  making a written determination whether the APS employee has breached the Code; or \n\nb)  selecting the person  to make a determination whether the APS employee has breached \n\nthe Code (the breach decision maker).  \n\nNote: \n\nThe Australian Public Service Commissionerâ€™s prior written consent is required if a non APS \nemployee will be selected as the breach decision maker / sanction delegate (subsection 78(8) \nof the Act).  \n\nAn internal or external investigator may be appointed by the breach decision maker to \ninvestigate the alleged breach, gather evidence and present a report of factual findings, \nincluding recommendations.  \n\nThe person making the decision on the sanction must hold a delegation under the Act to do \nso (the sanction delegate). \n\nNote: These Procedures do not prevent the breach decision maker from being the sanction decision \nmaker in the same matter. \n\nSubject to clause 2.3 above, these procedures do not prevent the breach decision maker \nfrom being the sanction delegate in the same matter. \n\nThe Australian Public Service Commission publication â€˜Handling Misconduct Managers Guide \nâ€™, is a recommended resource available to the Breach Decision Maker and Sanction Delegate, \nto support them in making the determination and sanction decision.  \n\nDetermination process \nThe process for determining whether an APS employee has breached the Code must be \ncarried out with as little formality, and with as much expedition, as a proper consideration of \nthe matter allows. \n\nThe process must be consistent with the principles of procedural fairness. \n\nA formal hearing is not required in order for a person to determine whether an APS \nemployee has breached the Code. \n\nInformation to be given to employee before a determination is made \nA determination may not be made in relation to a suspected breach of the Code by an APS \nemployee unless reasonable steps have been taken to inform the employee of: \n\n2.2 \n\n2.3 \n\n2.4 \n\n2.5 \n\n3 \n3.1 \n\n3.2 \n\n3.3 \n\n4 \n4.1 \n\n3\n\n\n--- Page 5 ---\n\na)  the details of the suspected breach of the Code including any variation of those details; \n\nand \n\nb)  the sanctions that may be imposed on the employee under subsection 15(1) of the Act. \n\n4.2 \n\nA person who is making a determination in relation to a suspected breach of the Code by an \nAPS employee must give that employee a reasonable opportunity to make an oral and/or \nwritten statement, in relation to the suspected breach.  This statement may be made to the \nBreach Decision Maker or to the appointed investigator: \n\na)  within seven days of the APS employee being informed of the details (or any variation of \n\nthose details) of the suspected breach; or \n\nb)  such longer period as is allowed.  \n\n4.3 \n\n4.4 \n\n5 \n\n5.1 \n\n5.2 \n\n6 \n6.1 \n\n6.2 \n\n6.3 \n\n6.4 \n\nAn APS employee who does not make a statement in relation to the suspected breach is not, \nonly for that reason, to be taken to have admitted committing the suspected breach. \n\nThe breach decision maker or the investigator may agree to a request made by the APS \nemployee who is suspected of breaching the Code to have a support person present in a \nmeeting or interview they conduct.  The support person cannot speak or advocate on the \nemployees behalf. \n\nPersons involved in making a determination or imposing a sanction to be \nindependent and unbiased \nThe breach decision maker, any investigator assisting the breach decision maker and the \nsanction delegate must be, and must appear to be, independent and unbiased. \n\nA person must not determine whether an APS employee has breached the Code if the \nperson has previously made a report in relation to all or any matter suspected of \nconstituting the breach by the employee. \n\nSanctions \nIf a determination is made that an APS employee has breached the Code, the APS employee \nmay be subject to the imposition of a sanction under section 15 of the Act. \n\nSanctions are intended to be proportionate to the nature of the breach, and provide a clear \nmessage to the relevant employee that their behaviour was unacceptable. \n\nThe process for deciding on sanction must be consistent with the principles of procedural \nfairness. \n\nIf a determination is made that an APS employee has breached the Code, a sanction may not \nbe imposed on the employee unless reasonable steps have been taken to: \n\na) \n\ninform the APS employee of: \n\ni. \n\nii. \n\niii. \n\nthe determination that has been made; \n\nthe sanction or sanctions that are under consideration; and \n\nthe factors that are under consideration in determining any sanction to be \n\nimposed; and \n\n4\n\n\n--- Page 6 ---\n\nb)  give the APS employee a reasonable opportunity to make a written statement in relation \n\nto the sanction or sanctions under consideration within 7 calendar days, or any longer \n\nperiod that is allowed by the sanction delegate. \n\nNote:   The sanction delegate may decide to give the employee the opportunity to make both a \n\nwritten and an oral statement. \n\n7 \n7.1 \n\nRecord of determination and sanction \nIf a determination is made in relation to a suspected breach of the Code by an APS \nemployee, a written record must be made of: \n\na)  the suspected breach; and  \n\nb)  the determination; and  \n\nc)  any sanctions imposed as a result of a determination that the employee breached the \n\nCode; and \n\nd)  if a statement of reasons was given to the employee â€“ the statement of reasons.  \n\nNote:   The Archives Act 1983 and the Privacy Act 1988 apply to a record made under this clause. \n\n8 \n8.1 \n\nProcedures where basis of engagement in the AEC changes or ends \nThis clause applies where an APS employee is suspected of having breached the Code and a \ndetermination has not been made in relation to the suspected breach before: \n\na)  the basis of the employee's engagement in the AEC changes; or \n\nb)  the employee moves to another Agency, \n\nNote:   Examples of a change in the basis of an APS employee's engagement in an Agency are as follows: \n\na)  a change from engagement for a specified term, or for the duration of a specified task, to \n\nengagement as an ongoing APS employee; \n\nb)  a change from engagement for duties that are irregular or intermittent to engagement as an \n\nongoing APS employee. \n\n8.2 \n\nIf the basis of the APS employee's engagement in the AEC has changed before a \ndetermination is made in relation to the suspected breach, the determination must be made \nin accordance with the procedures applicable to the basis of the employee's engagement in \nthe AEC at the time the process for determining whether the employee has breached the \nCode is commenced. \n\n8.3 \n\nMovements (including promotions) will not take effect until the matter is resolved, unless \nboth Agency Heads agree otherwise. \n\nNote: The matter is taken to be resolved when: \n\na)  a determination is made; or \n\nb) \n\nit is decided that a determination is not necessary. \n\nLegislation \n\nâ–   Archives Act 1983 (Cth), < http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Series/C2004A02796 > \n\nâ–   Privacy Act 1988 (Cth), < http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Series/C2004A03712 > \n\n5\n\n\n--- Page 7 ---\n\nâ–   Public Service Act 1999 (Cth), < http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Series/C2004A00538 > \n\nâ–   Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Act 2013 (Cth), \n\n< http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Series/C2013A00123 > \n\nâ–   Public Governance, Performance and Accountability (Consequential and Transitional \n\nProvisions) Act 2014 (Cth), < http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Series/C2014A00062 > \n\nReferences \n\nâ€¢  Australian Public Service Commission publication â€˜Handling Misconduct: a human resource \n\nmanagers guideâ€™ \n\nContact  \nPeople, Performance and Integrity team, \nCorporate Services Branch \n\n6\n\n\n--- Page 8 ---\n\nVersion Control \n\nVersion \n\nLast review date \n\nAction \n\nNext review date \n\nOwner \n\nApproved by \n\n1.0 \n\n18/08/2014 \n\nConversion to PSB \nPolicy Format \n\n19/08/2015 \n\n1.1 \n\nDecember 2016 \n\nNovember 2017 \n\n1.2 \n\n1.3 \n\nDecember 2018 \n\nReview in line with \nBranch policy review \nfor EA 16-19 and \nPSCD16 \n\nChange references \nto PSB to reflect CSB \nâ€“ Insert unchanged \npolicy to new AEC \nPolicy template \nformat \n\nReview and changes \nto clarify procedural \nrequirements and \ninclude updates \nfrom APSC \nPublications \n\nDecember 2017 \n\nNovember 2018 \n\nPerformance \nManagement, \nPSB \n\nTom Rogers, A/g \nElectoral \nCommissioner \n\nPerformance \nand Conduct \nTeam \n\nAssistant Director, \nPerformance and \nConduct Team \n\nDirector, People \nSecurity and \nIntegrity \n\nAssistant \nCommissioner â€“ \nCorporate Services \nBranch \n\nNovember 2019 \n\nDirector People, \nSecurity and \nIntegrity \n\nFirst Assistant \nCommissioner - \nCapability \n\n7\n\nProvide only the markdown formatted summary text.
