            "text": "This document immediately raises red flags for a government skeptic, confirming several alarming aspects of the AEC's \"designated elector\" scheme outlined in the FOI overview.\n\nFirstly, the AEC's refusal to provide granular data for items 1, 1a, and 1b (\"No document response as per decision letter\") on the number of designated electors by state/territory and electoral division is a blatant act of **data evasion and deliberate opacity**. This intentional withholding of specific information prevents any meaningful public or independent scrutiny of the scheme's actual scale and geographic distribution, directly hindering accountability. While aggregated numbers are provided from their website, the refusal of detailed breakdowns suggests the AEC has something to hide regarding where and how extensively these designations are applied.\n\nSecondly, the provided figures for declarations made in recent financial years reveal a deeply concerning trend and a **decentralization of power**. The drastic increase from 1 declaration in 2023/24 to **211 in 2024/25** confirms the \"alarming 211-fold increase\" and points to a significant, unscrutinized expansion of this classification. Even more critically, the document explicitly states that \"Each declaration captured in response to item (2) was made by a delegate of the Electoral Commissioner.\" This confirms that the power to make these significant designations has been **exclusively delegated**, effectively allowing lower-level officials to classify citizens without direct oversight from the Commissioner, creating a system ripe for **overreach and a lack of direct accountability** at the top.\n\nFinally, the document exposes the **rubber-stamp nature of the internal review process and the complete absence of external scrutiny**. Out of 8 internal review applications over three years (a strikingly low number given the increasing designations), 7 were \"confirmed\" by the AEC's internal processes, with only 1 \"set aside.\" This paltry success rate for appeals demonstrates that the internal review is a bureaucratic formality designed to uphold the original decision rather than provide genuine redress. The most damning revelation, however, is the **zero applications for review to the Administrative Review Tribunal** and, crucially, **zero declarations ceasing to have effect** by virtue of s 202AH(3) in the reported financial years. This confirms the scheme creates a **permanent, unchallenged government classification** with no natural expiry, effectively trapping individuals in a potentially arbitrary designation. This absolute lack of external oversight and the perpetual nature of these classifications highlight a severe erosion of due process and an open invitation for potential abuse of power by an unaccountable bureaucracy."

  "prompt": "From a government skeptic's viewpoint, summarize this specific document within the context of the FOI request. Look for evidence of bureaucracy, lack of accountability, or any hidden agendas. The overall FOI overview is: The FOI documents expose a disturbing lack of accountability within the AEC's \"designated elector\" scheme, revealing a deliberate opacity regarding its scale and distribution through data evasion. The alarming 211-fold increase in designations, exclusively by delegates rather than the Commissioner, signals a concerning decentralization of power prone to overreach. Furthermore, the internal review process acts as a rubber stamp, completely lacking external scrutiny or natural expiry for designations, effectively creating a permanent, unchallenged government classification that erodes due process and invites potential abuse of power.\n\nDocument Text:\n\n\n\n--- Page 1 ---\n\nLEX7939  \n\nFOI Request LEX7939 â€“ Designated Electors Data  \n\nI seek access to the following, as at the close of rolls 7 April 2025: \n\n1.
