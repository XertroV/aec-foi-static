            "text": "The release of these FOI documents reveals a concerning lack of transparency and an institutional reluctance to address internal ethical concerns directly.\n\n**Pervasive Redaction Hides Internal Discussions:**\nThe most striking finding is the extensive redaction of the \"Transcript of 2023 Town Hall.\" Out of 26 pages of the transcript, 18 pages are almost entirely blacked out under \"Section 22.\" This \"release in part\" is a nominal concession that effectively conceals the vast majority of internal discussions and updates from public scrutiny. For an \"agency-wide update\" meeting, such extreme censorship suggests a deliberate effort to shield information, potentially hiding inefficiencies, controversial decisions, or sensitive internal matters from public view. This practice severely undermines transparency and accountability.\n\n**Staff Voice Alarm on Ethics, Citing Robodebt:**\nDespite the heavy redactions, the unredacted \"Transcript of Questions\" reveals significant internal anxiety among staff regarding ethical conduct. Employees explicitly referenced the catastrophic \"Robodebt\" scandal, calling for an \"independent ethics adviser, not an AEC SES.\" This demand strongly suggests a lack of trust in existing internal ethical oversight mechanisms and a perceived need for impartial guidance outside the influence of the AEC's senior executive. The high number of upvotes on these questions (5 and 8) indicates a widespread concern across the agency.\n\n**Government's Deflection and Dismissal of Internal Concerns:**\nThe government's response to these critical staff concerns appears dismissive and deflective. While acknowledging Robodebt as \"terrible,\" the AEC Commissioner, Tom Rogers, defensively asserted that he had \"never seen anything like that\" within the AEC's 30-40 year history, downplaying the potential for similar issues. Instead of addressing the core request for an *internal, independent* ethics adviser, staff were redirected to external bodies like the Australian Public Service Commission (APSC) or simply reminded of existing internal channels. This response avoids taking proactive steps to build greater internal trust or strengthen ethical oversight within the AEC itself, suggesting an unwillingness to genuinely address underlying structural or trust deficits perceived by employees.\n\nIn summary, these documents paint a picture of a government agency prioritizing secrecy over transparency, and deflecting genuine internal concerns about ethical integrity rather than implementing meaningful independent oversight. The widespread redactions represent a deliberate barrier to public scrutiny, while the responses to employee fears about a \"Robodebt\"-like scenario demonstrate a concerning institutional complacency."

Uh, I'm Tom Rogers. For those that haven't met me, and I know we've got a number \nof new staff and I'm the electoral commissioner. Let me welcome you to this Town Hall and to start \nthat I'd like to \n\n0:25 \nbegin by acknowledging the traditional custodians of the country throughout Australia and pay my \nrespects to the elders past and present. So welcome. \n\n0:35 \nThese town halls have proven to be very popular. It's a great way of us being able to give you an \nagency wide update of what's occurring, but also importantly to give you the opportunity to ask any \nquestions that you might have of any of the executive \n\n0:48 \nfor those that have been on these town halls before, you'll know the format. Each of us, each member \nof the executive is going to talk for a bit about what we're doing or issues that we think you might be \ninterested in. \n\n1:01 \nAnd at the same time, we'll have time for questions. So just to remind people, you can ask questions \nin a couple of different ways. You can wait till the end of everyone talking or if you've got a question \non the way through, please ask it in the chat function, in the Q&A function. We'll do everything we \npossibly can to answer those questions. We've got a good track record of answering all of those \nquestions. If we can't just because of time or it's too long, we'll take it on notice and come back to \nyou. We'll either respond \n\n1:31 \nand writing or I'll get one of the executive team to jump on and actually answer the question \npersonally where we can.

Could we have an \nreply from Moderator \nindependent ethics adviser, not an AEC SES, so if we need to consult someone we can. \nModerator \n11/15/2023 2:46 PM \n\nThat is an interesting perspective. Firstly I would say what occurred in Robodebt is \nterrible and I have not seen any of that sort of behaviour, or anything close to it, in the \nAEC in my 10 years here. If you are looking for something independent I would suggest \nthe Australian Public Service Commission but there are many ways to seek advise in the \nQuestion from anonymous user \npublic service or to escalate concerns, including anonymously. Thanks, Jeff \nAnonymous \n11/15/2023 2:39 PM \n\n8\nThis is a comment in relation to a previous question about impartial ethics advice - the \nAPSC has an Ethics Advisory Service https://www.apsc.gov.au/working-\nreply from Moderator \naps/integrity/ethics-advisory-service \nModerator \n11/15/2023 2:47 PM \n\nThanks for the comment. Following the findings of Robodebt the APS will be doing more \nwork around this. You'll also see on the APSC website that there are a range of avenues \nopen to raise concerns, including line managers harassment contact officers yees for \ndealing with concerns, central conduct or integrity units nominated individuals or \nteams in HR, including employee advice units or hotlines, or fraud prevention and \ncontrol units or hotlines email reporting addresses ‘authorised officers’ who receive \npublic interest disclosures.\n\nProvide only the markdown formatted summary text.
