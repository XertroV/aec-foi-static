            "text": "The released FOI documents reveal a concerning lack of transparency and a narrow, potentially evasive response to a request concerning crucial aspects of electoral integrity.\n\nDespite the FOI request explicitly seeking information on the \"integrity, accuracy, and legality of the AEC's counting algorithms (especially in light of LEX3029)\" and the \"physical security of AEC's election-related operations\" across a six-month period, only one set of meeting minutes was released. These minutes, from a single meeting on March 29, 2022, solely detail the administrative process of upholding the deregistration of the 'Australian People’s Party' due to insufficient membership.\n\nThis highly selective disclosure strongly suggests that critical discussions regarding the integrity of vote-counting algorithms (specifically \"LEX3029\") and the physical security of election operations are either not being formally documented in an accessible manner, or such documentation is being deliberately withheld. The government's response effectively sidesteps the most substantive and potentially scrutinizable aspects of the FOI request, opting instead to release information pertaining to a minor administrative function. This indicates a potential pattern of opaqueness regarding sensitive electoral processes and raises questions about the prioritization of bureaucratic compliance over comprehensive transparency on issues of fundamental public concern. The complete absence of any discussion on \"LEX3029\" is particularly glaring, implying a reluctance to subject crucial algorithmic processes to public scrutiny."
