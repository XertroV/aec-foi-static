            "text": "The document consists of internal Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) email correspondence from September 2022, primarily discussing the time, cost, and resource implications of its political party membership testing methodology. It also includes numerous pages of what appear to be statistical data or parameters (pages 7-35) and pages redacted under Legal Professional Privilege (s 42 LPP) (pages 1-2, 36-37).\n\n**Summary of Document Content:**\n\n*   **Current Membership Testing Methodology:** The AEC's current methodology for lists of 1,500-1,650 members involves a sample size of less than 60. An average test takes approximately two weeks from instruction to result. It requires about 21 hours of Commonwealth employee time (6 hours for member contact, 15 hours for data cleaning and matching to the Electoral Roll), costing roughly AU$1,082 for in-house testing. Services Australia's testing is covered by an annual lump sum agreement.\n*   **Feasibility of Larger Sample Sizes:** The AEC considered the impact of testing a larger sample size, specifically 564 members (a sample size potentially applicable for lists over 4,000, like VOTEFLUX.ORG's larger submission). Such a test would:\n    *   Increase the cost to approximately AU$10,153 per test in Commonwealth employee time.\n    *   Require a significant increase in staffing (5-10 staff working concurrently) and substantial restructuring of the Party Registration Team.\n    *   Pose risks related to managing responses, duplications, and ensuring accuracy due to splitting the work.\n    *   Raise concerns about setting a precedent that could strain AEC resources and undermine the \"endorsed methodology\" by creating opportunities for deregistered parties to challenge established processes with excessively large membership lists.\n*   **Statistical Data:** Pages 7-35 appear to contain columns of numerical data, likely representing statistical inputs, outputs, or detailed results related to membership testing, such as sample sizes, percentages, and confidence intervals, consistent with a statistical testing methodology.\n*   **Redactions:** Sections redacted for Legal Professional Privilege (s 42 LPP) indicate that the document contains sensitive legal advice pertinent to the AEC's operational procedures and decisions regarding party registration.\n\n**Relevance to the FOI Request:**\n\nThis document is highly relevant to the FOI request concerning VOTEFLUX.ORG's deregistration. It directly addresses the AEC's internal considerations regarding its membership testing methodology, particularly its **resource constraints** and the rationale behind adhering to an **established, endorsed methodology**.\n\nThe FOI request overview states that VFUD's deregistration was upheld based on the failure of its *first* membership test and its subsequent failure to provide a \"properly testable list within the AEC's established, resource-constrained methodology,\" despite a procedural error in testing its *second, larger* 4,680-member list.\n\nThis document explicitly supports the AEC's position by demonstrating:\n\n1.  **Cost and Resource Strain:** Testing a significantly larger sample, as would be required for a list of over 4,000 members (like VFUD's second list), would incur a tenfold increase in cost and demand a substantial, impractical reallocation of internal AEC staffing and resources.\n2.  **Adherence to Endorsed Methodology:** The document emphasizes the AEC's commitment to its \"endorsed methodology\" and expresses concerns that deviating from it to accommodate excessively large lists could set an \"unnecessary strain on resources\" and create a \"precedent in which the AEC (or the Electoral Commission) will test membership lists of any size, despite there being an endorsed methodology.\"\n3.  **Protection against Challenges:** The AEC acknowledges the risk of providing \"an opportunity for deregistered parties to challenge established processes\" if it were to test unusually large lists outside its standard methodology, reinforcing the decision to uphold deregistration based on current, robust processes.\n\nIn essence, the document reveals the internal cost-benefit analysis and strategic concerns that underpinned the AEC's decision to maintain its existing testing framework, even when faced with larger, non-compliant lists, thereby validating the \"resource-constrained methodology\" cited in the FOI request overview."

Do not include any conversational filler or preamble.To aid you, the overview of the FOI request is: [REQUEST OVERVIEW START] The FOI request concerned the deregistration of the political party VOTEFLUX.ORG | Upgrade Democracy! (VFUD) by the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) for failing to meet the mandatory 1,500-member threshold. This decision stemmed from VFUD's submitted membership lists failing the AEC's statistical testing methodology, which the party contended was fundamentally flawed, particularly after a procedural error saw the delegate non-randomly test only 1,650 names from a larger 4,680-member list. During the subsequent internal review, the AEC Commission affirmed the deregistration, critically acknowledging that the delegate's non-random testing of the second list was a \"departure from the methodology\" and placed \"no weight\" on its results. However, the deregistration was upheld based on the definitive failure of VFUD's *first* membership test and the party's subsequent failure to provide a properly testable list within the AEC's established, resource-constrained methodology.\n [REQUEST OVERVIEW END] \n\n--- MAIN DOCUMENT TEXT START ---\n\n\n\n--- Page 1 ---\n\ns 42 (LPP)\n\n\n--- Page 2 ---\n\ns 42 (LPP)\n\n\n--- Page 3

I’ve slightly updated our\nquestion 3 below in light of ABS response at 2(a) of their letter. As you’ll see the ABS considers that\nthe current testing methodology continues to be appropriate, provided that the Commission is\nsatisfied that it is reasonable to require a political party to provide a list of between 1,500 to 1,650\nmembers. As we noted below, the Commission has orally advised the Commission Secretariat that\nthey would also like to seek advice from the AEC, and to the extent necessary, Services Australia in\nrelation to the likely cost of various options for membership testing.  \n\nKind regards\n\n | Senior Government Lawyer\nLegal Services Section | Legal & Procurement Branch\nAustralian Electoral Commission\n\nFrom: Commission Secretariat \nSent: Tuesday, 30 August 2022 11:36 AM\nTo: \n\ns 47F (Personal Privs 47F (Personal Privacy)s 47F (Personal Privacy)s 47F (Pe s 47F (Pe s 47F (Personal Privacy)s 47F (Personal Privacy)s 47F (Personal Privacy)s 47F (Personal Privacy) 47F (Personal s 47F (Personal Privacy)s 47F (Pe s 47F (Personal Privacy)s 47F (Personal Privacy)s 47F (Personal Privacy)s 47F - Pe\n\n\n--- Page 39 ---\n\nCc: FAD <FAD@aec.gov.au>; \n\nSubject: voteflux.org - Request for advice from Party Registration Team/Services Australia (LEX1991)\n[SEC=OFFICIAL]\n\nDear \n\nOn 23 August 2022 the Electoral Commissioner wrote to Dr Gruen AO at the ABS to ask a number of\nquestions about the testing methodology currently employed by the AEC. Please see attached a copy\nof that correspondence.\n\nAs you will see, in that letter the Electoral Commission requested formal ABS advice in relation to\noptions for testing party membership. ABS have not yet responded to the letter, but the Commission\nhas orally advised the Commission Secretariat that they would also like to seek advice from the AEC,\nand to the extent necessary, Services Australia in relation to the likely cost of various options for\nmembership testing.\n\nWe understand that the AEC has an agreement with Services Australia for Services Australia to\nundertake membership testing. However, the AEC Party Registration Team also has capacity to\nundertake some membership testing ‘in-house’.\n\nWhilst that advice may depend on the response from ABS, and whilst the Commission may write with\nfurther questions, we would be grateful at this stage if you could prepare initial advice responding to\nthe following questions.\n\n1.  On the basis of the current methodology (noting the sample size would be less than 60\n\nmembers for a list of between 1500-1650 members), what is the average amount of time that\nperforming a membership test takes?\n\na.  How long does it usually take from the AEC providing instructions to undertake testing\n\nuntil a result is provided?\n                                                               i.      Approximately 2 weeks.\n\nb.  Roughly how many hours of Commonwealth employees’ time does testing take?\n\n                                                               i.      Contacting members takes approximately 6 hours.\n                                                             ii.      Data cleaning of the membership list and matching the list to the\n\nCommonwealth Electoral Roll takes approximately 15 hours.\n\n2.  What is the average cost of performing a membership test with the current methodology when\n\ntesting undertaken by Services Australia or by the AEC?\n\n                                                               i.      Current inhouse staffing arrangements would have an APS5 undertake\n\nmembership testing. An APS 5’s hourly rate is $51.54 (incl Leave, Long Service\nLeave and Superannuation). Using the assumption that it requires 21 hours\nfor end-to-end testing of the membership list, it would costs the\nCommonwealth $1,082 of a Commonwealth Employee’s time.\n\n                                                             ii.      In regards to Services Australia, my understanding is that the AEC has paid\nfor Services Australia’s services for a one year period in which any number of\nmembership lists can be tested.\n\n3.  Noting that the current methodology requires a sample size of less than 60 members, can you\n\nprovide an estimate of how long it would take and how much it would cost to test a list\nassuming a sample size of 564 members?\n\n                                                               i.      Using the same set of assumptions above, and noting to do this this in a\n\ntimely manner, 5 to 10 staff members would need to work on the list\nconcurrently, it would take:\n\ns 47F (Personal Privacy)s 47F (Personal Privacy)s 47F (Pe\n\n\n--- Page 40 ---\n\n1.  Approximately 2 to 3 weeks for end-end-testing: 56 hours to contact\n\nmembers; and 141 hours to undertake data cleaning and matching of the\nlist to the Commonwealth Electoral Roll (using 9.4 multiplier, which is the\nmultiplier I used to calculate time of testing a list of 60 vs 564). Using the\nAPS5 multiplier of $51.54 it would cost $10,153 of a Commonwealth\nEmployee’s time.\n\n                                                             ii.      There are a number of considerations and risks should the agency choose\n\nto increase the size of testing to (for example) a list of 564 members. This\nincludes:\n1.  A list of 564 members would not be possible for the current Party\n\nRegistration Team staffing arrangement to undertake without substantial\nchanges to the team’s structure – the list is simply too large for it to be\nmanageable.\n\n2.  The most efficient way to manage a list this size would be to split it\n\namongst 5 to 10 staff. This poses a number of risks including:\n\na.  Mis-managing member responses\nb.  Duplications\nc.  Ensuring accuracy in the membership results.\n\n3.  Under current arrangements, splitting a list between 5 to 10 staff would\ninvolve further engagement with Services Australia and a possible split of\nwork between AEC and Services Australia staff. In theory, by splitting the\nlist between 5 to 10 people, the membership testing could be completed\nwithin 2-3 weeks.\n\n4.  The size of such a membership list however would be a substantial increase\nin work at the first part of the process in which members are matched to\nelectors on the Commonwealth Electoral Roll (which is done by the AEC), it\nis probable that the Party Registration Team would need to increase\nstaffing numbers, or engage other areas of the AEC to assist.\n\n5.  Further concerns testing a size this large could create a precedent in which\nthe AEC (or the Electoral Commission) will test membership lists of any\nsize, despite there being an endorsed methodology. Should the Electoral\nCommission wish to test a list of that size, we may need to consider an\nentirely new membership testing methodology and ensure that the process\nis fair, robust and not providing an opportunity for deregistered parties to\nchallenge established processes. Furthermore, if the AEC tests a list of over\n4,000 members, what’s to stop a party submitting a list of 10,000 or more\nmembers? Lists of this size would put an unnecessary strain on resources\nand is not consistent with the endorsed methodology. \n\nYou will note that the third question proceeds from the assumption of testing a list of over 4,000\nmembers based on the sample size suggested by the ABS calculator using the existing parameters for\nrisk of false acceptance and rejection.\n\nThank you for your assistance.\n\n | Commission Secretariat\n\nAustralian Electoral Commission\n\ns 47F (Personal Privacy)s 47F (Personal Privacy)\n\n"
