            "text": "# Summary of FOI Request LS7759 Documents: 'Stop Selling Australia' Party Registration\n\n## Main Purpose of the FOI Request\nThe FOI request (LS7759) sought documents related to the attempted registration of the 'Stop Selling Australia' party, specifically focusing on the \"member checking phase.\" The requester aimed to obtain:\n*   Email responses from each person contacted during membership testing.\n*   Any notes or recordings from responses received via phone calls.\n\n## Documents from the FOI Request\nThe released documents include:\n*   **Document 1:** Extract of AEC website information on ABS's method for testing political party membership.\n*   **Document 2:** The completed application form for 'Stop Selling Australia' party registration (5/09/2018).\n*   **Document 5:** Email chain regarding membership testing results and updated membership lists (23/01/2019).\n*   **Document 9 & 14:** Emails from Roll Management Section (RMANS) to Parliamentary and Party Registration Section (PPRS) detailing results of matching the membership list against the electoral roll (24/01/2019 & 28/02/2019).\n*   **Document 10:** The membership list of the 'Stop Selling Australia' party after electoral roll checking (24/01/2019).\n*   **Document 20:** Mail merge document with emails sent to a random sample of party members for testing (04/03/2019).\n*   **Document 21:** Email chain showing one person's response to membership testing, including a subsequent phone call confirming denial (20/03/2019).\n*   **Document 22:** Compiled email responses from membership testing (04/03/2019-16/03/2019).\n*   **Document 23 & 24:** Tables summarizing and breaking down the results of membership testing (04/03/2019-20/03/2019 & 20/03/2019).\n*   **Document 25:** Internal Minute to the delegate recommending refusal of the application in its current form under s 131 of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 (21/03/2019).\n*   **Document 26:** Notice sent to the registered officer of the 'Stop Selling Australia' party under s 131 of the Electoral Act (29/03/2019).\n*   **Document 27 & 28:** Notices regarding suspension and recommencement of application processing due to the 2019 federal election (12/04/2019 & 24/06/2019).\n\n## Main Content Related to the FOI Request\nThe documents detail the Australian Electoral Commission's (AEC) process of assessing the 'Stop Selling Australia' party's application for registration, specifically focusing on its compliance with the requirement of having at least 500 members who are on the Commonwealth Electoral Roll.\n\n1.  **Application and Membership List:** The 'Stop Selling Australia' party submitted an application for registration, including a membership list. After initial checks and subsequent updates provided by the party, a list of 550 members was processed.\n2.  **Electoral Roll Matching:** The AEC's Roll Management Section (RMANS) conducted checks against the electoral roll.\n    *   An email dated 24 January 2019 showed 406 members matched, 133 had no match, and 11 had multiple matches out of 550.\n    *   A later email dated 28 February 2019 indicated 404 matched, 135 no match, and 11 multiple matches.\n    *   Ultimately, after manual identification efforts, **503 members were identified as being on the electoral roll**.\n3.  **Membership Testing (Direct Contact):** To verify the membership, the AEC conducted a random sample test.\n    *   Based on ABS methodology, a sample size of **26 members** was required for direct contact, with a maximum of **1 denial** of membership permitted for the party to pass.\n    *   The AEC attempted to contact **52 members** in total, as some were uncontactable. Emails (Document 22) were sent to individuals requesting confirmation of membership.\n    *   Document 21 highlights a critical case: one individual initially provided a seemingly neutral email response, but a subsequent phone call (as per the FOI request's interest in phone responses) revealed they **denied being a member** of 'Stop Selling Australia'.\n4.  **Results and Outcome:**\n    *   Out of the contacted sample, **24 members confirmed** their membership.\n    *   However, **2 members denied** their membership, exceeding the permitted single denial.\n    *   **Therefore, the 'Stop Selling Australia' party's application \"FAILED\" the membership testing assessment.**\n5.  **AEC Decision:** As detailed in Document 25 (Minute to delegate) and Document 26 (s 131 Notice), the AEC determined that the application, in its current form, did not satisfy the requirements of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918, primarily due to failing the membership test. The AEC issued a notice under subsection 131(1) of the Act, advising the party that the application would be refused in its current form but offering the opportunity to vary the application (e.g., provide a new, compliant membership list) to avoid refusal."

This \nnotice will give the Party the opportunity to vary the application so refusal of the application may \nnot be required. \n\nAuthority \nSections 4, 123, 126, 129 and 131 and subsections 4(1) and 123(1) of the Electoral Act. \n\nBackground \nOn 24 November 2018, the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) received all of the \nrequirements from the Party for an application for registration as a non-Parliamentary party \nunder paragraph 126(1)(b) of the Electoral Act (folio 52). The application included a copy of the \nParty’s constitution (folio 16), an electronic list of between 500-550 members and a statutory \ndeclaration from the proposed Party secr tary regarding the authenticity of these documents \n(folio 21). The Party indicated that it did not wish to register an abbreviation or party logo  \n(folio 32).  On 23 January 2019 and 22 February 2019 the Party provided updates to its \nmembership list which impacted on  he  ime taken to assess the application.  \n\nInitial assessment of application \nIn the case of a non-Parliamen ary party paragraph 126(1)(b) of the Electoral Act provides that \nthe application may be made by 10 members of the party, of whom one is the secretary of the \nparty. The application is made by 10 members of the Party, one of which is the Party secretary, \nand sets out the names and addresses of the applicants, and particulars of the capacity in which \neach applicant makes the application (folio 30).  \n\nAssessment of constitution \nSections 4 and 123 of the Electoral Act define an eligible political party as an organisation the \nobject or activity, or one of the objects or activities, of which is the promotion of the election to \nthe Senate or to the House of Representatives of a candidate or candidates endorsed by it.  \n\nSubsection 123(1) of the Electoral Act defines an eligible political party as a political party that is \n“established on the basis of a written constitution (however described) that sets out the aims of \nthe party”. \n\nThe Party’s constitution meets this requirement because: \n\nPage 1    Minute \n\nReleasd under the Freedom of Information Act 1982LS7759 Document No. 25\n\n\n--- Page 2 ---\n\n•\n\nclause 3.2.16 states an objective of the Party is to “endorse Party candidates for Local,\nState and Federal elections” (folio 12).\n\nAssessment of proposed party name  \nName sought: Stop Selling Australia Party  \nSection 129 of the Electoral Act prohibits the registration of parties with certain names and \nabbreviations. An assessment of the proposed name was undertaken to ensure it did not \ncontravene s 129. The proposed name: \n\na) does not comprise more than six words\nb)\nc)\n\nis not obscene\nis not the name, abbreviation or acronym of the name of another political party (not\nbeing a political party that is related to the party to which the application relates) that is a\nrecognised political party\n\nd) does not so nearly resemble the name, abbreviation or acronym of the name of another\n\npolitical party (not being a political party that is related to the party to which the\napplication relates) that is a recognised political party that it is likely to be confused with\nor mistaken for that name or that abbreviation or acronym, as the case may be\n\nda) is not one that a reasonable person would think suggests a connection or relationship \nexists between the party and a registered party if that connection or relationship does \nnot in fact exist \n\ne) does not comprise the words ‘Independent Party’ or comprise or contain the word\n\n‘Independent’ and:\n\ni.\n\nthe name, or an abbreviation or acronym of the name, of a recognised political\nparty; or\n\nii. matter that so nearly resembles the name, or an abbreviation or acronym of the\nname, of a recognised political party  hat the matter is likely to be confused with\nor mistaken for that name or that abbreviation or acronym, as the case may be.\n\nThe federal Register was checked (folios 126-128) and that of each state and territory \n(folios 103-124) for parties with a similar name or abbreviation.  \n\nThe following party names contained the word “stop”: \n\n• Stop Population Growth Now Party (Electoral Commission of South Australia) (folio 110).\n\nThe following party abbreviations contained the word “stop”: \n\n• Stop Population Growth Now (Electoral Commission of South Australia) (folio 110).\n\nThe above parties share the word “stop” but share no further similarities with the Party’s \nproposed name. The Party’s proposed name is not the same as that of a recognised political \nparty. Furthe , there is enough of a difference between the Party’s name and the above name \nand abbreviation that it is not likely to be confused or mistaken, and a reasonable person would \nnot think that a connection or relationship exists between the parties.   \n\nBased on this information the Party’s name is not prohibited under s 129 of the Electoral Act. \n\nAssessment of membership \nSubsection 123(1) of the Electoral Act defines an eligible political party as a political party that is \neither a Parliamentary party or has at least 500 members. Paragraph 126(2)(ca) of the Electoral \n\nPage 2    Minute \n\nReleasd under the Freedom of Information Act 1982LS7759 Document No. 25\n\n\n--- Page 3 ---\n\nAct states that an application for registration must “include a list of the names of the 500 \nmembers of the party to be relied on for the purposes of registration”.  \n\nThe membership list submitted by the Party contained 550 members. This list was checked \nautomatically using RMANS, with 404 members identified on the electoral roll. A further 117 \nmembers were manually identified on the electoral roll using GENESIS while 29 members were \nunable to be matched to the roll.  \n\nFifteen members were identified as duplicates within the list and three members were identified \nas cross party duplicates. See folio 100 for a breakdown of the membership numbers.  \n\nA list of 503 members requires contact with a random sample of 26 members under the formula \nprovided by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (folio 94). For the AEC to be satisfied that the \nParty has the required 500 members, one denial of membership is permitted.  \n\nThe relevant numbers for this membership test were: \n\n1.\n2.\n3.\n\nthe random sample size was 26\nthe AEC attempted to contact 52 members, as some members were uncontactable\nthe highest 26 responses were:\n24 confirmed membership\n-\ntwo denied membership.\n-\n\nA record of those contacted is at folio 96. Based on this information the Party’s membership list \nfailed the membership testing assessment of the applica ion process. \n\nThe Party’s application will be set aside until the def ciencies identified are rectified and an \nupdated membership list is either resubmitted or  he application withdrawn. This will be raised \nwith the Party in the s 131 notice  \n\nOther procedural application requirements \nThe application meets the requirements of paragraphs 126(2)(c), 126(2)(d), 126(2)(e) and \n126(2)(g) of the Electoral Act as it:  \n•\n\nset out the name and address of the person who is to be the registered officer of the Party\nfor the purposes of the Electoral Act\nadvised that the Party wishes to receive moneys under Division 3 of Part XX of the Electoral\nAct\nset out the names and addresses of the applicants and particulars of the capacity in which\neach applicant makes the application, and\n\n•\n\n•\n\n• was accompanied by a fee of $500.\n\nConclusion \nAn assessment of the Party’s application was undertaken and it was determined that: \n•\n•\n•\n\nthe Party s constitution meets the requirements of s 4 and s 123 of the Electoral Act\nhe Party’s name is not prohibited under s 129 of the Electoral Act\nthe Party does not meet the membership requirements of subsection 123(1) and paragraph\n126(2)(ca) of the Electoral Act\nthe application meets the requirements of paragraphs 126(2)(c),126(2)(d),126(2)(e) and\n126(2)(g) of the Electoral Act.\n\n•\n\nBased on this information, the Party’s application, in its current form, does not satisfy the \nrequirements of Part XI of the Electoral Act.  \n\nPage 3    Minute \n\nReleasd under the Freedom of Information Act 1982LS7759 Document No. 25\n\n\n--- Page 4 ---\n\nSubsections 131(1) and (3) of the Electoral Act provide that where the Electoral Commission is \nof the opinion that the application should be refused, the Electoral Commission shall give written \nnotice to the applicant that it is of that opinion and that the applicant may lodge a written request \nvarying the application in the manner specified. \n\nThe s 131 notice will advise the Party it has the option to: \n\n•\n•\n\nvary the application in the manner specified in the request; or\nproceed with the application in the form in which it was lodged.\n\nPage 4    Minute \n\nReleasd under the Freedom of Information Act 1982LS7759 Document No. 25\n\n\n--- Page 5 ---\n\nRecommendation: \nThat as a delegate of the Electoral Commission for the purposes of subsection 131(1) of the \nElectoral Act, you: \n\n1. approve the notice under subsection 131(1) advising the registered officer of the Stop\n\nSelling Australia Party, \nform but that the applicants may vary the application so that it will not have to be refused \n(Attachment A).  \n\n, that the application will be refused in its current \n\nA/g Senior Party Registration Officer \nParliamentary and Party Registration \n\nMarch 2019 \n\nReviewed by \n\nDirector \nParliamentary and Party Registration \n\nMarch 2019 \n\nPage 5    Minute \n\nApproved / Not Approved \n\nJoanne Reid \nA/g Assistant Commissioner \nDelegate of the Electoral Commission \n\nMarch 2019 \n\n1Releasd under the Freedom of Information Act 1982LS7759 Document No. 2511\n\n\n\n--- Page 1 ---\n\nReleased under the Freedom of Information Act 1982LS7759 Document No. 26\n\n\n--- Page 2 ---\n\nReleased under the Freedom of Information Act 1982LS7759 Document No. 26\n\n\n\n--- Page 1 ---\n\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 1 ---\n\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 1 ---\n\nFOI request LS7759\n\nFrom:\nSent:\nTo:\nSubject:\nAttachments:\n\nCategories:\n\nMy apologies \n\nWednesday, 23 January 2019 5:35 PM\nFAD\nRE: Stp Selling Australia up dated membership list [SEC=UNCLASSIFIED]\nStop Selling Australia up dated members details.xls\n\nPlease find the list attached \n\nRegards \n\nFrom: FAD [mailto:FAD@aec.gov.au]  \nSent: Wednesday, 23 January 2019 5:21 PM \nTo: \nSubject: RE: Stp Selling Australia up dated membership list [SEC=UNCLASSIFIED] \n\nGood afternoon \n\nThank you for your email.

Of the 549 entries on the list of people provided by the Party in support of its \napplication 384 have been automatically matched to the Commonwealth Electoral Roll. Details for 167 of the entries \nof people provided by the Party in the current membership list require further manual checking by the AEC. For the \nAEC to undertake 165 manual checks on the current list will impact the expected time to process the Party’s \napplication. It also indicates that some of the details for these members are deficient or erroneous as they have not \nbeen automatically matched to the Commonwealth Electoral Roll. Should the AEC not be assured that more than \n500 members are electors (currently on the Commonwealth Electoral Roll) results in a party failing the membership \ntest.  \n\nCan you please advise if you would like the AEC to continue to process the list submitted by the Party or if the Party \nwill provide an alternate membership list as part of its application. The AEC will set aside the Party’s application until \nit receives an alternate membership list or is advised to continue testing the current list. \n\nThe party can use the details in the membership list to check that each member is enrolled by using the check my \nelectoral enrolment facility or eRoll which is available in all AEC offices. Party members used to support the \napplication must be listed on the Commonwealth Electoral Roll. It can save a party several weeks in delays if the \nparty does its own check of its members’ electoral enrolment online or at an AEC office. \n\nRegards \n\n | Assistant Director  \n\nParliamentary and Party Registration Section | Disclosure, Assurance & Engagement Branch \nAustralian Electoral Commission \nT: \n\nFrom: \nSent: Saturday, 24 November 2018 1:58 PM \nTo: FAD <FAD@aec.gov.au> \nSubject: RE: Recommencement of processing party registration applications - s 127 Commonwealth Electoral Act \n1918 [SEC=UNCLASSIFIED] \n\nAfternoon \n\n4\n\n111113Released under the Freedom of Information Act 1982LS7759 Document No. 5171\n\n\n--- Page 5 ---\n\nPlease find the amended membership list now showing 549 members as requested. \n\nPlease let me know if you require any further information.
