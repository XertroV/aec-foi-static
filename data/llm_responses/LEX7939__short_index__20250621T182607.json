While unable to provide future data for 2025, the response noted a decrease in designated electors during recent federal elections (e.g., 104 in 2019, 70 in 2022). New declarations fluctuated significantly by financial year, with 37 in 2022/23, 1 in 2023/24, and a notable spike to 211 in 2024/25 to date, all made by a delegate of the Electoral Commissioner. Internal reviews saw 4 applications in both 2022/23 and 2024/25, with most declarations confirmed but one set aside in the latter period, while there were no applications to the Administrative Review Tribunal or declarations ceasing effect under the specified legal provision."
