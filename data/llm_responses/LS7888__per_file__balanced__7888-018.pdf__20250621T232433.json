            "text": "## Document Summary\n\nThis document is an internal email exchange within the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) from December 2018. The discussion centers on a statement made by MP Warren Snowden in Parliament on December 3, 2018, asserting that \"in 2014 the AEC had already identified that 42 per cent of Indigenous people were not enrolled to vote.\" AEC staff, particularly Michael Roden, clarify that this 2014 figure was an initial, tentative estimate based \"solely using regression methods.\" Roden emphasizes that \"many methodological changes\" have occurred since then, leading to a \"general improvement in enrolment rates,\" implying the 2014 figure is outdated and based on a superseded approach. Guy Lewis confirms that the 2014 figure was cited in a 2015 ANAO report.\n\n## Relevance to FOI Request LS7888\n\nThis document is highly relevant to FOI request LS7888 as it directly addresses the evolution and improvement of the Australian Electoral Commission's (AEC) methodology for the Indigenous Electoral Participation Program (IEPP).\n\n*   **Methodology Design and Catalyst:** The email thread explicitly contrasts an older, \"tentative\" 2014 methodology based \"solely using regression methods\" with the AEC's current approach (as of late 2018), which has undergone \"many methodological changes.\" This aligns precisely with the FOI request's focus on the \"new methodology\" and the revelation that it replaced \"less reliable prior regression models.\"\n*   **Accuracy and Outcomes:** Michael Roden's statement about \"many methodological changes since then, plus a general improvement in enrolment rates\" supports the FOI request's finding that the new approach is \"more robust\" and contributed to an \"upward trend\" in Indigenous enrolment rates, contrasting with the higher non-enrolment figure from the older method.\n*   **Timeline:** The document falls within the 2018-2019 timeframe specified by the FOI request, providing contemporaneous insight into the AEC's understanding of its Indigenous enrolment data and methodological shifts during that period."

  "prompt": "Considering this document as part of an FOI request, summarize the document and its relevance to the FOI request in markdown format. FYI the overview of the FOI request is: FOI request LS7888 sought documents (2018-2019) on the Australian Electoral Commission's (AEC) new methodology for its Indigenous Electoral Participation Program (IEPP), specifically its design, testing, and implementation, including catalysts, tracking, outcomes, Indigenous involvement, and cost/staff. The released documents, primarily emails and internal papers, reveal that the core of the new methodology is the direct matching of electoral roll data with Centrelink Indigeneity data, a more robust approach initiated internally to improve accuracy, replacing less reliable prior regression models. This method helped identify over 107,000 unenrolled Indigenous individuals, contributing to enrolment stimulation events (e.g., 2,646 new enrolments). The documents confirm estimated national Indigenous enrolment rates of 76.4% (June 2018) and 76.6% (June 2019), demonstrating a significant upward trend from previous estimates, though they provide limited information on Indigenous involvement in the design process or the final cost and exact staffing for the project.\n\nDocument Text:\n\nOwen Jones\n\nFrom:\nSent:\nTo:\nSubject:\n\nGuy Lewis\nWednesday, 5 December 2018 8:43 AM\nMichael Roden\nRE: Parliamentary review 3 December 2018 [SEC=UNCLASSIFIED]\n\nYes I found it cited in the 2015 ANAO report \n\nGuy \n\nFrom: Michael Roden  \nSent: Wednesday, 5 December 2018 8:20 AM \nTo: Guy Lewis  \nSubject: RE: Parliamentary review 3 December 2018 [SEC=UNCLASSIFIED] \n\nGuy, I think that reflects the first cut of the Indigenous enrolment rates we tentatively trialled 4 (?) years ago, solely \nusing regression methods. Many methodological changes since then, plus a general improvement in enrolment \nrates. \n\nCheers \n\nm. \n\nFrom: Guy Lewis <Guy.Lewis@aec.gov.au>  \nSent: Tuesday, 4 December 2018 9:17 AM \nTo: Michael Roden <Michael.Roden@aec.gov.au> \nSubject: FW: Parliamentary review 3 December 2018 [SEC=UNCLASSIFIED] \n\nMichael, are you able to shed light on the following statement by Warren Snowden (Lingiari) in parliament \nyesterday? Do you recall where this statement might have come from? \n\n‘in 2014 the AEC had already identified that 42 per cent of Indigenous people were not enrolled to vote.’ \n\nRegards \n\nguy \n\nFrom: Delyse Paliaga <Delyse.Paliaga@aec.gov.au>  \nSent: Tuesday, 4 December 2018 9:12 AM \nTo: Guy Lewis <Guy.Lewis@aec.gov.au>; Darryl Miller <darryl.miller@aec.gov.au> \nCc: Jaime Garrido <Jaime.Garrido@aec.gov.au>; Sarah Gowty <Sarah.Gowty@aec.gov.au>; Robyn Legg \n<Robyn.Legg@aec.gov.au> \nSubject: FW: Parliamentary review 3 December 2018 [SEC=UNCLASSIFIED] \n\nHi Guy and Darryl \n\nGuy are you able to check the figures re enrolment that Mr Snowden quotes in his speech below? \nDarryl do you have any comments on Mr Snowdens speech. \n\nDelyse \n\nDelyse Paliaga | Director Roll Program and Community Engagement  \nRoll Management & Community Engagement Branch \nAustralian Electoral Commission \n\n1\n\nLS7888 Released Document No. 18Released under the Freedom of Information Act 1982\fReleased under the Freedom of Information Act 1982\fReleased under the Freedom of Information Act 1982\fReleased under the Freedom of Information Act 1982\fReleased under the Freedom of Information Act 1982\fREDACTION CODES \n\nPersonal Information (name) redacted. \n\nPersonal Information (date of birth) redacted. \n\nPersonal Information (photograph) redacted \n\nPersonal Information (facsimile of signature) redacted. \n\nPersonal Information (facsimile of manuscript initialling) redacted. \n\nPersonal Information (Individual’s address) redacted. \n\nPersonal Information (individual’s telephone number) redacted. \n\nPersonal Information (individual’s opinion) redacted. \n\nPersonal Information (opinion about individual) redacted. \n\nPersonal Information (employment history) redacted. \n\nPersonal Information (qualifications) redacted. \n\nPersonal Information (health) redacted. \n\nPersonal Information (identifying individual) redacted. \n\nBusiness information (Bank Account details) redacted. \n\nBusiness information (Billing Account details) redacted. \n\nBusiness information (internal operations) redacted. \n\nLegal Professional Communication redacted. \n\nDeliberative material redacted. \n\nIrrelevant material redacted. \n\nElectoral Roll material redacted. \n\nTests, examinations or audits material redacted. \n\nManagement or assessment of personnel material redacted. \n\nProper and efficient conduct of the operations of AEC material redacted. \n\nLawful methods or procedures for preventing, detecting, investigating, or \ndealing with matters arising out of, breaches or evasions of the law. \n\nTrade Secrets. \n\nCommercial valuable information. \n\nFinancial interests of the Commonwealth. \n\nProperty interests of the Commonwealth. \n\n1 \n\n2 \n\n3 \n\n4 \n\n5 \n\n6 \n\n7 \n\n8 \n\n9 \n\n10 \n\n11 \n\n12 \n\n13 \n\n14 \n\n15 \n\n16 \n\n17 \n\n18 \n\n19 \n\n20 \n\n21 \n\n22 \n\n23 \n\n24 \n\n25 \n\n26 \n\n27 \n\n28 \n\n\f\n\nProvide only the markdown formatted summary text.
