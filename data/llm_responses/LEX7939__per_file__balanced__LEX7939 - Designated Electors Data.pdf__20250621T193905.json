While it refers the requester to the AEC website for current total designated elector numbers and their geographical distribution, it provides comprehensive data on new declarations, internal review processes, and the absence of higher-level tribunal reviews or automatic cessation of declarations. The data confirms the FOI request's findings regarding the notable increase in new declarations in FY2024/25 (211 compared to previous low numbers), the role of the Electoral Commissioner's delegate in these declarations, the small number of internal review applications (4 in FY2022/23 and 4 in FY2024/25) with predominantly confirmed outcomes (except for one set aside in FY2024/25), and the lack of applications to the Administrative Review Tribunal or declarations ceasing effect under s 202AH(3) for the specified periods."

  "prompt": "Considering this document as part of an FOI request, summarize the document and its relevance to the FOI request in markdown format. FYI the overview of the FOI request is: FOI request LEX7939 sought statistical data from the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) on \"designated electors,\" including their overall numbers, new declarations, and associated review processes. While the current total number of designated electors was referenced as available on their website rather than directly provided, the AEC reported 211 new declarations in FY2024/25 to date, a notable increase from previous years, with all declarations made by a delegate of the Electoral Commissioner. The request also revealed a small number of internal review applications (four in FY2022/23 and four in FY2024/25), predominantly resulting in confirmed decisions, though one was set aside in FY2024/25. No applications for review to the Administrative Review Tribunal or instances of declarations ceasing effect under s 202AH(3) were recorded for the specified periods.\n\nDocument Text:\n\nLEX7939  \n\nFOI Request LEX7939 â€“ Designated Electors Data  \n\nI seek access to the following, as at the close of rolls 7 April 2025: \n\n1.
