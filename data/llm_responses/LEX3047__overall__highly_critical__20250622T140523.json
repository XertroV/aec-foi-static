            "text": "The released FOI documents paint a damning picture of the Australian Electoral Commission's (AEC) systemic failures in regulating electoral communications, revealing a pattern of inaction, incompetence, and a seeming reluctance to enforce the very laws it is mandated to uphold. Far from being a robust guardian of electoral integrity, the AEC appears to operate as a passive, advisory service, exhibiting a profound abdication of its core responsibilities.\n\n**1. Systemic Failure to Act and Concealment of Inaction:**\nThe most glaring indictment is the sheer volume of complaints for which the AEC has provided *only* the initial complaint, with **no corresponding \"final AEC correspondence\" or evidence of action**. Of the eleven distinct complaints for which documents were provided, a staggering **eight** lack any discernible AEC response or outcome. These include critical allegations:\n*   **\"South Perth Progressive\" (7 May 2019):** A highly detailed complaint outlining a deliberate attempt to mislead voters by a Facebook page \"purporting to be a community group\" running *paid political advertising* without proper authorisation, directly linked to a Labor Party member. The complete absence of an AEC response implies either deliberate inaction on a politically sensitive matter or a catastrophic failure in record-keeping.\n*   **Liberal Party \"Other media\" (10 May 2019):** A direct complaint against a major political party for unauthorised advertising. The lack of any AEC response strongly suggests preferential treatment or a calculated avoidance of challenging powerful entities.\n*   **\"Our Vote Our Community\" (12 April 2019):** Accusations of \"no authorisation for misleading ads,\" left unaddressed.\n*   **Independent Candidate (14 April 2019 - two complaints):** Two distinct complaints regarding both a website and a print advertisement lacking authorisation. The AEC's silence suggests a wholesale disregard for compliance from an independent candidate.\n*   **\"Bass Deserves Better\" (18 April 2019):** A complaint explicitly detailing a Facebook page run by \"a known senior union member\" masquerading as an \"apolitical group\" to campaign against conservatives without authorisation. The AEC's failure to provide any response here points to a shocking lack of will to address sophisticated attempts at voter manipulation, particularly when connected to organised political interests.\n*   **\"RiteOn!\" & \"Outrage Institute\" (18 April 2019):** Allegations that these pages and websites, strongly linked to the Liberal Party, were operating without authorisation. The absence of an AEC response allows a damning inference of deliberate inaction when faced with politically inconvenient complaints.\n*   **\"Agents in their Community\" (17 May 2019):** This complaint is uniquely damning as the complainant explicitly states: \"As per my last complaint, I expect sweet fuck all to occur. The complaint process is just to make people feel like the rules are being upheld.\" The AEC's subsequent failure to provide a response to *this specific complaint* serves as a self-fulfilling prophecy of their own ineffectiveness and validates the public's direct contempt for their complaint process.\n\nThe AEC's inability or refusal to provide \"final correspondence\" for the majority of requested complaints points to either a deep-seated incompetence in maintaining proper records of enforcement actions or a cynical, calculated decision to withhold evidence of pervasive inaction.\n\n**2. A Regulator Without Teeth: Passive Advisories and Burden Shifting:**\nFor the few complaints where AEC correspondence *is* provided (\"Friends of the ABC,\" \"Vote Tony Out,\" \"****** - for WILLS\"), the AEC's approach is revealed to be astonishingly weak and non-committal. Instead of issuing directives or initiating punitive measures, the AEC adopts a passive, advisory tone:\n*   In the \"Friends of the ABC\" case, the AEC merely \"received a *further* complaint,\" implying previous inaction, then proceeds to \"request\" the alleged offender to \"please consider\" and \"advise by reply email\" on their *own* compliance. This is a ludicrous abdication of investigative responsibility, forcing the alleged offender to self-assess their lawfulness.\n*   For \"Vote Tony Out\" and \"****** - for WILLS,\" the AEC's letters, while more detailed, still amount to polite requests for self-correction by a specified deadline. They \"recommend\" actions and vaguely mention potential penalties or the ability for *other candidates* (not the AEC itself) to seek injunctions. There is no evidence of the AEC issuing fines, mandating content removal, or pursuing legal action themselves. This portrays the AEC as a toothless tiger, a body that merely issues warnings rather than genuinely enforcing the law.\n*   The AEC's lengthy explanations of legal definitions and disclosure thresholds to alleged offenders effectively serve as a guide for avoiding compliance or a warning to rectify issues *before* any real AEC-initiated enforcement occurs, rather than a genuine investigation into past breaches.\n\n**3. The Illusion of Oversight:**\nThe cumulative effect of these documents is a strong impression that the AEC's complaint process is less about robust regulation and more about creating a performative \"theatre\" of oversight. Complainants expend effort to identify breaches, but the AEC consistently fails to demonstrate meaningful follow-through. This undermines the democratic process by allowing a climate where electoral rules, particularly regarding transparency of funding and authorship, can be flouted with apparent impunity.\n\nIn conclusion, these FOI documents expose an Australian Electoral Commission that is critically flawed. Its systematic failure to provide evidence of action on the majority of complaints, coupled with its demonstrably weak, advisory-only approach when it does respond, points to an institution either woefully incompetent in its duties or deliberately complicit in allowing electoral deception to flourish unchecked. The cynical assessment of the process by a frustrated complainant resonates powerfully, confirming that the AEC is widely perceived as a regulator that exists merely to maintain the illusion of electoral integrity."

The Electoral Backgrounder: Electoral communications and authorisation requirements on the AEC website \nprovides more information.  \n\nThe Electoral Act requires the communication of certain electoral matters to be authorised.  ‘Electoral matter’ is \ndefined in section 4AA(1) of the Electoral Act to be a matter communicated or intended to be communicated for the \ndominant purpose of influencing the way electors vote in a federal election. \n\nA communication containing electoral matter must be authorised if it is: \n\n  a paid electoral advertisement, or \n\n  a sticker, fridge magnet, leaflet, flyer, pamphlet, notice, poster or how-to-vote card, or \n\n  a matter communicated by or on behalf of a disclosure entity (e.g. a candidate, Senator or Member of the \nHouse of Representatives, registered political party, an associated entity or other person or group who is \nrequired to submit a return under Part XX of the Electoral Act). \n\nIt is an offence under section 321D(5) of the Electoral Act to make these types of electoral communications without \nproper authorisation.   \n\nThe AEC has checked the Vote Tony Out campaign sites and identified the following issues. \n\nAuthorisation of Vote Tony Out stickers \n\nThe stickers for sale on the Vote Tony Out website contain electoral matter that requires authorisation under \nsection 321D(1)(b) of the Electoral Act.  Can you please stop selling and distributing the unauthorised stickers.  The \nother merchandise for sale on the website does not need to be authorised. \n\nAuthorisation of Vote Tony Out Facebook page \n\nThe Vote Tony Out Facebook page is currently running paid advertising promoting the Vote Tony Out rally on \n5 May.  This electoral advertising needs to be authorised or have a link to an authorised Facebook page.  The \nauthorisation of a social media site only needs the name and city of the person authorising the site.  The \nauthorisation can be added to the “About” section in a Facebook page. \n\nAuthorisation of Vote Tony Out website \n\n1\n\n47F47F\n\n\n--- Page 2 ---\n\nI note you have an authorisation on the Mail chimp webpage supporting the Vote Tony Out website.  To be prudent \nI recommend adding this authorisation to the bottom of the Vote Tony Out website (alongside the copyright notice) \nand/or on the website “About” page. \n\nWhether Vote Tony Out is or will become a third party (disclosure entity) for the purpose of the Electoral Act \n\nAs noted above a disclosure entity must authorise all electoral communications.  A ‘disclosure entity’ is defined in \nsection 321B of the Electoral Act to include a person or entity who will incur electoral expenditure during a financial \nyear above the disclosure threshold (currently $13,800). \n\nIf you think you will spend more than $13,8000 this financial year on electoral communications then you will need to \nprovide a disclosure return to the AEC under Part XX of the Electoral Act and also must authorise all your electoral \ncommunications.  There are also other obligations on third parties in the Electoral Act, such as restrictions on \nreceiving foreign donations.  \n\nActions \n\nCan you please: \n\n  Stop the sale and distribution of unauthorised Vote Tony Out stickers from the Vote Tony Out website.  If \n\nyou want to sell more stickers, the stickers will need to have an authorisation added. \n\n  Authorise any paid electoral advertising on social media or elsewhere \n\n  Authorise the Vote Tony Out Facebook page and website (and if the Vote Tony Out Twitter site and \n\nInstagram page are also running paid electoral advertising or you think you will become a disclosure entity \nfor the purpose of the Electoral Act, these sites should also include an authorisation)  \n\nCan you please take this action by COB Monday 29 April and advise the AEC of this action. \n\nYours sincerely \n\n | Principal Government Lawyer \n\nElectoral Authorisation Section | Legal & Procurement Branch \nAustralian Electoral Commission \nT: \n\n2\n\n47FSection 47F\n\n\n\n--- Page 1 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 2 ---\n\nFrom: \n<\nSent: Saturday, 20 April 2019 12:45 PM \nTo: \n <\nSubject: Authorisation \nImportance: High \n\n@nsw.liberal.org.au>  \n\n@aec.gov.au> \n\nDear \n\nI draw to your attention the website www.votetonyout.com which is selling a range of merchandise in the context of \nthe forthcoming federal election. \n\nIn particular, the merchandise features messages calling for voters to vote out the Liberal candidate for Warringah, \nTony Abbott, and alternatively supporting the independent candidate, Zali Steggall. \n\nI note that neither the website, nor the merchandise being sold through the website (that requires authorisation), \ncontains the required particulars in accordance with Part XXA of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 (‘the Act’).   \n\nAccording to a search of ASIC records of the ABN listed on the website \nOUT was registered on 5/04/2019 to a \n\n of \n\n the business VOTE TONY \n\n. \n\nI would ask that the AEC investigates this breach of the Act and take appropriate action if warranted. \n\nRegards, \n\nMessage protected by MailGuard: e-mail anti-virus, anti-spam and content filtering. \nhttp://www.mailguard.com.au/mg \n\nClassified by \n\nFor Official Use Only \n\n@aec.gov.au on 21/04/2019 12:53:21 PM \n\n2\n\n47F47F47F47F47F47F47F47F47F47F\n\n\n\n--- Page 1 ---\n\nFrom:\nSent:\nTo:\nSubject:\n\nAttachments:\n\nM\n\nm  \n\nm \n\nFriday, 17 May 2019 2:40 PM\nLegal Services Mailbox\n[COMPLAINT Political advertising] \n[SEC=UNCLASSIFIED]\n[Attachment 01]\n\nWWW* \n\n.jpg; [Attachment 02]-\n\njpg\n\nComplaint \n\nCategory \n\nPolitical advertising \n\nPrimary Details \n\nGiven name(s): \nSurname: \nOrganisation: \nEmail: \nPhone number: \n\nElectoral division: \n\nComplaint Details \n\nThe Facebook page: https://www.facebook.com/AgentsintheirCommunity/ is running political ads \nwithout authorisation. \n\nExpected Outcome \n\nAs per my last complaint, I expect sweet fuck all to occur.

These obligations are contained in sections 321D(1) and (5) of the Electoral Act. The definition of \n‘disclosure entity’ includes, amongst others, a senator or member of the House of Representatives, a person who is \na candidate in an election or by-election, or a person who was a candidate in an election or by-election of a member \nof the House of Representatives in the previous 4 years, or an election of Senators for a State or Territory in the \nprevious 7 years.  \n\nWe note that you stood as a candidate in the division of Wills in the 2016 federal election and as such, all \ncommunications of electoral matter by, or on behalf of, yourself are required by the Electoral Act to include an \nauthorisation. We also note that some of your posts are currently being sponsored as advertisements which also \nrequire an authorisation. \n\nRelevantly for websites and social media, the authorisation must include: \n\n(a) the name of the person who either approved the content of the electoral matter before it was \n\ncommunicated, or otherwise the person that communicated the electoral matter; and \n\n(b) the relevant town or city of the person. \n\nMore information on the authorisation requirements is in the Electoral Backgrounder on the AEC website. If you \nrequire clarification, the AEC recommends you seek independent legal advice. \n\nCan you please address these omissions by adding the required authorisation to the ‘About’ section of the \n\n Thinker Politician & Architect to the Very Rich & Worthy’ \nFacebook pages by COB this Wednesday 1 May 2019 and send a reply email to authorisationsection@aec.gov.au \nonce this is done? \n\n for WILLS’ and \n\n1\n\n47F47F47F47F47F47F\n\n\n--- Page 2 ---\n\nFailure to authorise electoral communications where required can result in a penalty of up to $25,200. One further \npoint to note on the authorisation of electoral matter; whilst the Electoral Act enables the AEC to seek an injunction \nagainst an electoral communication that does not meet the requirements in the Electoral Act, now that the federal \nelection has been called, the Electoral Act enables other persons who have been nominated as candidates to also \nseek an injunction against any unauthorised electoral communications. \n\nYours sincerely \n\n | Senior Lawyer  \n\nElectoral Authorisation Section | Legal & Procurement Branch \nAustralian Electoral Commission \nT: \n\n2\n\n47F47F\n\n\n\n--- Page 1 ---\n\nFrom:\nSent:\nTo:\nSubject:\n\nTuesday, 23 April 2019 12:10 AM\nLegal Services Mailbox\n[COMPLAINT Political advertising] \n[SEC=UNCLASSIFIED]\n\n *WWW* \n\nComplaint \n\nCategory \n\nPolitical advertising \n\nPrimary Details \n\nGiven name(s): \nSurname: \nOrganisation: \nEmail: \nPhone number: \n\nElectoral division: \n\nHolt \n\nComplaint Details \n\nThe Facebook page \n\n for WILLS https://www.facebook.com/pg/\n\nfor-WILLS-2337394036272646/ carries no authorisation or contact details and is making \n\nspecific political commentary.
