Page 4 features a footer including the text \"Follow us online Proudly supporting 1 degree, A News Corp Australia initiative.\" Page 5 presents a generic legal disclaimer regarding the confidentiality and intended use of email communications and attachments. No substantive content, specific details, or investigative findings related to Andrew Laming MP or his Facebook pages are present.\n\n### Relevance to FOI Request\n\nThe document's primary relevance to the FOI request is its identification as an official record of the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC), indicated by the \"AEC.0002.0001\" numbering sequence. While it offers no direct information or evidence pertaining to the AEC's investigation into Andrew Laming MP's electoral authorisation compliance, its inclusion suggests it is part of the administrative or peripheral documentation released in response to the FOI request. It may represent placeholder pages, cover sheets, or an inadvertently included boilerplate section from a larger document, rather than providing direct insight into the investigation's details or findings. The mention of \"News Corp Australia\" is a generic corporate sponsorship and does not directly relate to the specific media reports from *The Guardian* that triggered the inquiry."

Do not include any conversational filler or preamble.To aid you, the overview of the FOI request is: [REQUEST OVERVIEW START] The FOI request disclosed documents detailing the Australian Electoral Commission's (AEC) investigation into Andrew Laming MP's Facebook pages for compliance with federal electoral authorisation laws. This inquiry was triggered by public complaints and media reports, notably from *The Guardian*, alleging Laming used numerous pages (e.g., \"Redland Bay Bulletin,\" \"Redlands Institute\") disguised as community or news groups to promote political content and attack opponents without mandatory disclosures. The AEC confirmed an active investigation, noting 2018 Electoral Act amendments broadened social media authorisation, and issued formal notices to Laming for detailed information and to third parties (like Facebook) for data, with Facebook confirming its cooperation. Findings revealed some pages were removed or updated with authorisation, while others remained active and unauthorised.\n [REQUEST OVERVIEW END] \n\n--- MAIN DOCUMENT TEXT START ---\n\n\n\n--- Page 1 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 2 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 3 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 4 ---\n\nAEC.0002.0001.1690\n\nFollow us online   Proudly supporting 1 degree, A News Corp Australia initiative.\n\n\n--- Page 5 ---\n\nAEC.0002.0001.1691\n\nThis message and its attachments may contain legally privileged or confidential information.
