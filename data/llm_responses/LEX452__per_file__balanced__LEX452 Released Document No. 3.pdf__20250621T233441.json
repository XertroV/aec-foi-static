            "text": "*   **Document Summary:** This document provides a comprehensive list of \"Redaction Codes\" used by the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) when releasing information under the Freedom of Information Act 1982. It enumerates 24 distinct categories of information that may be withheld, ranging from personal details (e.g., name, address, date of birth, opinion) and business information (e.g., bank account details) to legal, deliberative, operational, and electoral roll material. Each category is assigned a code and a brief description explaining the nature of the redacted content.\n*   **Relevance to FOI Request LEX452:** This document is crucial context for FOI request LEX452, which sought documents related to Zi Chun Wang's donations. The FOI request overview explicitly states that the three AEC letters released \"feature redactions.\" This document serves as the key or legend for those redactions, explaining the specific legal or administrative grounds under which certain information was withheld from the released AEC letters concerning Zi Chun Wang's donor obligations for the 2013/2014 financial year. It clarifies *why* parts of the other released materials are not visible, rather than being one of the substantive letters itself."

FYI the overview of the FOI request is: FOI request LEX452 sought documents concerning Zi Chun Wang's donations for the 2013/2014 financial year, resulting in the release of three letters from the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC).
