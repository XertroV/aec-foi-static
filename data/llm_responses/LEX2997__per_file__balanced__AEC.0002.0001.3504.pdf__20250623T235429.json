The email is addressed to the \"Community and International Engagement\" department and is titled \"For Action: ELT Reporting [SEC=OFFICIAL]\". Its purpose is to request input on \"upcoming events, key highlights, issues, or potential risks\" for the weekly Executive Leadership Team (ELT) report, with a submission deadline of 2 pm that day. It also references a previous week's report attached for context (though the attachment itself is not provided).\n\n### Relevance to FOI Request:\n\nThis document's relevance to the FOI request regarding the AEC's investigation into Andrew Laming MP's Facebook pages is indirect and administrative. It demonstrates the AEC's internal reporting mechanisms to its Executive Leadership Team. While the email itself does not contain details of the Laming investigation, it indicates the process through which such an ongoing investigation, if deemed a \"key highlight,\" \"issue,\" or \"potential risk,\" would be reported internally to senior management. The specific content related to the Laming inquiry would likely be found in the weekly ELT reports themselves, which are generated from responses to such requests."

Do not include any conversational filler or preamble.To aid you, the overview of the FOI request is: [REQUEST OVERVIEW START] The FOI request disclosed documents detailing the Australian Electoral Commission's (AEC) investigation into Andrew Laming MP's Facebook pages for compliance with federal electoral authorisation laws. This inquiry was triggered by public complaints and media reports, notably from *The Guardian*, alleging Laming used numerous pages (e.g., \"Redland Bay Bulletin,\" \"Redlands Institute\") disguised as community or news groups to promote political content and attack opponents without mandatory disclosures. The AEC confirmed an active investigation, noting 2018 Electoral Act amendments broadened social media authorisation, and issued formal notices to Laming for detailed information and to third parties (like Facebook) for data, with Facebook confirming its cooperation. Findings revealed some pages were removed or updated with authorisation, while others remained active and unauthorised.\n [REQUEST OVERVIEW END] \n\n--- MAIN DOCUMENT TEXT START ---\n\n\n\n--- Page 1 ---\n\nAEC.0002.0001.3504\n\nFrom:                                 Megan MackieSent:                                  Thu, 6 May 2021 09:53:30 +1000To:                                      Community and International EngagementSubject:                             For Action: ELT Reporting [SEC=OFFICIAL]Attachments:                   03.
