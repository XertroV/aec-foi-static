  "prompt": "With a highly critical view, provide a scathing, single-paragraph summary in markdown format of the following FOI request overview:\n\nSummary:\n\nThe Australian Electoral Commission's (AEC) response to FOI LEX7939 exposes a deeply concerning pattern of opacity, inconsistency, and a potential abdication of accountability regarding the 'designated elector' scheme.\n\nFirstly, the outright refusal to provide current, critical data on the number of designated electors, broken down by state and electoral division (Items 1, 1a, 1b), is an egregious act of stonewalling. This deliberate withholding of fundamental, real-time information, while simultaneously offering irrelevant historical data already publicly available, is a clear attempt to conceal the current scope and impact of the scheme. This lack of transparency undermines public trust and suggests the AEC is actively hiding something about the integrity of its electoral roll management.\n\nThe declared numbers of designated electors (Item 2) reveal an alarming inconsistency, fluctuating wildly from 37 (2022/23) to a paltry 1 (2023/24), then surging inexplicably to 211 (2024/25 to date). This drastic, unexplained spike in the current financial year, coinciding with the lead-up to a potential election, screams of arbitrary decision-making, a sudden, undeclared policy shift, or a reactive, politically motivated purge of the electoral roll. The near-cessation of declarations in 2023/24 followed by an explosion in 2024/25 points to a chaotic, rather than principled, application of this power.\n\nFurther compounding concerns, *every single* declaration across all financial years was made by a \"delegate of the Electoral Commissioner\" (Item 2a). This wholesale delegation of a critical function indicates a severe lack of direct oversight by the Electoral Commissioner themselves, raising questions about accountability, consistency of application, and the potential for abuse of power by lower-level officials. It suggests a deliberate distancing of the top brass from potentially controversial decisions, diluting responsibility and oversight.\n\nThe internal review process is exposed as a mere rubber stamp (Items 3 & 4). Despite 211 declarations in 2024/25, only 4 applications for internal review were received, with 3 of those being \"confirmed\" and only a single declaration \"set aside.\" In 2022/23, all 4 reviews resulted in \"confirmed\" decisions. This near-perfect confirmation rate for the AEC's initial declarations demonstrates that the internal review mechanism is not a genuine avenue for redress but rather a superficial exercise designed to affirm existing decisions, making it virtually impossible for individuals to challenge their designation.\n\nThe complete absence of applications to the Administrative Review Tribunal (ART) in 2024/25 (Item 4 - second instance), despite the surge in declarations and the internal review process's high confirmation rate, is highly damning. This suggests a system designed to suppress external scrutiny and prevent meaningful judicial oversight. It implies that the process of challenging a designation is either prohibitively complex, costly, intimidating, or completely unknown to those affected, effectively making the AEC the sole and unchallengeable arbiter of its own potentially flawed decisions. This lack of external accountability for a fundamental democratic right is a critical failure.\n\nFinally, the declaration that zero declarations ceased to have effect by virtue of s 202AH(3) across three financial years (Item 5) implies a draconian, permanent designation. If this section provides a mechanism for declarations to naturally expire or be revoked under certain conditions, its complete non-use suggests that once designated, an individual is effectively permanently removed or altered on the electoral roll with no practical pathway for their status to be reversed, solidifying the impression of an authoritarian and unchallengeable system.\n\nIn summary, the FOI documents depict an AEC operating with severe transparency deficits, exhibiting erratic and potentially politically motivated actions, lacking internal accountability and oversight, and implementing a review process that is a sham designed to prevent legitimate challenge and external scrutiny. This paints a disturbing picture of an electoral body that may be actively undermining voter rights and public trust through its opaque and unchallengeable administration of the 'designated elector' scheme.\n\nProvide only the markdown formatted summary text. Do not include any conversational filler or preamble."
