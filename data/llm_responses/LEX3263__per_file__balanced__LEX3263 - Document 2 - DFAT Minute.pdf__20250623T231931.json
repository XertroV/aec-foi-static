Do not include any conversational filler or preamble.To aid you, the overview of the FOI request is: [REQUEST OVERVIEW START] An FOI request (LEX3263) sought data on Australian federal election voting processes in New Zealand over the last four general elections, specifically covering in-person and postal declaration votes at the Wellington High Commission and Auckland Consulate-General, postal votes returned directly to the AEC from NZ addresses, and briefing documents for the decision not to offer in-person voting in Wellington in 2022. Released documents provided this quantitative data and a DFAT minute, revealing Wellington had 0 in-person votes in 2022 (resulting in a significant increase in its postal votes), while Auckland continued in-person voting but also saw a substantial rise in postal votes. Direct AEC postal returns from NZ significantly decreased in 2022. The DFAT minute confirmed the Wellington decision stemmed from a redacted risk analysis and recommendations for overseas voting.\n [REQUEST OVERVIEW END] \n\n--- MAIN DOCUMENT TEXT START ---\n\n\n\n--- Page 1 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 2 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 3 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 4 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 5 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 6 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 7 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 8 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 9 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 10 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 11 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 12 ---\n\ns 22(1)(a)(ii)\n\n\n--- Page 13 ---\n\ns 22(1)(a)(ii)\n\n\n--- Page 14 ---\n\ns 22(1)(a)(ii)\n\n\n--- Page 15 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 16 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 17 ---\n\ns 22(1)(a)(ii)\n\n\n--- Page 18 ---\n\ns 22(1)(a)(ii)\n\n\n--- Page 19 ---\n\ns 22(1)(a)(ii)\n\n\n--- Page 20 ---\n\ns 22(1)(a)(ii)\n\n\n--- Page 21 ---\n\ns 22(1)(a)(ii)\n\n\n--- Page 22 ---\n\ns 22(1)(a)(ii)\n\n\n--- Page 23 ---\n\ns 22(1)(a)(ii)\n\n\n--- Page 24 ---\n\ns 22(1)(a)(ii)\n\n"
