            "text": "This document is an internal review request, dated April 11, 2022, challenging the Australian Electoral Commission's (AEC) decision to register the \"David Pocock party.\" The request raises two primary objections:\n*   **Candidate Eligibility:** The objector contends that David Pocock had publicly admitted to being a citizen of Zimbabwe, making him ineligible for the Senate. It is argued that the AEC's decision-maker failed to make a factual finding on this critical issue and that registering a party named after an ineligible individual is contrary to the Commonwealth Electoral Act's scheme and could mislead the public.\n*   **Party Name Consistency:** The objector asserts that \"David Pocock\" as a party name is inconsistent with the legal concept of a \"party,\" which typically represents a body of persons rather than an individual. Concerns are raised about potential voter confusion on the ballot paper, where \"David Pocock\" would appear both above the line (as a party) and below the line (as a candidate), potentially creating an unfair advantage.\nThe objector claims the AEC adopted an \"extraordinarily narrow approach to statutory interpretation\" and a \"ticking boxes\" methodology, failing to consider the Act's broader scheme and purpose.\n\nThis document is highly relevant to the FOI request (LEX3070) as it directly concerns a specific challenge to an AEC party registration decision, aligning with the request's focus on applications made under s 141(2) during early 2022 regarding party registration and deregistration reviews. It specifically addresses the \"objection to the registration of the David Pocock party based on candidate eligibility and name consistency,\" as highlighted in the request overview. Furthermore, the document explicitly mentions the objector's related FOI request for documents concerning their initial objection to the David Pocock party's registration, reinforcing the interconnectedness of these administrative challenges to AEC processes."

Do not include any conversational filler or preamble.To aid you, the overview of the FOI request is: [REQUEST OVERVIEW START] The FOI request (LEX3070) sought applications made to the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) under s 141(2) of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 during early 2022, concerning reviews of party registration and deregistration decisions. The released documents, primarily communications and a detailed statistical analysis, reveal a strong theme of challenges to the AEC's administrative processes. Key content includes multiple parties (e.g., Democratic Labour Party, Flux, Health Australia Party) arguing that the AEC's party membership verification methodology is statistically flawed, unfair, and results in arbitrary deregistration outcomes, with Flux providing extensive analysis asserting the method is \"rigged.\" Additional challenges include the Australian Progressives alleging a clerical error in their deregistration, an objection to the registration of the David Pocock party based on candidate eligibility and name consistency, and an objection to the Australian Federation Party's logo for potential voter confusion.\n [REQUEST OVERVIEW END] \n\n--- MAIN DOCUMENT TEXT START ---\n\n\n\n--- Page 1 ---\n\nFrom:\nSent:\nTo:\nSubject:\n\nMonday, 11 April 2022 8:04 AM\nCommission Secretariat; FAD\nrequest for internal review\n\nFollow Up Flag:\nFlag Status:\n\nFollow up\nCompleted\n\nCAUTION: This email originated from outside of the Australian Federal Government. Do not click links or open \nattachments unless you recognise the sender and know the content is safe. \n\nTO \n\nMr Tom Rogers Australian Electoral Commissioner \n\nDear Mr Rogers \n\nThank you for the email notifying me of the decision dated 18 March 2022 to register the David Pocock \nparty. \n\nI \n\n of \n\n seek internal review of the decision. \n\nI note that I have made an FOI request for all documents relating to consideration of my objection to the \ndecision to register the David Pock Party. I believe those documents may inform my internal review \nrequest.  \n\nI am conscious of the public interest in resolving this matter quickly and I have requested expeditious \nprocessing of my FOI application. I had hoped that the AEC would recognise the public interest in speedy \nresolution of internal review requests and would process the related FOI request speedily. I am therefore \ndisappointed that my FOI request has still not been determined.  I seek your agreement to my \nsupplementing this internal review request when the response to my FOI application is received. \n\nIt is apparent from reading the decision to register the David Pocock Party that the decision-maker has \ntaken an extraordinarily narrow approach to statutory interpretation. The decision-maker has followed a \n‘ticking boxes’ approach without consideration of the scheme of the legislation or its purpose. Also, \nnotwithstanding a heading ‘Findings of Fact and Consideration’ the decision-maker has failed to make a \nfinding of fact in relation to a key factual issue raised in the objections.  \n\nIt follows that the decision is fundamentally flawed. \n\nTwo key issues were raised in the objections to the application to register the David Pocock Party. \n\nIssue (1)-that at the time of the application for registration it was clear from interviews published in the \nmedia including in the major ACT daily newspaper the Canberra Times that Mr David Pocock has publicly \nadmitted that he was a citizen of a foreign country, Zimbabwe, and therefore ineligible for the Senate. \n\nThis public admission is a serious question of fact. \n\n1\n\nLEX3070 Released Document No. 81019Released under the Freedom of Information Act 1982\n\n\n--- Page 2 ---\n\n31. \n\n32. \n\n33. \n\n34. \n\n35. \n\n36. \n\n37. \n\n38. \n\nBusiness information (information having a commercial value that would be, \nor could reasonably be expected to be, destroyed or diminished if the \ninformation were disclosed). \n\nLegal Professional Communication redacted. \n\nDeliberative material redacted. \n\nElectoral Roll material redacted. \n\nTests, examinations or audits material redacted. \n\nManagement or assessment of personnel material redacted. \n\nProper and efficient conduct of the operations of AEC material redacted. \n\nLawful methods or procedures for preventing, detecting, investigating, or \ndealing with matters arising out of, breaches or evasions of the law redactged \n\n39. \n\nIrrelevant material redacted.\n\n\n--- Page 3 ---\n\nThe decision-maker has failed to make a relevant finding of fact.  \n\nIt was necessary for the decision-maker first to make a relevant finding of fact relating to matters raised in \nthe objections then to set out reasons in relation to the legal significance of that finding of fact. \n\nThe purpose of registration is to enable ‘above the line’ voting. Registration that would facilitate ‘election’ \nof a candidate not lawfully eligible would clearly be contrary to the scheme of the Act. \n\nThe AEC will be aware that before the last election the AEC failed to establish proper eligibility procedures, \nas a result of this procedural failure on the part of the AEC persons who were ineligible nominated, \nelection of a number of persons were subsequently overturned by the High Court on the foreign \ncitizenship issue. Some regard the AEC as having failed properly to perform its functions eg properly \ndrawing attention to the legal requirements to be eligible to nominate. \n\nThe AEC should not in effect mislead the Australian public by registering as a party the name of a person \nwho at the time of the application for registration on his own admission was not eligible for election. \n\nI emphasise that my submission is not that the AEC should itself determine eligibility. That is not the AEC’s \nfunction. My submission is that, Mr Pocock having publicly admitted that he was a citizen of Zimbabwe, \nthe AEC should not have ignored the consequences when determining the registration application. \n\nAs a minimum, having regard to Mr Pocock’s public admission that he was a citizen of Zimbabwe, and \nhaving regard to objections raising this issue, certain consequences should have been followed. \n\nThe AEC and the decision-maker should have found as a fact that Mr Pocock had publicly admitted that he \nwas a citizen of Zimbabwe.  \nThe AEC and the decision-maker should also have found as a fact that objections had been made on this \nground. \n\nThe AEC should then have considered the implications of its findings of fact,  in particular, the AEC should \nhave drawn Mr Pocock’s attention to the eligibility requirements and drawn his attention to the standard \nqualification check list for candidates. \n\nAlso, as the fact of Mr Pocock’s public admission that he was a citizen of Zimbabwe was raised in the \nobjections, this should not have been ignored in the decision-maker’s finding of facts. The decision-maker \nsimply failed to make a relevant finding of fact. \n\nThe AEC should not register as a party the name of a person who on his own admission is a citizen \nof  foreign country and therefore ineligible. The significance of registration of a name of a person who is \ninedible cannot just be ignored. \n\nThe application can easily be cured by the applicant himself by lodging a fresh application if and when Mr \nPocock has terminated citizenship of a foreign country and become eligible for election. \n\nThis issue is not to be resolved not by ‘ticking boxes’ but by proper consideration of the scheme of the Act \nand the purposes and consequences of registration. On this correct approach to statutory interpretation, it \nis abundantly clear that registration of the name of a person who, on his own admission, and as drawn to \nattention in the objections to registration, is a citizen of a foreign country and therefore is ineligible, is \ncontrary to the scheme of the Act and the consequences of registration. \n\nIt follows that the application must be rejected. \n\n2\n\nLEX3070 Released Document No. 8Released under the Freedom of Information Act 1982\n\n\n--- Page 4 ---\n\nIssue (2) The proposed name ‘David Pocock’ is not consistent with the concept of a party. \n\nThe reasons for this objection are set out in more detail in the decision-maker’s summary of objections \nfrom Ernst, Neil and Lis. I adopt all those reasons in this objection-I think it is unnecessary to set them out \nin detail again but I ask that the AEC reviewer take account of all those reasons as summarised in the \ndecision. \n\nAgain the decision-maker has adopted a ‘ticking boxes’ approach without understanding the scheme and \npurpose of the Act. \n\nIt must surely be obvious that an application to be registered as a party must satisfy the legal concept of \n‘party’. To explain this by analogy, if seeking to register a motor vehicle it is not possible to register a cat, \nbecause a cat is not a motor vehicle. Similarly, to register a party there must be something that satisfies \nthe legal concept of a party. As a matter of common sense, a single person or the name of a person does \nnot constitute a party. A party simply put is a body of persons united in some sort of cause or opinion or \notherwise engaged together. These matters have been set out in greater length in the objections from \nErnst, Neil and Lis set out in the decision. A party may incorporate the name of a person, so, for example, \n‘David Pocock for Canberra’ would satisfy the party concept. \n\nThe error in the decision can be illustrated by drawing attention to the consequences for the ballot paper.  \n\nIf the application were allowed to stand the ballot paper would have David Pocock above the line, as a \nname.  \n\nElectors wishing to vote ‘below the line’ would also find the name David Pocock below the line. \n\nSurely this outcome would be perverse. Surely the scheme object and purpose of the Act envisage that the \nidentification ‘above the line’ must be different from the name that appears below the line.  \n\nThe consequential confusion and uncertainty is obvious. Some electors may tick David Pocock boxes both \nabove and below the line, some may be confused about how to allocate preferences and so on.  \n\nIn short, what appears above the line and what appears below the line must surely be different. A party \nmust be different from and more than just a name. \n\nI add that it is arguable that this outcome would give Mr Pocock an unfair advantage over other \ncandidates, his name and his name on its own would appear twice on the ballot paper. \n\nThe decision-maker has failed to have regard to the scheme of the Act and the consequences for the ballot \npaper. \n\nThis difficulty can readily be rectified. It is not for objectors to assist the applicant on how to rectify the \ndefect but just to show how easy the defect could be remedied I suggest that a party name along the lines \nof the proposed logo would suffice.  \n\nIt follows that the application must be rejected. The applicant should be invited to submit a fresh \napplication with an appropriate party name. \n\nYours sincerely \n\n3\n\nLEX3070 Released Document No. 8Released under the Freedom of Information Act 1982\n\n\n--- Page 5 ---\n\n11 April 2022 \n\n4\n\nLEX3070 Released Document No. 81Released under the Freedom of Information Act 1982\n\n\n--- Page 6 ---\n\n1. \n\n2. \n\n3. \n\n4. \n\n5. \n\n6. \n\n7. \n\n8. \n\n9. \n\n10. \n\n11. \n\n12. \n\n13. \n\n14. \n\n15. \n\n16. \n\n17. \n\n18. \n\n19. \n\n20. \n\n21. \n\n22. \n\n23. \n\n24. \n\n25. \n\n26. \n\n27. \n\n28. \n\n29. \n\nREDACTION CODES \n\nPersonal Information (name) redacted. \n\nPersonal Information (date of birth) redacted. \n\nPersonal Information (place of birth) redacted \n\nPersonal Information (citizenship) redacted. \n\nPersonal Information (racial or ethnic origin) redacted. \n\nPersonal Information (photograph) redacted \n\nPersonal Information (facsimile of signature) redacted. \n\nPersonal Information (facsimile of manuscript initialling) redacted. \n\nPersonal Information (Individual’s address) redacted. \n\nPersonal Information (Individual’s email address) redacted. \n\nPersonal Information (individual’s telephone number or mobile number) \nredacted. \n\nPersonal Information (individual’s political opinion) redacted. \n\nPersonal Information (opinion about individual) redacted. \n\nPersonal Information (Individuals current or former occupation). \n\nPersonal Information (employment history) redacted. \n\nPersonal Information (qualifications) redacted. \n\nPersonal Information (membership of a professional or trade association). \n\nPersonal Information (membership of a trade union). \n\nPersonal Information (health) redacted. \n\nPersonal Information (membership of a political association) redacted \n\nPersonal Information (religious beliefs or affiliations) redacted. \n\nPersonal Information (sexual orientation or practices). \n\nPersonal Information (criminal record). \n\nPersonal Information (identifying individual) redacted. \n\nPersonal Information (bank account details) redacted) \n\nBusiness information (bank account details) redacted. \n\nBusiness information (billing account details) redacted. \n\nBusiness information (ureasonably affect a person adversely in respect of his \nor her lawful business or professional affairs) redacted. \n\nBusiness Information (reasonably be expected to prejudice the future supply \nof information to the Commonwealth or an agency for the purpose of the \nadministration of a law of the Commonwealth or of a Territory or the \nadministration of matters administered by an agency). \n\n30. \n\nBusiness information (trade secret).\n\n"
