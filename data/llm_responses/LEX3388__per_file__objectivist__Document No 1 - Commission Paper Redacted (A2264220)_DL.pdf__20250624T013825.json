            "text": "The document is an internal Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) review and recommendation concerning the deregistration of VOTEFLUX.ORG | Upgrade Democracy! It details the AEC's methodology for verifying political party membership, the results of two membership tests for VOTEFLUX, arguments raised by the party challenging the process, and the Commission’s considerations leading to a final recommendation. The core issue is whether VOTEFLUX.ORG demonstrably holds the statutory minimum of 1,500 members. The document reveals that VOTEFLUX submitted an initial list of 1,649 members, which failed the AEC's test. A second list of 4,680 members was submitted, but the AEC delegate arbitrarily selected only the \"top 1,650 names\" for testing, which also failed. Critically, the AEC's own Chief Methodologist from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) advised that this \"top 1,650\" approach for the second list was statistically invalid for drawing conclusions about the party's *entire* 4,680-member list, due to lack of randomization. Despite this internal admission of methodological flaw, the document recommends affirming the deregistration, citing the failure of the first test, the lack of a *compliant* subsequent list (i.e., between 1,500-1,650 names), and balancing the \"defensible process\" against \"reasonable use of Commonwealth resources.\"\n\nWithin the context of the FOI request, this document serves as a stark illustration of government overreach and a direct assault on individual rights and productive achievement from an Objectivist perspective. The AEC's actions, as documented here, embody a profound disregard for objective reality and reason, while actively suppressing individual initiative and free association under the guise of bureaucratic convenience.\n\n**Analysis from an Objectivist Perspective:**\n\n1.  **Reason:**\n    *   **Contradiction and Disregard for Reality:** The document fundamentally contradicts the value of reason. The AEC's own expert, Mr. Anders Holmberg (ABS Chief Methodologist), explicitly states that the delegate’s decision to test only the \"top 1,650 names\" from VOTEFLUX’s 4,680-member list was flawed, rendering it impossible to \"draw any statistical conclusions about the entire list\" (6.7). This is an undeniable admission of an irrational, statistically invalid process. Yet, despite this, the document proceeds to affirm the deregistration. This demonstrates a profound abandonment of objective truth and logical inference in favor of a predetermined outcome or bureaucratic inertia.\n    *   **Arbitrary Limits:** The policy of requiring a list of \"between 1,500 to 1,650 names\" (4.2, 6.6) is arbitrary and divorced from reality, especially when a party demonstrates \"excess capacity\" by submitting a significantly larger list (4,680 names). Reason dictates that if a party can demonstrate *more* than the required number of members, this should be accepted as proof, rather than subjecting them to an unnecessarily restrictive and statistically invalid sampling process.\n    *   **Prioritization of Expediency over Truth:** The document explicitly states that the methodology is a \"compromise between a defensible process and a reasonable use of Commonwealth resources\" (6.26). This is an explicit admission that rational, defensible (i.e., objective and accurate) methods are being deliberately curtailed for the sake of administrative \"timeliness\" and \"resources\" (4.4, 6.15). This represents a clear sacrifice of reason and truth to bureaucratic expediency, antithetical to Objectivist principles.\n\n2.  **Individualism:**\n    *   **Suppression of Individual Initiative and Free Association:** VOTEFLUX's effort to accrue 4,680 members represents a significant productive achievement and a robust exercise of the right to free association. The AEC’s arbitrary refusal to properly test this larger list, or even acknowledge its existence beyond a \"limited persuasive value\" (6.11), actively punishes this success. Instead of celebrating a vibrant example of citizen engagement, the bureaucracy erects obstacles that disincentivize productive effort and stifle the legitimate expression of individual political will.\n    *   **Individuals as Means to Bureaucratic Ends:** The entire process treats individual members and the party's collective efforts as mere data points to be processed (or rejected) according to the AEC's internal, convenience-driven rules, rather than recognizing them as sovereign entities with a right to political participation. The lack of transparency regarding feedback on membership confirmations/denials (6.22) further disempowers individuals and the party, denying them the information needed to understand or correct issues, thus reinforcing the state's control over their legitimate actions.\n\n3.  **Free Enterprise:**\n    *   **Suppression of Productive Achievement:** While VOTEFLUX is not a commercial enterprise, its activities (member recruitment, political organization) represent productive achievement in the realm of ideas and voluntary association. The AEC's actions, particularly its refusal to properly evaluate a large membership list due to \"resources,\" function as a state-imposed barrier to \"entry\" or continued operation in the \"market\" of political ideas. This stifles innovation and competition in the political sphere by prioritizing the \"costs\" of state administration over the value created by citizens.\n    *   **Bureaucratic Obstacles and \"Costs\" Over Value:** The emphasis on \"reasonable use of Commonwealth resources\" (6.26) as a justification for a demonstrably flawed methodology is a classic example of bureaucratic thinking prioritizing internal \"cost savings\" over objective reality and the value generated by productive citizens. It's an implicit claim that the state’s administrative burden outweighs the freedom of association and political self-determination of individuals.\n\n**Evidence of Bureaucratic Obstacles, Forced Altruism, or Suppression of Productive Achievement:**\n\n*   **Bureaucratic Obstacles:**\n    *   The arbitrary limit of 1,500-1,650 names for submission, despite a party having more members, creates unnecessary friction (4.2, 6.6).\n    *   The delegate's decision to take the \"top 1,650 names\" for testing the second list instead of randomizing the *entire* 4,680-name list, and the subsequent admission by the ABS Chief Methodologist that this approach provides no valid statistical conclusion about the overall list, highlights a fundamental bureaucratic inefficiency and disregard for sound method (6.7, 6.8).\n    *   The stated inability to test a larger list due to \"significant increase in resources\" (6.15) and the \"compromise\" between a \"defensible process\" and \"reasonable use of Commonwealth resources\" (6.26) explicitly confirm that bureaucratic convenience is prioritized over accurate verification.\n*   **Forced Altruism:**\n    *   The \"compromise\" means VOTEFLUX (and its members) are effectively compelled to sacrifice the accurate validation of their productive achievement (4,680 members) for the \"greater good\" of the AEC's administrative \"timeliness\" and \"resource\" allocation. This is a form of forced altruism, where the individual's rights and efforts are subjugated to the state's convenience.\n*   **Suppression of Productive Achievement:**\n    *   VOTEFLUX's success in accruing over 4,000 members is not only unacknowledged as a positive indicator but is actively undermined by the AEC's refusal to test the full list properly. This disincentivizes \"excess capacity\" and political dynamism, suggesting that productive achievement beyond arbitrary bureaucratic thresholds is a burden, not a benefit (6.25, 6.26).\n    *   The continued recommendation for deregistration despite the acknowledged flaws in the testing of the larger list (7.1) directly suppresses VOTEFLUX's political activity and its members' right to organize."

The AEC's use of a demonstrably flawed and irrational membership testing methodology, despite internal expert admission of its statistical invalidity, constitutes a profound disregard for objective reality and reason—foundations essential for personal freedom and a just society. By arbitrarily limiting and rejecting VOTEFLUX's significant productive efforts in accruing members, the AEC actively suppresses individual initiative and disincentivizes rational self-interest, effectively punishing excellence and forcing stagnation under the guise of bureaucratic \"convenience.\" This prioritization of administrative \"costs\" over truth and liberty exemplifies the dangers of collectivism, where the individual is sacrificed for the arbitrary will of the state, thereby stifling the free association and productive endeavors of citizens and undermining the proper role of government as a protector of rights.\n [REQUEST OVERVIEW END] \n\n--- MAIN DOCUMENT TEXT START ---\n\n\n\n--- Page 1 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 2 ---\n\nTable of Contents \n1.

Section 137(1) provides that the Commission (or delegate in this case) must give the \nparty a notice that it is considering deregistering the party, if the delegate is satisfied on \nreasonable grounds that: \n\n(b) a political party… not being a Parliamentary party, does not have at least \n1,500 members \n\n4.4.  Where,  as  occurred  here,  the  party  provides  a  statement  in  response  to  the  notice, \ns 137(5) provides that the delegate ‘shall consider that statement and determine whether \nthe  political  party  should  be  deregistered  for  the  reason  set  out  in  that  notice’.  The \ndelegate’s decision to deregister the party under s 137(6) is a reviewable decision. \n\n4.5.  The question for the Commission is whether, in the Commission’s view the Party should \nbe deregistered for the reason set out in the s 137(1) notice. The key issue is whether \nthe Commission is satisfied on reasonable grounds that the Party does not have at least \n1500 members.   \n\nDelegation of relevant powers \n\n4.6.  Under  s  16,  the  Commission  may,  by  resolution,  delegate  to  an  appointed \nCommissioner, an electoral officer or a member of the staff of the Commission all or any \nof its powers under the Electoral Act (other than its powers under Part IV).  \n\n4.7.  Relevant powers of the Commission in s 137 have been exercised by a delegate of the \nCommission. In similar circumstances, Liberal Democratic Party and Australian Electoral \nCommission  [2021]  AATA  4884  (21 December 2021)  Justice  Thawley  stated  in  his \nreasons for decision that he was satisfied that Ms Reid was acting as the delegate of \nthe  Commission  under  s 16(1)  and  that  the  terms  of  the  delegation,  dated  29  March \n2019, cover the decision that Ms Reid made. \n\nInternal review of a delegate’s deregistration decision  \n\n4.8.  A  decision  to  deregister  a  political  party  under  s  137(6)  is  a  reviewable  decision  as \n\ndefined in s 141(1). \n\n4.9.  An application for review under s 141(2) must: \n\n• \n\n• \n\n• \n\n• \n\nbe  made  within  the  period  of  28  days  after  the  day  on  which  the  decision  first \ncomes to the notice of the person, or within such further period as the Commission \n(either before or after the expiration of that period) allows; \n\nbe made in writing to the Electoral Commission;  \n\nspecify an address of the applicant; and  \n\ninclude reasons for making the application (s 141(3)).  \n\n4.10. The  time  period  and  meaning  of  the  ‘person  affected’  as  stipulated  by  s  141(2)  was \naddressed earlier in this paper. The requirements of s 141(2) are otherwise addressed \nby the application. \n\n4.11. Under s 141(4), upon receipt of an application for review, the Commission must review \n\nthe delegate’s decision and either: \n\n• \n\n• \n\naffirm the decision; \n\nvary the decision; or  \n\nPage 6 of 15\n\n\n--- Page 7 ---\n\n• \n\nset aside the decision and make a decision in substitution. \n\n4.12. It is open to the Commission to consider the facts and circumstances present at the date \nof its review decision (see Shi v Migration Agents Registration Authority (2008) 235 CLR \n286). \n\n4. Methodology \n4.1. This  section  sets  out  the  current  position  taken  by  the  Commission  to  testing  party \n\nmembership and the steps taken by the delegate. \n\nParty membership testing methodology \n\n4.2. In short, and as set out in Appendix 2 of the AEC’s public guidance ‘Guide for registering \na party’, the AEC requires parties to submit a membership list of between 1500 to 1650 \nnames (regardless of whether the party actually has a list with more names). After filtering \nout the names of individuals who are not on the electoral roll and those who are already \nsupporting the registration of another political party, the AEC contacts a random sample \nof  individuals  named  on  the  list to  confirm  whether  they  are members  of  the  party (for \ndetails  of  this  methodology  and  process  see  Attachment J).  The  sample  size  and \nmaximum number of denials permitted is based on a formula developed by the ABS and \nendorsed by the Commission.  \n\n4.3. The current methodology for testing party membership was finalised and endorsed by the \nCommission in October 2021, having been updated after amendments to the Electoral \nAct  by  the  Electoral  Legislation  Amendment  (Party  Registration  Integrity)  Act  2021 \nincreased the  membership  requirements  for  non-Parliamentary  party  from  at  least  500 \nmembers to at least 1500 members (Attachment K).   \n\n4.4. The  goals  of  the  methodology  are  set  out  in  the  attached  paper  endorsed  by  the \nCommission  on  20 March  2016  and  include  ensuring  that  ‘timeliness  for  undertaking \nmembership testing remain reasonable’ (Attachment L). \n\n4.5. As  set  out  in  the  membership  testing  table  provided  by  the  ABS  (extract  at \nAttachment M), when used appropriately, the testing methodology is calibrated so that \nthe probability of rejecting a valid list is less than 6% and the probability of accepting an \ninvalid list is less than 2%. \n\nFirst Membership list of 7 December 2021 \n\n4.6. On 8 October 2021, a delegate of the Commission wrote to the Party to request that they \nsubmit  a  membership  list  of  between  1500-1650  names  (Attachment N).  The  first \nmembership  list  provided  by  the  Party  on  7  December  2022  contained  1649  names \n(Attachment O).  This  list  failed  to  satisfy  the  delegate  that  they  had  at  least  1500 \nmembers, on the grounds that it failed to pass the testing parameters. Following matching \nand removal of duplicates the results of that testing were: \n\nPage 7 of 15\n\n\n--- Page 8 ---\n\n4.7. On the basis of that test the delegate was satisfied that the Party did not have at least \n1500 members. The delegate issued the party with a notice under s 137(1) on 13 January \n2022, stating that they were considering deregistering the Party and provided them with \nanother opportunity to provide a statement under s 137(2) as to why they should not be \nderegistered (Attachment P). \n\nSecond membership list of 13 February 2022 \n\n4.8. On  13  February  2022,  the  Party  provided  a  statement  and  a  second  membership  list \nwhich contained 4,680 names (Attachment Q). This list contained more names than the \nmaximum 1650 as set out in the AEC’s policy (see Attachment J for the publicly available \npolicy). The party submitted that the list of names was evidence that the Party had at least \nthe required number of 1500 members. The Party also levelled various challenges against \nthe testing methodology. \n\n4.9. The delegate instructed the AEC to select the top 1650 names for testing (Attachment R). \nOnce  these  initial  exclusions  were  applied,  this  sub-list  contained  1,586  names \n(Attachment S).  \n\n4.10.  The results of testing of the sub-list are as summarised follows (Attachment S): \n\n4.11.  The delegate considered the Party’s submissions and determined at [30] of her  reasons \nthat  ‘the  membership  testing  results  outlined  above  provide  a  more  robust  method  for \nascertaining whether a party has satisfied the requirements of the Electoral Act than a \nstatement provided by the party’ (at Attachment B). \n\n4.12.  The delegate remained satisfied that the Party did not have at least 1500 members and \ndetermined that the Party was not an ‘eligible political party’ and should be deregistered.  \n\nFurther contact with Party by Commission Secretariat.  \n\n4.13.  The Party has been provided with the opportunity to make further statements or provide \nadditional evidence to establish that they meet the requirements for registration.  \n\n4.14.  The Party has not provided to the Commission an updated party membership testing list \n\nor any other such evidence for processing. The Commission Secretariat wrote to \nrequesting  any  further  evidence  including  a  membership  list  compliant  with  the  policy \n did not respond to this request. The Commission Secretariat \n(Attachment T). \nwrote to the former registered officer of the Party on 29 June 2022 inviting him to make \nany  submissions  in  relation  to  the review  (Attachment U).  No  submissions  have  been \nreceived.  \n\n5. Arguments raised in Applications for Review \n\nApplication by \n\n5.3. \n\nIn support of the applications for review, the application of \nmakes the following relevant arguments: \n\n (Attachment C) \n\nPage 8 of 15 \n\ns 47F (Personal Privacys 47F (Personal Privacy)s 47F (Personal Privacy)s 47F (Personal Privacy)\n\n\n--- Page 9 ---\n\n• \n\n• \n\n• \n\n• \n\nThe AEC’s failure rate or probability of rejecting a valid list is quite high, in some \ncases as high as 99%. The delegate’s decision in this instance to take the top \n1650 names from the list of around 4000, instead of randomising the list of names, \nis unfair. \n\nThe filtering of members with no replacement for those that are not matched to \nthe Roll (or otherwise excluded) increases the rates of false negatives.  \n\nThe  AEC  does  not  provide  parties  with  a  list  of  which  members  were  filed  or \nremoved,  nor  does  it  provide  data  on  which  individuals  confirmed/denied \nmembership. \n\nThe AEC’s methodology assumes that the list of members provided are the only \nmembers of the party and ignores any ‘excess capacity’ of the party. \n\nApplication of \n\n5.4.  The application for review of \n\n (Attachment D) can be summarised as follows: \n\n• \n\n• \n\n• \n\nRequests  for  further  information  relating  to  which  party  members  confirmed  or \ndenied  the  membership  testing  (including  his  own  answer)  and  details  of  the \ntimeframe for response given to members. \n\nA request for a review of the ‘statistical’ method used in relation to the ‘top’ 1650 \nnames being taken, and whether this resulted in any errors. \n\nA request for the AEC to provide the mathematical proof of the sampling method \nused,  and  to  review  the  method  and  determine  the  rate  at  which  this  method \nwould return a false negative. \n\n5.5. \n\nrequests for further information are not relevant to the current decision \n\nunder review.  \n\n5.6.  The issue of the ‘top’ 1650 names being taken as opposed to a random sample have \nbeen addressed elsewhere in this paper. Similarly, the rate at which a false negative \nis produced has also been addressed (see section 6 below). \n\n6. Issues for Consideration  \n\nReasonable grounds  \n\n6.3.  The Commission must be satisfied on ‘reasonable grounds’ that a Party does not have \n\n1500 members prior to making a decision (s 137(1)(a)).  \n\n6.4.  The  Party  submitted  two  membership  lists  for  testing,  one  on  7  December  2021 \ncomprising 1649 names and a second list on 13 February 2022 with 4680 names.  \n\n6.5.  The AEC conducted the party membership testing for the first list in accordance with the \nmethodology  provided  by  the  ABS  and  as  endorsed  by  the  Commission  (see \nAttachment V for the results of testing for the first membership list and Attachment S \nfor the results of testing for the second membership list).  \n\n6.6.  There  was  a  departure  from  the  methodology  with  respect  to  the  second  list.  The \nmethodology assumes that a list will be between 1500 to 1650 members. The Guide to \nRegistering a Party sets out the methodology and process, even though, in this case the \napplication of testing procedures is to a party already registered. Page 16 of the Guide \nto Registering a Party (Attachment J) provides that  \n\nThe  AEC  requires  a  party  to  choose  a  maximum  of  1,650  members  for  the \nmembership  list  included  with  their  application.  The  AEC  will  return  a \n\nPage 9 of 15 \n\ns 47F (Personal Privacy)s 47F (Personal Privacy)s 47F (Personal Privacy)\n\n\n--- Page 10 ---\n\nmembership list in excess of 1,650 members and ask the party to lodge \nthe membership list with between 1,500 and 1,650 members. \n\n(emphasis added) \n\n6.7.  The delegate’s approach was to select the top 1650 names on that list for testing. As a \nresult of non-randomisation and the small sample size, Mr Anders Holmberg, ABS Chief \nMethodologist has advised that it is only possible to use the results of that test to say \nsomething  about  the  selected  1650  names  in  the  sub-list  (Attachment W).  The  test \ndone indicates a list with low proportion of eligible members among those 1,650 names. \nIt is not possible to draw any statistical conclusions about the entire list of 4,680 names \nfrom the results of testing the sub-list. This is because, without randomisation there is \nno chance of the other records being selected.  \n\n6.8.  Mr Holmberg explained this with the example of attempting to sample from a deck of \ncards for aces. Having failed to first shuffle the deck, chunking the bottom half away, \nand  then  sampling  from  what  is  left  will  not  provide  useful  information  about  all  the \noriginal cards. Those thrown away were never in the running.  \n\n6.9.  Furthermore,  to  achieve  the  desired  probability  adopted  by  the  Commission  in  the \nmethodology of a false rejection rate of 6% or less and a false acceptance rate of 2% of \nless,  would  require  an  approximate  sample  size  of  564  and  a  maximum  number  of \ndenials allowed of 399.  \n\n6.10. Accordingly,  in  deciding  whether  it  is  satisfied  that  the  Party  does  not  have  1500 \nmembers  the  Commission  should  accord  limited  weight to the result  of that test.  The \nCommission should also consider whether the list of 4680 names and the submissions \nof the applicants lead the Commission to conclude that it is cannot be satisfied that the \nparty does not have 1500 members.  \n\n6.11. It is recommended that the Commission can be satisfied on ‘reasonable grounds’ that \n\nthe party does not have 1500 members for the following reasons: \n\n• \n\n• \n\n• \n\n• \n\n• \n\nThe first membership test failed. \n\nNo list submitted by the party has passed a membership test.  \n\nThe party has not supplied any subsequent list of between 1500-1,650 members \nor  further  evidence  as  requested  despite  prompting  by  the  Commission \nSecretariat (see Attachments T and U). \n\nA list of untested members, by itself, is of only limited persuasive value. \n\nFor the reasons set out below the other arguments made by the applicants are \nnot persuasive. \n\nFailure rate & selection of top 1650 names rather than randomisation \n\n6.12. \n\n argues that there are particular problems with the second membership test. He \nargues that the failure rate or probability of rejecting a valid list is quite high, in some \ncases as high as 99%, and that it was an error for the delegate to draw only the ‘top’ \n1650 names consisting of names starting from A to G.  \n\n6.13. He argues that: \n\n‘Which of these tests should we believe to be true?.... That Flux has fewer than \n1,500 members; or That Flux has fewer than 1,500 members whose first name \nstarts with one of A through G.’ (see Attachment C at page 4)  \n\n6.14. As  set  out  above,  Mr  Anders  Holmberg,  ABS  Chief  Methodologist,  advises  that  the \nCommission should not seek to draw a conclusion from the testing of the sub-list that \nthe second list does not contain 1500 members.  \n\nPage 10 of 15 \n\ns 47F (Personal Privacy\n\n\n--- Page 11 ---\n\n6.15. For the Commission to test the second list of 4680 members in a way that ensures the \nprobability of rejecting a valid list and accepting an invalid list are less than 6%, would \nrequire  randomly sampling  564  members  based  on  the  ABS  calculations.  This  would \nrequire  a  significant  increase  in  resources  given  that  current  maximum  sample  size \nwould  be  from  a  list  of  1650  members  and  would  require  sampling  60  people \n(Appendix 2 of the Guide to Registering a Party).  \n\n6.16. Ultimately, it is not necessary to engage in detail with the statistical arguments made by \n which start with the assumption that the Party has at least 1500 members and \nthen seek to prove that a particular list could have been rejected. The Commission need \nonly place limited weight on the results of the testing of the sub-list.  \n\nFiltering of names \n\n6.17. \n\n makes submissions that the filtering of names increases the error rate. He \nsubmits  that  ‘as  more  members  are  filtered  without  replacement,  the  false  negative \nrate increases dramatically’ (see Attachment C at page 8). \n\n6.18. This submission can be rejected. The ABS methodology requires that once a party has \nsubmitted a list of names to be tested for membership, the AEC filters out names that \ncannot be counted towards the number of members of the party.  \n\n6.19. The following individuals are excluded prior to testing begins: \n\n• \n\n• \n\n• \n\ndual members of parties (i.e. a person cannot be relied upon for the membership \nof two parties), and \n\nindividuals who cannot be matched to the electoral roll and individuals who are \ndeceased \n\nduplicates (i.e. individuals who appear more than once on the list). \n\n6.20. Once there is a list with at least 1500 names who have been matched to the Roll, the \nsampling/testing process begins. The membership testing sample size and maximum \nnumber of denials permitted is calculated after the list of names have been filtered, and \nnot before. The sample size is calculated relative to this figure of post-filtered names. It \nis therefore not possible that the false negative rate increases as the number of names \nfiltered out increases. \n\nNo feedback provided  \n\n6.21. \n\n and \n\n take issue with the fact that the AEC does not provide parties \nwith a list of which individuals denied membership of the party, nor does it inform parties \nwhich individuals confirmed/denied membership. \n\n6.22.  The  AEC  does  not  provide  parties  with  any  detailed  feedback from  the  testing,  aside \nfrom the number of denials/confirmations that were received. The purpose of the testing \nis  to  establish  to  the  AEC’s  satisfaction  whether  a  party  has  the  requisite  number  of \nmembers. Providing feedback to parties does not aid this purpose and the AEC is not \nrequired  to  provide  feedback  by  the  legislation.  Aside  from  practical  considerations, \nthere would need to be careful consideration given to releasing this information under \nthe Privacy Act 1986 (Cth). \n\n6.23.  In  any  event,  this  submission  would  not  appear  to  affect  whether  the  Commission  is \n\nsatisfied that the party has at least 1500 members.  \n\nPage 11 of 15 \n\ns 47F (Personal Privacys 47F (Personal Privacys 47F (Personal Privacy\n\n\n--- Page 12 ---\n\n6.24. \n\n  requests  information  about  whether  his  confirmation  of  membership  was \ncorrectly recorded. Whilst it is likely to have little effect on the Commission’s decision, \ndata provided by Services Australia shows his confirmation being received and recorded \n(Attachment X at line 54). He also requests information about how long members are \ngiven to respond to a request. As set out above, consistent with the testing methodology, \nif  an  individual  failed to respond  within  a  period of time,  Services  Australia  would  not \nhave treated the response as a denial but would have attempted contact with another \nperson so as to complete the sample.   \n\n‘Excess capacity’  \n\n6.25. \n\n argues that the assumption built into the membership testing process is that \nthe number of names submitted are the only members of the party. This is referred to \n as the ‘excess capacity’ argument. If parties were allowed to submit larger \nby \nlists, then there is an increased likelihood of ‘at least’ 1500 members being found and \nthe party passing its party membership testing.  \n\n6.26. As set out above, to achieve the same level of confidence that the party’s list of 4680 \nmembers does not contain 1500 members would require the Commission to sample 564 \nmembers. As acknowledged in the Commission Paper endorsing the methodology (see \nAttachment L), the Commission’s adoption of the ABS methodology is a compromise \nbetween a defensible process and a reasonable use of Commonwealth resources.  \n\n6.27. One  factor  that  the  Commission  should  consider  is  whether  the  list  of  4680  itself \npersuades the Commission that the party has 1500 members. Given the relative ease \nwith which a list of individuals could be produced by the party, we think the fact that the \nparty has such a list needs to be balanced against the results of testing of the first list. \n\nPage 12 of 15 \n\ns 47F (Personal Privacy)s 47F (Personal Privacys 47F (Personal Privacy\n\n\n--- Page 13 ---\n\n7.
