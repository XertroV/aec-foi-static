            "text": "This document, a \"Request for Review of Decision\" by the Democratic Labour Party (DLP) to the Australian Electoral Commissioner, details a grievance against the Australian Electoral Commission's (AEC) decision to deregister the DLP. The DLP contends that the deregistration, ostensibly for failing to meet a 1500-member threshold, is based on a profoundly flawed and unfair process. Key complaints include alleged discriminatory treatment compared to other parties, denial of natural justice through restricted data submission and lack of clear communication, and the use of an irrationally small statistical sample (42 members from 1650 submitted names) to definitively assess membership, which the DLP argues is statistically invalid and procedurally unfair. The DLP asserts the AEC prioritized its own \"convenience\" over the party's right to democratic participation and that the Delegate's decision exhibits an \"apprehended bias.\" The party requests immediate re-registration and a re-assessment based on a newly submitted list of 1650 members.\n\nFrom an Objectivist perspective, this document serves as a powerful indictment of government overreach and the betrayal of fundamental values, echoing the concerns outlined in the FOI request overview.\n\n**Reason:** The AEC's actions demonstrate a profound contempt for reason. Its methodology, using a miniscule sample of 42 members to definitively invalidate a claim of 1500+ members, is statistically irrational and defies objective reality, as highlighted by the DLP's critique of its \"huge standard error.\" The AEC's justification—that it \"previously concluded that the methodology was appropriate\"—is a circular, self-serving appeal to authority rather than a reasoned defense of its methods. Furthermore, the AEC's inconsistent application of rules, allowing some parties to submit new lists without explicit permission while denying others who specifically sought it, reveals an arbitrary and illogical administrative process. The DLP, conversely, argues from a position of reason, demanding objective verification (contacting all members) and critiquing the AEC's irrational statistical and procedural choices.\n\n**Individualism:** The AEC's actions directly contradict individualism by stifling the voluntary, self-directed efforts of individuals to organize and participate in the political process. The arbitrary imposition of a membership threshold, coupled with irrational and inconsistently applied verification methods, serves as a barrier to free association and political competition. By denying the DLP the ability to properly demonstrate its membership, the AEC punishes the diligent, voluntary effort of its members to build a political movement, thereby undermining individual initiative and suppressing their right to pursue their political values. This transforms a supposed neutral administrator into an \"instrument of state control\" over individual political expression.\n\n**Free Enterprise:** While not directly a commercial enterprise, the political sphere can be viewed through the lens of free enterprise, where parties compete for public support. The AEC's actions operate as bureaucratic obstacles that distort this \"political marketplace.\" By imposing arbitrary limits on data submissions, denying essential information, and applying rules inconsistently, the AEC creates an unlevel playing field that suppresses competition and \"entrenches the political status quo.\" Deregistering a party based on irrational and unfair processes is akin to a government agency unfairly denying a business its license to operate, thereby stifling innovation, competition, and the natural emergence of new \"market\" entrants in the political landscape.\n\n**Evidence of Bureaucratic Obstacles:**\n*   **Arbitrary Limits and Denial of Data:** The restriction to submitting only 1650 names despite claiming more, and the denial of the opportunity to provide additional lists even after explicit requests, are clear bureaucratic impediments.\n*   **Inconsistent Application of Rules:** The most glaring obstacle is the AEC's differential treatment, where some parties were allowed to submit new lists without asking, while the DLP, which explicitly sought permission, was denied. This demonstrates a lack of objective, universal standards.\n*   **Prioritization of \"Convenience\" over Justice:** The document explicitly states that the AEC's \"convenience should not be the primary consideration\" when denying a party its right to participate in democratic processes, indicating a bureaucracy prioritizing its own ease of operation over fairness and individual rights.\n*   **Circular Justification:** The AEC's reliance on its own internal \"conclusion\" about the appropriateness of its methodology, rather than objective evidence or a robust defense, exemplifies bureaucratic insularity and resistance to external challenge.\n*   **Lack of Clear Communication:** The vague response to the DLP's question about submitting new lists (\"the statement can contain anything\") led to confusion and detriment, highlighting poor bureaucratic practice.\n\n**Evidence of Forced Altruism:**\nWhile not explicitly stating \"forced altruism,\" the document implies it through the imposition of the AEC's arbitrary will. The DLP is compelled to expend significant resources (time, effort, and the very existence of its organization) to fight against an irrational system imposed by the state. This forces the party to sacrifice its productive political achievement and its members' voluntary efforts, not for their own benefit, but to conform to the AEC's \"convenience\" and its arbitrarily defined \"integrity\" of the electoral system. This represents an unchosen burden, diverting resources from the party's actual purpose to serving the bureaucratic whims of the state.\n\n**Evidence of Suppression of Productive Achievement:**\n*   **Disregard for Effort:** The refusal to properly assess the DLP's submitted 1650 names, and the denial of the opportunity to provide more, directly suppresses the productive achievement of individuals who diligently organized and recruited members.\n*   **Deregistration as the Ultimate Suppression:** The ultimate consequence of the AEC's actions—the deregistration of the party—is the outright suppression of the productive achievement of forming, maintaining, and operating a political organization.\n*   **Stifling Political Competition:** By removing parties based on flawed processes, the AEC reduces competition and entrenches the existing political order, thereby stifling the productive pursuit of diverse political ideas and movements."

  "prompt": "From an Objectivist perspective, summarize this specific document within the context of the FOI request. Analyze how the document reflects or contradicts the values of reason, individualism, and free enterprise. Note any evidence of bureaucratic obstacles, forced altruism, or suppression of productive achievement.\n\nTo aid you, the overview of the FOI request is: [REQUEST OVERVIEW START] The Australian Electoral Commission's actions, as revealed in these FOI documents, represent a profound betrayal of individual rights and rational self-interest, serving as a stark example of government overreach that stifles productive achievement. Its demonstrably irrational methodologies for assessing party membership, which statistically ensure \"false negatives\" and arbitrary limits on submissions, actively punish the diligent, voluntary effort of individuals to organize and build political movements. This contempt for reason, evidenced by the AEC's dismissal of objective statistical analysis and its self-serving justifications, transforms it from a neutral administrator of objective law into an instrument of state control. Such paternalistic interference, including arbitrary restrictions on party identity and the denial of essential data, fundamentally undermines personal freedom, suppresses initiative and competition, and effectively entrenches the political status quo, thereby violating the principles of individual liberty and objective justice upon which a free society depends.\n [REQUEST OVERVIEW END] \n\n--- MAIN DOCUMENT TEXT START ---\n\n\n\n--- Page 1 ---\n\nPO Box 678 \nCivic Square \nACT 2608 \n\n31 March 2022 \n\nMr Tom Rogers \n Australian Electoral Commissioner \nLocked Bag 4007  \nCanberra City ACT 2601 \n\nBy email to: commission.secretariat@aec.gov.au \n\nDear Mr Rogers \n\nREQUEST FOR REVIEW OF DECISION \n\nPursuant to section 141(2) of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918, (the Electoral Act), we \nrequest a review of the decision on 4 March 2022 by the Delegate of the Commissioner, Joanne \nReid, to deregister the Democratic Labour Party (the DLP) under section 137(6)(a) of the Act. \n\nIn the first instance, it is of concern to us that amongst many small parties which have received \nNotices of Intent to Deregister, conservative Christian parties such as the DLP and the Christian \nDemocrats appear to have been singled out for quick deregistration while left-leaning secular \nparties such as “Derryn Hinch’s Justice Party” which also received similar notices months before \nthe DLP continue to be registered. It is also of great concern to us that we appear to have been \ndenied natural justice in our efforts to comply with the minimum 1500 member requirement by \nbeing restricted to only providing 1650 names, by having only a tiny sample of these being \ncontacted by the Electoral Commission and then finally by being denied the opportunity to \nprovide any additional lists of members.\n\n\n--- Page 2 ---\n\nOn 27 January 2022 we received a letter from the AEC delegate, Joanne Reid, advising us of the \nintention to deregister the DLP. We were given a month to supply “a statement, in writing, \nsetting out the reasons why the party should not be deregistered.” \n\nShortly after this notice I, as registered officer, had a conversation with a member of the AEC \nwho rang me. I asked what we could include in the statement and was advised we could \nprovide any statement that would explain why we should not be deregistered. I twice asked \nwhether we “can we supply a new list of members” and was advised the statement can contain \nanything that demonstrates why we should not be deregistered. The person I spoke with did \nnot refer to a new list or whether a new list could be supplied.  \n\nOn 26 February 2022, we submitted our statement setting out the reasons why we should not \nbe deregistered including the fact that we did have over 1500 members, The email we sent with \nthe statement specifically asked for permission to submit a new list of names and the \nstatement itself also specifically asked for permission to submit a new list of names.  \n\nWe now find that parties who never asked for permission were permitted to lodge new lists \nalong with their statement and those lists were accepted by the AEC. This despite no reference \nto supplying a new list being mentioned in the “intention to deregister” letter we received and \nno acknowledgment or suggestion that a new list could be lodged being mentioned in my \nphone conversation with the AEC, despite my specifically asking that question. \n\nAt the very least the AEC, who are happy to call and advise us that we are being deregistered, \ncould have called and said a new list would be accepted if supplied within 24 hours. I am \nseriously concerned about impartiality in the AEC when some parties were permitted to lodge a \nnew list supposedly without permission while those who sought permission were ignored, to \ntheir detriment.  \n\nInstead of acting on the request contained in the DLP’s statement and email, the statement \nseems to have been given priority for denial, because barely four business days later we \nreceived the notice of ‘Intention to Deregister.’ Meanwhile, the “Derryn Hinch Justice Party” \nwhich was listed for deregistration on 17 December 2021, the Health Australia Party which was \nlisted on 18 January 2022 and the Australian Progressives which was listed on 11 January 2022 \nall remain on the list of registered parties.  \n\nI would suggest the least the AEC could do is to immediately restore the DLP to the list of \nRegistered Parties while examining the new list of members supplied with this appeal.\n\n\n--- Page 3 ---\n\nAttached to this statement is another list of 1650 members. As mentioned we request we be \nafforded the same treatment as other parties and our qualification for registration be \nimmediately re-established then re-assessed based on this list.   \n\nIn the Notice of Decision on Party Registration dated 4 March 2022, the Delegate, Joanne Reid, \nsimply asserts that she “rejects the reasons outlined by (the DLP) in its statement provided on \n26 February 2022” including both the issue of the legal validity of the sampling process used to \nassess the membership number and the fact that the DLP advised that it has more membership \nnames which it was prevented from providing, without explaining how or why this “rejection” is \ndecided upon.  The fact that the DLP requested permission to lodge another list of members in \nthe very statement the Delegate rejects while other parties, whom the same delegate would \npresumably have dealt with for deregistration purposes, were permitted to lodge new lists \napparently without permission seems to be unfair and suggests the Delegates reasons for \nrejection of our statement are inconsistent with her or the AEC’s actions. \n\nMs Reid declares that she “remain(s) satisfied that the (DLP) does not have 1500 members” \ndespite the fact that we have advised that we have more than the maximum 1650 sample we \nwere permitted to provide, so it is not clear how the Delegate would arrive at this prejudicial \nconclusion when it appears to be at odds with all available facts. \n\nThe use of a sample of only 42 members to draw conclusions regarding the membership status \nof 1572 members would appear to be questionable from the standpoints of both procedural \nfairness and legal validity. In the Notice, the Delegate declares that her faith in the validity of \nthis approach derives from the fact that the Electoral Commission “has previously concluded \nthat the methodology was appropriate for membership testing because it was rational, fair and \npractical in all the circumstances,” however her own organization’s endorsement of its own \nprocess is an entirely circular justification and provides no credibility whatsoever. In fact, from a \nstatistical standpoint, a parametric estimate of valid membership numbers using such a tiny \nsample must have a huge standard error and so can only logically be regarded as indicative \nrather than definitive. \n\nMoreover, the Delegate’s statement that she considers that a statistical estimate “provide(s) a \nmore robust method for ascertaining whether a party has satisfied the requirements of the \nElectoral Act than a statement by the party” appears disingenuous.  \n\nWe did not, nor obviously would anyone else, seriously suggest that an assertion of \nmembership numbers had any weight in assessing eligibility for registration. We merely pointed\n\n\n--- Page 4 ---\n\nout that we had additional members which we could have provided if we had been told that we \nwere allowed to do so. \n\nIn fact, the key question that we raised was neither this nor whether the ABS provided \nestimation method was an effective indicative tool, but rather whether statistical extrapolation \nfrom a sample of only 42 members could be a fair and valid method to decide definitively that a \nparty which supplied 1650 member names did not have 1500 members. \n\nThe DLP would contend that the only way to definitively assess whether a party has the \nminimum 1500 members required by the amended Electoral Act is for the AEC to contact each \nand all of the members provided.  \n\nWhile this may be a major task for the AEC, given that rejection of a party’s claim to the \nrequired membership denies it the right to participate in our nation’s democratic processes, we \nsubmit respectfully that the AEC’s convenience should not be the primary consideration. \n\nAs set out in the Administrative Review Council’s Best Practice Guide to Decision Making, an \nimportant legal requirement in any administrative decision making is to conform to the \nprinciples of natural justice, to the extent that “natural justice generally applies whenever a \nstatute gives power to make an administrative decision that might adversely effects the rights, \ninterests or legitimate expectations of an individual or organization.”1  Moreover, as the guide \nmakes clear, “the requirement of natural justice comes from general administrative law, not \nthe particular statue being administered”2 and these obligations for administrative decision \nmakers are reflected in the Australian Public Service Values and Code of Conduct set down in \nthe Australian Public Service Commissioner’s Directions 2016 and the Public Service Act 1999.      \n\nThe wording of the Delegate’s written decision suggests to us that she may have been \nunfamiliar with these obligations. \n\nIn conclusion, the grounds upon which we request review of the Delegate’s decision are \n\n1.  That in not being advised that we were allowed to submit additional names as part of \n\nour statement on 26 February 2022 as other parties did, we were denied natural justice \nin the decision making process; \n\n1 Administrative Review Council Best Practice Guide 2, “Decision Making: Natural Justice”, 2007, p4 \n2 Ibid, p5\n\n\n--- Page 5 ---\n\n2.  That in not responding to our request for permission to lodge a new list of names, as \n\ncontained in both our email and statement of 26 February 2022, the DLP was denied the \nability to demonstrate our eligibility to registration as was granted to numerous other \nparties; \n\n3.  That the means of statistical extrapolation by which the minimum membership is \n\ndetermined is neither “fair” nor “robust” but merely indicative and therefore does not \ncomply with the AEC’s legal obligations to definitively determine eligibility for \nregistration under the Electoral Act; \n\n4.  That because the AEC failed to contact 1530 of the 1650 members we supplied, the AEC \n\ndenied us a just and equitable assessment of our membership; and \n\n5.  That wording of the Delegate’s written response suggests an apprehended bias against \n\nus and raises the possibility that we were not afforded an objective assessment. \n\nAccordingly we request that our registration be immediately re-established while our ongoing \nentitlement to registration is re-assessed by the Commission, including an assessment of the \nnew list of 1650 member names which we attach.  \n\nYours sincerely \n\nStephen Campbell \nFederal Secretary and Registered Officer \nDemocratic Labour Party\n\nProvide only the markdown formatted summary text. Do not include any conversational filler or preamble."
