            "text": "This FOI document reveals alarming data underscoring the \"designated elector\" scheme's expansion and its profound implications for democratic accountability and social equity. Crucially, it highlights a **dramatic and concerning surge** in new declarations, with 211 individuals designated in the current financial year (2024/25) alone, a stark contrast to the handful in previous years. This aggressive expansion, with all declarations made by delegates rather than the Electoral Commissioner, signals a decentralised process that could undermine robust oversight.\n\nThe document further exposes systemic flaws in oversight and due process. Despite the significant increase in declarations, the mechanism for challenging these restrictions is demonstrably inadequate: only 8 applications for internal review were made across two financial years (2022/23 and 2024/25), with a **shockingly low success rate of only 1 out of 8 declarations being set aside**. The complete absence of external appeals to the Administrative Review Tribunal (zero applications) suggests individuals face formidable, potentially insurmountable, barriers to challenging these fundamental rights restrictions.\n\nCombined with the AEC's stated inability to provide total numbers of designated electors (citing \"No document response\"), this lack of transparency further compounds concerns about the scheme's expanding reach without adequate public scrutiny. The fact that zero declarations have ceased to have effect underscores the seemingly permanent nature of this restriction once applied. From a left-leaning perspective, this document provides compelling evidence that the \"designated elector\" scheme is an expanding, opaque, and unaccountable mechanism that significantly erodes electoral participation, disproportionately impacts vulnerable groups by limiting their democratic engagement, and undermines the principles of broad democratic access and civil liberties."

  "prompt": "From a left-leaning perspective, summarize this specific document within the context of the FOI request. Emphasize its implications for social equity, environmental concerns, or democratic accountability. The overall FOI overview is: From a left-leaning perspective, the \"designated elector\" scheme, revealed by FOI documents, raises serious concerns about social justice and civil liberties by restricting electoral participation. The dramatic escalation to 211 new declarations in FY2024/25 year-to-date, from a handful previously, signals an aggressive expansion that undermines progressive values of broad democratic access. The system appears deeply flawed in its oversight, with a remarkably low success rate for internal reviews (only 1 of 8 set aside) and a complete absence of external appeals, suggesting individuals face significant barriers to challenging these restrictions or regaining their fundamental right to full electoral engagement. Combined with a lack of transparency regarding total numbers, this mechanism appears to be expanding without adequate accountability or due process safeguards, potentially disproportionately impacting vulnerable groups and diminishing essential democratic freedoms.\n\nDocument Text:\n\n\n\n--- Page 1 ---\n\nLEX7939  \n\nFOI Request LEX7939 â€“ Designated Electors Data  \n\nI seek access to the following, as at the close of rolls 7 April 2025: \n\n1.
