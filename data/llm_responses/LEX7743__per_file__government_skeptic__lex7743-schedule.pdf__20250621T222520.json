            "text": "This document, confirming \"Client Details\" are \"publicly available\" on the AEC's transparency website with \"no relevant exemptions applicable,\" serves as stark evidence for a government skeptic. It exposes profound bureaucratic inefficiency, where the FOI process is wasted confirming information already deemed public. This highlights either a critical flaw in government information architecture, rendering \"transparent\" data practically undiscoverable and forcing citizens into an unnecessary FOI loop, or a cynical ploy to inflate transparency claims by formally \"releasing\" material that was never genuinely withheld. The very need for this FOI request, despite the information's public status, points to a lack of accountability in ensuring true information accessibility and a systemic failure to make 'transparency' genuinely functional, ultimately wasting resources and obscuring areas of true opacity."
