            "text": "This policy outlines the Australian Electoral Commission's (AEC) procedures for managing, reporting, and investigating ballot boxes opened prematurely or discovered to be compromised before legislated times. It defines a \"prematurely opened ballot box\" based on seal discrepancies, damage, or opening outside prescribed timeframes, specifically for boxes containing \"ordinary ballot papers or declaration vote envelopes.\" The policy details an investigation process focused on examining these ballot papers or envelopes to determine their inclusion or exclusion from scrutiny, emphasizing the integrity of the electoral result. The provided scenarios consistently revolve around the physical integrity of the ballot box and its *ballot contents*.\n\n**Relevance to FOI Request LEX3041:** This document, provided in response to the FOI request concerning \"foreign objects\" (non-ballots) in ballot boxes, illustrates the AEC's overriding priority on maintaining the integrity of *ballot papers* and *declaration vote envelopes*. The policy's scope and procedures are entirely dedicated to safeguarding the validity and proper handling of votes. It contains no provisions, procedures, or forms for the identification, listing, or management of non-ballot 'foreign objects' found within ballot boxes. This reinforces the FOI request's finding that the AEC's operational focus is on the integrity of the voting process itself, which precludes retrieving such non-ballot items due to the risk of compromising the legitimate ballot contents."

Do not include any conversational filler or preamble.To aid you, the overview of the FOI request is: [REQUEST OVERVIEW START] FOI Request LEX3041 sought a list of \"foreign objects\" (non-ballots) found in ballot boxes and the Australian Electoral Commission's (AEC) response procedures. The AEC released the Election Procedures Handbook, Prematurely Opened Ballot Box Policy, and Prematurely Opened Ballot Box SOP. These documents reveal that the AEC's primary response to \"foreign objects\" (like personal items) is non-retrieval, as opening a box to retrieve such items would compromise electoral integrity, and no procedures or forms for listing or describing non-ballot foreign objects exist. While the \"Prematurely Opened\" documents detail handling for ballot boxes opened prematurely due to issues like seal discrepancies or damage, their focus is on managing the integrity and inclusion/exclusion of *ballots* and declaration vote envelopes, not on cataloging non-ballot items, consistently prioritizing the \"integrity of the result.\"\n [REQUEST OVERVIEW END] \n\n--- MAIN DOCUMENT TEXT START ---\n\n\n\n--- Page 1 ---\n\nPOLICY \n\nPrematurely Opened \nBallot Box \n\nSEPTEMBER 2021\n\n\n--- Page 2 ---\n\nTable of contents \n\nPurpose of policy ..................................................................................................................................................... 3 \n\n1. \n\nLegislative background .................................................................................................................................... 3 \n\n2.

Legislative background \n\n1.1  Section 238B of the Electoral Act and s 41AB of the Referendum Act outline the process that the AEC \n\nand its officers are to undertake when a ballot box is opened prematurely. \n\n2.  Prematurely opened ballot box \n\n2.1  A prematurely opened ballot box includes any ballot box: \n\n• \n\ncontaining either ordinary ballot papers or declaration vote envelopes, that has been opened before \nthe relevant legislated time frame1 \n\n•  discovered to have been opened before the legislated time frame 2  \n\n•  where the seal numbers do not match the numbers recorded on the Record of security seals form, \n\nand the discrepancy cannot be explained. \n\n2.2 \n\nIt excludes ballot boxes where a seal was not affixed correctly in the first place and/or the seal has been \naccidentally damaged and requires replacement. These types of instances are to be dealt with as part of \nnormal operations. \n\n2.3  The legislated time frame for opening ballot boxes is as follows: \n\nBallot boxes \n\nPrior to election day \n\nBefore 6 pm \n\nAfter 6 pm \n\nContaining pre-poll ordinary \nballot papers \n\nUnable to be opened for \nany reason \n\nAble to be opened to sort \n(but not count) from 4pm \non election day \n\nAble to be opened for \nscrutiny \n\nContaining other (static or \nmobile) ordinary ballot papers \n\nUnable to be opened for \nany reason \n\nUnable to be opened for \nany reason \n\nAble to be opened for \nscrutiny \n\nContaining ONLY declaration \nvote envelopes in a static \npolling place, PPVC or mobile \nteam \n\nUnable to be opened for \nany reason \n\nUnable to be opened for \nany reason \n\nAble to be opened for \nsorting and forwarding of \nenvelopes \n\nContaining ONLY declaration \nvote envelopes at an \noverseas post \n\nAble to be opened for \nsorting and forwarding of \nenvelopes  \n\nAble to be opened for \nsorting and forwarding of \nenvelopes \n\nAble to be opened for \nsorting and forwarding of \nenvelopes \n\nContaining ONLY declaration \nvote envelopes; held by a \nDRO \n\nAble to be opened for \npreliminary scrutiny, \npreparation for \ndeclaration exchange \nand forwarding of \nenvelopes within OPCs \n\nAble to be opened for \npreliminary scrutiny, \npreparation for \ndeclaration exchange \nand forwarding of \nenvelopes within OPCs \n\nAble to be opened for \npreliminary and further \nscrutinies and declaration \nexchange \n\n3       POLICY PREMATURELY OPENED BALLOT BOX\n\n\n--- Page 4 ---\n\n3.  Investigation process \n\n3.1  The premature opening of a ballot box (including declaration vote ballot boxes) or the discovery of a \n\nprematurely opened ballot box triggers the requirement to undertake: \n\n•  an investigation into and recording of the details of the premature opening of the ballot box \n\n•  an examination of the ballot papers or declaration vote envelopes in the prematurely opened ballot \n\nbox to enable the Australian Electoral Officer (AEO) for the state or territory concerned to determine \nif they are to be included or excluded from scrutiny. \n\n3.2  The identification of prematurely opened ballot boxes and actions to be taken are the same for federal \n\nelections and referendums, or where the two events are held concurrently.  \n\n3.3  The Prematurely Opened Ballot Box SOP details the correct process to undertake an investigation and \nthe subsequent actions. These procedures must be followed where an officer suspects there is a \nprematurely opened ballot box.  \n\n4.  Scenario guide \n\n4.1  Certain scenarios may be breaches of the Ballot Paper Handling Policy, but are not considered a \nprematurely opened ballot box. These should be dealt with as part of normal operations. \n\n4.2  The following scenario guide provides further information on the definition of what constitutes an ‘opened’ \n\nballot box. Specific action to be taken can be found in the Prematurely Opened Ballot Box SOP. \n\nIn the polling place \n\nBallot box situation \n\nIs this a prematurely opened ballot box? \n\n1. \n\n2. \n\n AEC staff person (such as OIC) has opened ballot box \nprematurely (before prescribed time). \n\n Seal records indicate the ballot box has been opened and \nthen sealed again. \n\n3. \n\n Seal on ballot box has broken or appears faulty. \n\nYes \n\nYes \n\nNo \n\n4. \n\n Original seal has not been affixed to the ballot box properly. \n\nNo \n\n5. \n\n When moving a cardboard ballot box, it splits or comes \nopen, or seal comes off or pulls through cardboard.
