It constitutes a follow-up notice under s 134(6)(c) of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918, reiterating and seeking reconsideration of an objection to the proposed logo of the Australian Federation Party. The sender, on behalf of five objectors, expresses concern that the party's logo, which includes a \"tick\" symbol, could confuse voters on a ballot paper. The primary concern is that voters might interpret the tick as the designated place to mark their vote, potentially leading to invalidated ballots or incorrect numbering, thus undermining the integrity of the voting process.\n\n### Relevance to FOI Request (LEX3070)\n\nThis document is directly relevant to the FOI request (LEX3070) as it falls under the scope of challenges to the AEC's administrative processes concerning party registration. The FOI request specifically notes \"an objection to the Australian Federation Party's logo for potential voter confusion,\" which this document precisely addresses. It provides evidence of an application made during early 2022, raising concerns about a party's registration details (its logo) and its potential impact on voters, aligning with the FOI's theme of challenges and reviews relating to party registration decisions."

Do not include any conversational filler or preamble.To aid you, the overview of the FOI request is: [REQUEST OVERVIEW START] The FOI request (LEX3070) sought applications made to the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) under s 141(2) of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 during early 2022, concerning reviews of party registration and deregistration decisions. The released documents, primarily communications and a detailed statistical analysis, reveal a strong theme of challenges to the AEC's administrative processes. Key content includes multiple parties (e.g., Democratic Labour Party, Flux, Health Australia Party) arguing that the AEC's party membership verification methodology is statistically flawed, unfair, and results in arbitrary deregistration outcomes, with Flux providing extensive analysis asserting the method is \"rigged.\" Additional challenges include the Australian Progressives alleging a clerical error in their deregistration, an objection to the registration of the David Pocock party based on candidate eligibility and name consistency, and an objection to the Australian Federation Party's logo for potential voter confusion.\n [REQUEST OVERVIEW END] \n\n--- MAIN DOCUMENT TEXT START ---\n\n\n\n--- Page 1 ---\n\nFrom:\nSent:\nTo:\nSubject:\n\nFriday, 11 March 2022 7:17 PM\nCommission Secretariat\nNotice under s 134(6)(c) of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 (Electoral Act) - \nAustralian Federation Party\n\nCAUTION:This email originated from outside of the Australian Federal Government. Do not click links or open \nattachments unless you recognise the sender and know the content is safe. \n\nI refer to your reply to my submission on the Australian Federation Party logo.  Although only five have objected to \nthe logo, we all appear to agree. \n\nLogos are placed next to the name or party on the  voting slip.   Voters could easily interpret the tick as the place to \nmark the box.  If a tick is actually put in the box this would invalidate the vote   Alternatively, the correct number \ncould be placed in the box because the voter thought the tick indicated this was what should be done. \n\nI hope that this will be reconsidered.  \n\nMob: \nTel: \n\n1\n\nLEX3070 Released Document No. 13991111Released under the Freedom of Information Act 19821\n\n\n--- Page 2 ---\n\n1. \n\n2. \n\n3. \n\n4. \n\n5. \n\n6. \n\n7. \n\n8. \n\n9. \n\n10. \n\n11. \n\n12. \n\n13. \n\n14. \n\n15. \n\n16. \n\n17. \n\n18. \n\n19. \n\n20. \n\n21. \n\n22. \n\n23. \n\n24. \n\n25. \n\n26. \n\n27. \n\n28. \n\n29. \n\nREDACTION CODES \n\nPersonal Information (name) redacted. \n\nPersonal Information (date of birth) redacted. \n\nPersonal Information (place of birth) redacted \n\nPersonal Information (citizenship) redacted. \n\nPersonal Information (racial or ethnic origin) redacted. \n\nPersonal Information (photograph) redacted \n\nPersonal Information (facsimile of signature) redacted. \n\nPersonal Information (facsimile of manuscript initialling) redacted. \n\nPersonal Information (Individual’s address) redacted. \n\nPersonal Information (Individual’s email address) redacted. \n\nPersonal Information (individual’s telephone number or mobile number) \nredacted. \n\nPersonal Information (individual’s political opinion) redacted. \n\nPersonal Information (opinion about individual) redacted. \n\nPersonal Information (Individuals current or former occupation). \n\nPersonal Information (employment history) redacted. \n\nPersonal Information (qualifications) redacted. \n\nPersonal Information (membership of a professional or trade association). \n\nPersonal Information (membership of a trade union). \n\nPersonal Information (health) redacted. \n\nPersonal Information (membership of a political association) redacted \n\nPersonal Information (religious beliefs or affiliations) redacted. \n\nPersonal Information (sexual orientation or practices). \n\nPersonal Information (criminal record). \n\nPersonal Information (identifying individual) redacted. \n\nPersonal Information (bank account details) redacted) \n\nBusiness information (bank account details) redacted. \n\nBusiness information (billing account details) redacted. \n\nBusiness information (ureasonably affect a person adversely in respect of his \nor her lawful business or professional affairs) redacted. \n\nBusiness Information (reasonably be expected to prejudice the future supply \nof information to the Commonwealth or an agency for the purpose of the \nadministration of a law of the Commonwealth or of a Territory or the \nadministration of matters administered by an agency). \n\n30. \n\nBusiness information (trade secret).\n\n\n--- Page 3 ---\n\n31. \n\n32. \n\n33. \n\n34. \n\n35. \n\n36. \n\n37. \n\n38. \n\nBusiness information (information having a commercial value that would be, \nor could reasonably be expected to be, destroyed or diminished if the \ninformation were disclosed). \n\nLegal Professional Communication redacted. \n\nDeliberative material redacted. \n\nElectoral Roll material redacted. \n\nTests, examinations or audits material redacted. \n\nManagement or assessment of personnel material redacted. \n\nProper and efficient conduct of the operations of AEC material redacted. \n\nLawful methods or procedures for preventing, detecting, investigating, or \ndealing with matters arising out of, breaches or evasions of the law redactged \n\n39. \n\nIrrelevant material redacted.\n\n"
