            "text": "This document, LEX7939, confirms a disturbing pattern of bureaucratic opacity and a lack of accountability within the AEC's \"designated elector\" scheme, directly supporting the broader FOI overview.\n\n1.  **Data Evasion and Opacity:** The AEC's outright refusal to provide the requested current number of designated electors, broken down by state or electoral division (Items 1, 1a, 1b), citing a \"no document response as per decision letter,\" is a stark example of \"data evasion.\" Instead of direct data, it points to a general website for historical numbers, deliberately obscuring the current scale and distribution of these designations. This suggests a calculated effort to prevent public scrutiny of a potentially sensitive classification.\n\n2.  **Unchecked Delegate Power and Overreach:** The document reveals an alarming increase in declarations from 1 in FY 2023/24 to 211 in FY 2024/25 (Item 2), representing the \"211-fold increase\" identified in the overview. Crucially, every single one of these declarations was made by a \"delegate of the Electoral Commissioner\" (Item 2a), not the Commissioner themselves. This confirms a significant and rapid \"decentralization of power,\" raising concerns about \"overreach\" as non-principal officers unilaterally expand a classification with potentially significant implications for voter rights.\n\n3.  **Internal Review as a Rubber Stamp:** The internal review process (Items 3 & 4) appears to be a mere formality. Out of 8 applications for internal review across three financial years, 7 were \"confirmed\" and only 1 was \"set aside.\" This near-perfect confirmation rate strongly indicates that the internal review acts as a \"rubber stamp,\" lacking any meaningful independent assessment. The complete absence of applications for review to the Administrative Review Tribunal (Item 4) further solidifies the point about a \"complete lack of external scrutiny,\" suggesting either a barrier to appeal or a suppressed awareness of avenues for challenge.\n\n4.  **Permanent, Unchallenged Classification:** Most concerningly, zero declarations have ceased to have effect due to natural expiry (Item 5). This directly supports the claim that the scheme effectively creates a \"permanent, unchallenged government classification.\" Without any built-in mechanism for expiry or external review, these designations become enduring, potentially arbitrary classifications that erode due process and lay the groundwork for \"potential abuse of power\" by an unaccountable bureaucracy.\n\nIn essence, this document provides concrete evidence of an agency expanding its power through delegates, refusing to provide transparent data on its scope, and maintaining an internal appeals process that serves to confirm, rather than scrutinize, its own decisions, thereby creating a permanent, unaudited classification."

  "prompt": "From a government skeptic's viewpoint, summarize this specific document within the context of the FOI request. Look for evidence of bureaucracy, lack of accountability, or any hidden agendas. The overall FOI overview is: The FOI documents expose a disturbing lack of accountability within the AEC's \"designated elector\" scheme, revealing a deliberate opacity regarding its scale and distribution through data evasion. The alarming 211-fold increase in designations, exclusively by delegates rather than the Commissioner, signals a concerning decentralization of power prone to overreach. Furthermore, the internal review process acts as a rubber stamp, completely lacking external scrutiny or natural expiry for designations, effectively creating a permanent, unchallenged government classification that erodes due process and invites potential abuse of power.\n\nDocument Text:\n\n\n\n--- Page 1 ---\n\nLEX7939  \n\nFOI Request LEX7939 â€“ Designated Electors Data  \n\nI seek access to the following, as at the close of rolls 7 April 2025: \n\n1.
