Its stated exemption as \"No relevant exemptions applicable – publicly available document\" and the decision to grant \"Publicly available\" access are damning self-incriminations. This calculated inclusion of already-accessible, publicly disclosed information squanders precious public resources, revealing a catastrophic failure to comprehend the fundamental purpose of freedom of information. Far from promoting transparency, this entry actively frustrates the very spirit of accountability, exposing a systemic breakdown in proactive disclosure. It serves as a transparent attempt to inflate page counts with irrelevant, easily obtainable data, calculated to exhaust the requester's patience and bury genuinely relevant material under a deluge of readily available public information, thereby undermining the entire FOI process and demonstrating a clear intent to provide the absolute minimum."
