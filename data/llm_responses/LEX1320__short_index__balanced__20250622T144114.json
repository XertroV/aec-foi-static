They describe the **eligibility criteria** (e.g., 18+, Australian citizen, enrolled), **disqualifications** (referencing Section 44 of the Constitution for issues like foreign allegiance or 'office of profit'), and the **nomination process**.\n    *   These guides detail the use of various nomination forms, including **Form 60** for individual candidate details, and **Forms 60a, 60b, 60c** for different nomination types (bulk, single endorsed, unendorsed/incumbent independent).\n    *   Information on **nomination deposits** ($1,000 for House of Representatives) is provided, specifying payment methods (cash, bank cheque) and the conditions for **deposit refunds** (elected or securing at least four percent of formal first preference votes).\n    *   The documents also cover details about ballot paper appearance (e.g., party name/abbreviation/logo or \"Independent\"), the public nature of nomination forms (with some contact details optionally withheld), and the process for appointing candidate agents.\n\n*   **Mr. Timothy Robert Wilson's Nomination and Deposit:**\n    *   The \"SCHEDULE OF RETRIEVED DOCUMENTS\" directly addresses Mr. Wilson's nomination:\n        *   It indicates that Mr. Wilson was nominated as part of a **bulk nomination** by the Liberal Party of Australia (Victorian Division) using form **AECEF060-a**, dated 6 June 2016. This form was signed by the Deputy Electoral Commissioner for the Liberal Party.\n        *   A **receipt of payment** for House of Representatives Nominations (FE2016) confirms that the Liberal Party of Australia (Victoria) paid the required deposit on 6 June 2016.\n        *   The schedule also lists a specific individual nomination form for Mr. Timothy Wilson (AECEF060), although the listed date (27 May 2017) is an anomaly for a 2016 election document.\n    *   While the initial payment receipt is provided, the retrieved documents **do not include specific receipts or documents explicitly detailing the refund** of Mr. Wilson's deposit. The general conditions for deposit refunds are outlined in the \"Candidates Handbook\".\n\nProvide only the markdown formatted summary text. Do not include any conversational filler or preamble."
