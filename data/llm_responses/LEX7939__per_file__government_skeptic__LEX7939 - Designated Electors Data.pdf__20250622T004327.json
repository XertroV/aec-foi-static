            "text": "This document, in the context of the FOI request, immediately signals systemic opacity and a lack of accountability within the AEC's \"designated elector\" scheme.\n\nFirstly, the explicit \"No document response as per decision letter\" for granular data on designated electors by state/territory and electoral division (Request 1) is a clear act of **data evasion**. Instead of providing the requested specific data, the AEC redirects to a public website with aggregated, less informative data, effectively obscuring the true geographic and local impact of these designations.\n\nSecondly, the revealed 211-fold increase in declarations in 2024/25 (Request 2) is alarming, particularly when coupled with the explicit admission that **every single one of these declarations was made by a delegate, not the Electoral Commissioner (Request 2a)**. This confirms a disturbing decentralization of power, where lower-level officials are rapidly expanding a significant classification without direct oversight from the highest authority, inviting potential overreach and a lack of central accountability.\n\nThirdly, the internal review process is demonstrably a **rubber stamp**. Out of 249 declarations made across the specified financial years, only 8 applications for internal review were submitted (Request 3). Crucially, only **one** of these 8 reviews ever resulted in a declaration being \"set aside\"; all others were \"confirmed\" (Request 4). This near-perfect confirmation rate, combined with zero applications for external review to the Administrative Review Tribunal (Request 4), shows a complete lack of meaningful internal or external scrutiny, effectively rendering the review process an illusion of accountability.\n\nFinally, the most concerning revelation is that **zero declarations have ceased to have effect due to natural expiry (Request 5)**. This directly confirms the creation of a **permanent, unchallenged government classification** with no natural expiry mechanism. Once designated, individuals appear to remain classified indefinitely, eroding due process and establishing a potentially lifelong, unreviewable status by a government agency, ripe for abuse of power. The document, therefore, presents clear evidence of bureaucratic opacity, a delegated power prone to unchecked expansion, and a system devoid of genuine accountability or due process safeguards."

  "prompt": "From a government skeptic's viewpoint, summarize this specific document within the context of the FOI request. Look for evidence of bureaucracy, lack of accountability, or any hidden agendas. The overall FOI overview is: The FOI documents expose a disturbing lack of accountability within the AEC's \"designated elector\" scheme, revealing a deliberate opacity regarding its scale and distribution through data evasion. The alarming 211-fold increase in designations, exclusively by delegates rather than the Commissioner, signals a concerning decentralization of power prone to overreach. Furthermore, the internal review process acts as a rubber stamp, completely lacking external scrutiny or natural expiry for designations, effectively creating a permanent, unchallenged government classification that erodes due process and invites potential abuse of power.\n\nDocument Text:\n\n\n\n--- Page 1 ---\n\nLEX7939  \n\nFOI Request LEX7939 â€“ Designated Electors Data  \n\nI seek access to the following, as at the close of rolls 7 April 2025: \n\n1.
