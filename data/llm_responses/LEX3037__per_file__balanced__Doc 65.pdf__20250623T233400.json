            "text": "This document is a Meta Newsroom Post from March 15, 2022, authored by Josh Machin, Head of Public Policy for Meta Australia, detailing Meta's comprehensive strategy to prepare for the 2022 Australian Federal Election. The strategy focuses on four key areas:\n\n*   **Combating Abuse, Misinformation, and Election Interference:** Meta announced the expansion of its third-party fact-checking program in Australia to include RMIT FactLab, alongside Agence France Presse and Australian Associated Press. It committed to providing grants to fact-checkers, reducing the distribution of false content, and running media literacy campaigns like \"Check the Facts\" (with AAP, translated into multiple languages) and \"Don't be a Misinfluencer\" (with First Draft).\n*   **Security and Election Interference:** Meta highlighted its global teams dedicated to identifying and combating coordinated inauthentic behavior and protecting high-risk accounts through programs like Facebook Protect. Crucially, the document states Meta is \"coordinating with the Government's election integrity assurance taskforce and security agencies\" and \"working with the Australian Electoral Commission and political parties to run training sessions for all candidates.\"\n*   **Encouraging Transparency Around Political, Election, and Social Issues Ads:** Meta detailed mandatory authorization processes for advertisers running political ads, requiring \"Paid for by\" disclaimers, and archiving all such ads in a public Ad Library for seven years. It also noted a feature allowing users to see fewer political ads.\n*   **Encouraging Civic Engagement and Empowering Voters:** Meta planned to use on-platform notifications to remind users to vote and provide reliable information about the voting process.\n\n**Relevance to FOI Request LEX3037:**\n\nThis document is highly relevant to FOI request LEX3037, as it directly corroborates and provides specific detail on the proactive engagement between the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) and major tech companies, including Meta, regarding the 2022 federal election. While not a direct piece of correspondence, it is a public statement by Meta explicitly confirming its \"coordinating with the Government's election integrity assurance taskforce\" and its direct work \"with the Australian Electoral Commission\" to provide training and safeguard election integrity. This demonstrates Meta's commitment to, and the nature of its collaboration with, the AEC and its Electoral Integrity Assurance Taskforce to identify, monitor, and address electoral misinformation, disinformation, and non-compliant content as described in the FOI request overview."

Do not include any conversational filler or preamble.To aid you, the overview of the FOI request is: [REQUEST OVERVIEW START] An FOI request (LEX3037) revealed correspondence from early 2022 between the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) and major tech companies, including Meta, Twitter, Google, Microsoft, and TikTok, regarding compliance with electoral law and the 2022 federal election. The released documents, featuring an \"Electoral Communications Escalation Scenarios\" guide and extensive communication, detail the AEC's proactive engagement—primarily through its Electoral Integrity Assurance Taskforce—with these platforms. This collaboration focused on identifying, monitoring, and addressing electoral misinformation, disinformation, and non-compliant content through direct communication channels and content referrals, thereby safeguarding election integrity.\n [REQUEST OVERVIEW END] \n\n--- MAIN DOCUMENT TEXT START ---\n\n\n\n--- Page 1 ---\n\nNEWSROOM POST – STRICTLY EMBARGOED UNTIL 12.01AM AEDT 15 MARCH 2022\n\nHow Meta is Preparing for the 2022 Australian Election\nBy Josh Machin, Head of Public Policy for Meta Australia\n\n● Meta has been preparing for this year’s Australian election for a long time and will be using a\ncomprehensive strategy to combat misinformation, election interference, and other forms of\nabuse on our platforms.\n\n● We’re expanding our third-party fact-checking program in Australia to include RMIT FactLab.\nThey’ll join Agence France Presse and Australian Associated Press to review and rate content.\nWe’ll also be providing one-off grants to all our fact-checkers to increase their capacity in the\nlead up to the election.\n\n● We’re also working with the Australian Associated Press to re-run the “Check the Facts” media\nliteracy campaign in three other languages - into Vietnamese, Simplified Chinese and Arabic to\nextend the benefits of the campaign even further.\n\nWith the Australian Election set to take place in the coming months, Meta has been preparing for them\nfor a long time. We’ve been involved in more than 200 elections around the world since 2017, and we’ve\nlearned key lessons from each one about where to focus our teams, technologies, and investments so\nthey will have the greatest impact. Here are some of the ways that we’re already promoting safety and\nintegrity across our platforms ahead of this year’s Australian Election.\n\nCombating Abuse, Misinformation, and Election Interference Using a Comprehensive Approach\n\nWe’ve made significant investments in safety and security, including approximately $5 billion/ $AU7\nbillion in 2021 alone and now have more than 40,000 people around the world working on safety and\nsecurity. These investments have allowed us to build our ability to reduce the likelihood of abuses -\nincluding election interference, misinformation and online harms - from happening in the first place,\nrather than just addressing them when they occur. For this year’s Australian election, this work will\ninclude:\n\n● Announcing a new Australian Fact-Checker. We know the importance of ensuring Australians\nhave access to reliable information about the election in Australia. Therefore, we are pleased to\nannounce the expansion of our third party fact checking program in Australia today. From March\n21, RMIT FactLab will join Meta’s global independent fact checking program in reviewing and\nrating the accuracy of content in the lead up to the 2022 Australian Election, alongside Agence\nFrance Presse and the Australian Associated Press. We'll also be providing one-off grants to all\nour fact-checkers to increase their capacity in the lead up to the election. Our fact checkers work\nto reduce the spread of misinformation across Meta’s services. When they rate something as\n\nReleased under the FOI ActReleased under the FOI Act\n\n\n--- Page 2 ---\n\nfalse, we significantly reduce its distribution so fewer people see it. We also notify people who\ntry to share something rated as false and add a warning label with a link to a debunking article.\n● Russell Skelton, Director of RMIT FactLab said, “We see this as a really important public service.\nIf we can play a role in preventing the dissemination of misinformation on social media that has\nthe potential to mislead or harm, then we see that as providing a really critical service.”\n\n● We are also working with expert organisations such as First Draft to increase monitoring for\nmisinformation in the lead-up to the election and publish related analyses and reporting on their\nwebsite. First Draft will also be providing pre-election training for Australian journalists on how\nto identify and prevent amplifying mis and dis information.\n\n● Empowering People to Identify False News. Since we know it’s not enough to just limit or\n\nremove harmful or misleading electoral misinformation that people see, we’re giving people\nmore context about a post so they can make an informed decision on what to read, trust and\nshare. We have invested in dedicated Australian initiatives including:\n\n○ Working with the Australian Associated Press to launch an education and awareness\ncampaign comprising a series of short videos modelling how people can recognise and\navoid misinformation by taking simple steps to 'Check the Facts'. The campaign will run\nagain this April and will include, for the first time, content translated in three other\nlanguages - Vietnamese, Simplified Chinese and Arabic to extend the benefits of the\ncampaign even further.\n\n○ Partnering with First Draft to develop the “Don’t be a Misinfluencer” campaign on\n\nFacebook and Instagram to help creators and influencers to share tips for spotting false\nnews.\n\nSecurity and election interference\n\n● Combatting Influence Operations. We have specialised global teams to identify and take action\nagainst threats to the election, including signs of coordinated inauthentic behaviour across our\napps. We are also coordinating with the Government's election integrity assurance taskforce and\nsecurity agencies in the lead up to the election. We’ve also improved our AI so that we can more\neffectively detect and block fake accounts, which are often behind this activity.\n\n○ Since 2017, we have removed over 150 networks around the world including ahead of\nmajor democratic elections. We’re working to find and remove any networks of\nCoordinated Inauthentic Behaviour. We’ll also share publicly what we find.\n● Protecting candidates and leaders running in the Australian election. In December 2021, we\nextended our Facebook Protect security program to Australia. The program has been rolled out\nto those who might be at a higher risk of being targeted online, such as candidates and public\nofficials, encouraging them to adopt stronger account security protections. We will also be\nrunning a Facebook security prompt to candidates and leaders to remind them to turn on two\nfactor authentication. We are working with the Australian Electoral Commission and political\nparties to run training sessions for all candidates on our policies and tools and how to keep safe\nin the lead up to the election.\n\nReleased under the FOI ActReleased under the FOI Act\n\n\n--- Page 3 ---\n\nEncouraging transparency around political, election and social issues ads\n\n● Mandatory transparency for political ads. Since the 2019 Australian Federal Election, we’ve\nmade a series of changes for advertisers in Australia that want to run electoral, political and\nsocial issue ads. Advertisers are now required to go through an authorisation process using\ngovernment-issued photo ID, and place a “Paid for by” disclaimers on their ads. This includes any\nperson creating, modifying, publishing or pausing ads that reference political figures, political\nparties or elections. It also includes social issue ads that seek to influence public opinion through\ndiscussion, debate or advocacy for or against important topics, such as civil and social rights,\ncrime, environmental politics, education or immigration. We launched these requirements for\nsocial issue ads last year, before the first possible election date, to ensure it was in place for the\nAustralian federal election. Any political, electoral or social issue ads on Facebook and Instagram\nthat do not have the correct authorisation or disclaimers will be removed from the platform and\narchived in a public Ad Library for seven years.\n\n● Allowing Australians to control their experience. While political and social issue ads play an\nimportant role in every election, people have told us they want the option to see fewer of them\nin their Facebook and Instagram feeds. Last year, we announced a new feature that gives people\nmore control by giving them the  choice to see fewer social issues, electoral, and political ads.\n\nEncouraging civic engagement and empowering voters\n\nWe want to do more than just prevent abuse on our platforms during elections. We also want to\nempower people to participate, so for this year’s Australian elections, we’re supporting civic engagement\nin a number of ways.\n\n● Developing products on the platform to encourage people to vote. Closer to election day we\nwill begin running notifications at the top of Facebook’s Feed for people over 18, reminding\nthem to vote, while also connecting them with reliable information about the voting process. We\nwill also be launching Instagram Stories elections stickers to celebrate and encourage voter\nengagement.\n\nReleased under the FOI ActReleased under the FOI Act\n\n\n--- Page 4 ---\n\nElection Day Reminder (example only)\n\n● Informing people about the latest election communications from political parties, journalists\nand the Australian Election Commission. We will release a public, Live Display on Crowdtangle\ndedicated to the Australian Election. The Live Display will provide real-time coverage of the most\nrecent communications about the election on Facebook and Instagram.\n\nAs we get closer to the Australian election, we’ll stay vigilant to emerging threats and take additional\nsteps if necessary to prevent abuse on our platform while also empowering people in Australia to use\ntheir voice by voting.\n\n++++\n\nAbout RMIT\n\nReleased under the FOI ActReleased under the FOI Act\n\n\n--- Page 5 ---\n\nRMIT FactLab is a research hub at RMIT University dedicated to debunking misinformation online and\ndeveloping critical awareness about its origins and spread.
