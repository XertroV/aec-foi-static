            "text": "The document, LEX7939, provides concerning data that reinforces the left-leaning critique of the \"designated elector\" scheme as a threat to democratic accountability and social equity. Most strikingly, it reveals a dramatic, aggressive expansion of the scheme, with 211 new declarations in the 2024/25 financial year to date, a monumental increase from just 37 in 2022/23 and a mere 1 in 2023/24. This rapid escalation, combined with the fact that all recent declarations were made by delegates rather than the Electoral Commissioner, highlights a worrying decentralisation of a power that restricts fundamental voting rights without apparent commensurate senior oversight.\n\nThe document further exposes severe limitations in due process and avenues for redress. Out of eight internal review applications made across 2022/23 and 2024/25, only one declaration was set aside, with the remaining seven being confirmed. This remarkably low success rate (only 12.5% of challenges succeeding) underscores significant barriers individuals face in disputing these restrictions, effectively denying meaningful access to a fair review. Compounding this, there have been zero applications for external review to the Administrative Review Tribunal, suggesting a complete lack of accessible or effective external appeal mechanisms for those whose electoral participation is curtailed.\n\nCrucially, the AEC's refusal to provide the requested total number of designated electors, or breakdowns by state/territory and electoral division, signifies a profound lack of transparency. This opacity obstructs public and parliamentary scrutiny, making it impossible to assess the full scale or potential disproportionate impact on specific demographics or vulnerable communities, thereby undermining democratic accountability. The document confirms that no declarations have naturally ceased effect, implying a permanent or semi-permanent disenfranchisement for those designated. Collectively, these revelations paint a picture of an expanding, opaque system with inadequate safeguards, posing a direct threat to broad democratic access and civil liberties in Australia."

  "prompt": "From a left-leaning perspective, summarize this specific document within the context of the FOI request. Emphasize its implications for social equity, environmental concerns, or democratic accountability. The overall FOI overview is: From a left-leaning perspective, the \"designated elector\" scheme, revealed by FOI documents, raises serious concerns about social justice and civil liberties by restricting electoral participation. The dramatic escalation to 211 new declarations in FY2024/25 year-to-date, from a handful previously, signals an aggressive expansion that undermines progressive values of broad democratic access. The system appears deeply flawed in its oversight, with a remarkably low success rate for internal reviews (only 1 of 8 set aside) and a complete absence of external appeals, suggesting individuals face significant barriers to challenging these restrictions or regaining their fundamental right to full electoral engagement. Combined with a lack of transparency regarding total numbers, this mechanism appears to be expanding without adequate accountability or due process safeguards, potentially disproportionately impacting vulnerable groups and diminishing essential democratic freedoms.\n\nDocument Text:\n\n\n\n--- Page 1 ---\n\nLEX7939  \n\nFOI Request LEX7939 â€“ Designated Electors Data  \n\nI seek access to the following, as at the close of rolls 7 April 2025: \n\n1.
