            "text": "From a government skeptic's viewpoint, this document, Document No. 4 from FOI request LS7888, provides internal validation of the AEC's data integrity problems and bureaucratic inefficiencies within its Indigenous Electoral Participation Program. The initial email from Guy Lewis explicitly details a core dataset of \"107,607 Indigenous people that are only on the Centrelink file,\" which forms the basis of the AEC's \"new methodology.\" Crucially, Lewis simultaneously admits this data requires an immediate \"rerunning... against the deceased persons file and deleted records\" by \"Mike,\" and Warrick Poyser highlights the need for \"additional/special\" work with BDM data to establish eligibility *before* any \"meaningful direct enrolment effort.\" This directly supports the FOI request's assertion of \"questionable data manipulation\" and \"internal data integrity issues,\" demonstrating the AEC was leveraging a raw, unverified, and likely inflated number as its starting point.\n\nThe subsequent email from Angelo Rojas, dated months later, reveals an ongoing internal struggle with basic data correlation and hypothesis testing (e.g., about Email/SMS effectiveness), still awaiting a crucial \"extract\" from \"Mike.\" This highlights a slow, internally-focused bureaucratic process that prioritizes theoretical data analysis and prediction over demonstrable, efficient outreach. The cryptic and incomplete table in Rojas's email further exemplifies poor internal data presentation or a lack of clear, actionable metrics. Combined with the numerous redaction codes, particularly for \"deliberative material\" and \"proper and efficient conduct of the operations of AEC material,\" the document suggests a concerted effort to manage perceptions and obscure the true operational challenges, inefficiencies, and lack of readiness underlying the program."

  "prompt": "From a government skeptic's viewpoint, summarize this specific document within the context of the FOI request. Look for evidence of bureaucracy, lack of accountability, or any hidden agendas. The overall FOI overview is: The Australian Electoral Commission's (AEC) response to FOI request LS7888 exposes a troubling lack of transparency, questionable data manipulation, and apparent inefficiency within its Indigenous Electoral Participation Program (IEPP). From a skeptic's viewpoint, the AEC deliberately withheld crucial planning, cost, and staffing details, raising immediate suspicions about public accountability and genuine community involvement. Its \"new methodology\" conveniently presented a dramatically improved Indigenous enrolment rate by leveraging Centrelink data, despite internal caveats about \"courageous assumptions\" and figures being \"indicative only,\" and a Deputy Commissioner's explicit warning against deliberate misrepresentation. This statistically dubious approach, coupled with demonstrably inefficient outreach—resulting in a meager 3.6% enrolment conversion from a major event—and documented internal data integrity issues, suggests a bureaucratic exercise primarily focused on managing perception and obscuring true costs rather than achieving substantive outcomes for Indigenous enrolment.\n\nDocument Text:\n\nFrom: Angelo Rojas <Angelo.Rojas@aec.gov.au>  \nSent: Monday, 4 June 2018 3:45 PM \nTo: Guy Lewis <Guy.Lewis@aec.gov.au> \nCc: Stephanie Maxwell <Stephanie.Maxwell@aec.gov.au> \nSubject: FW: Indigenous data [SEC=UNCLASSIFIED] \n\nGuy - as discussed, the number of new enrolments for Indigenous not on the roll could be predicted to a fair extent by the proportion of Email/SMSs \nprovided by State. Further analysis of this shows that the strong correlation is for people aged 18-39. \n\nThe proportion of people aged 18-39 in NT, WA and SA who provided Email/SMS is low and so is their proportion of new enrolments. This analysis will be \nmore direct when Mike provides me with the extract that includes Email and/or SMS sent to confirm two hypothesis: \n\n1. We are sending less Email/SMS to these states.\n2. Additionally, enrolment response rates are also lower for these states than for the rest (higher level of disengagement).\n\nLS7888 Released Document No. 4Released under the Freedom of Information Act 1982\fReleased under the Freedom of Information Act 1982\fReleased under the Freedom of Information Act 1982\f60-69 \n70+ \n\n1.4% \n0.0% \n100.0% \n\n1.2% \n0.2% \n100.0% \n\n1.8% \n0.4% \n100.0% \n\n1.0% \n0.2% \n100.0% \n\n3.6% \n0.2% \n100.0% \n\n0.8% \n0.0% \n100.0% \n\n1.0% \n0.0% \n100.0% \n\n1.9% \n0.4% \n100.0% \n\n1.4% \n0.2% \n100.0% \n\nTotal % \n\nAngelo Rojas | Senior Project Officer  \nRoll Program & Community Engagement Section | Roll Management & Community Engagement Branch \n\nLS7888 Released Document No. 4Released under the Freedom of Information Act 1982 \n \n \n\fAustralian Electoral Commission \nT: (02) 6271 4507 X: 21336 M: \n\nFrom: Warrick Poyser  \nSent: Thursday, 8 March 2018 5:12 PM \nTo: Guy Lewis <Guy.Lewis@aec.gov.au> \nCc: Delyse Paliaga <Delyse.Paliaga@aec.gov.au>; Gina Dario <Gina.Dario@aec.gov.au>; Stephanie Maxwell \n<Stephanie.Maxwell@aec.gov.au>; Angelo Rojas <Angelo.Rojas@aec.gov.au>; Michael Roden <Michael.Roden@aec.gov.au> \nSubject: RE: Indigenous data [SEC=UNCLASSIFIED] \n\nThanks Guy – this data is very interesting. \nI suspect we may have to do something additional/special with the BDM data to establish eligibility prior to being able to do any meaningful \ndirect enrolment effort. \n\nWarrick Poyser  \nSystems Delivery & Modernisation Section | Operations Branch \nAustralian Electoral Commission \nT: (02) 6271 4452 X: 21319 M: \n\nFrom: Guy Lewis  \nSent: Thursday, 8 March 2018 3:38 PM \nTo: Warrick Poyser <Warrick.Poyser@aec.gov.au> \nCc: Delyse Paliaga <Delyse.Paliaga@aec.gov.au>; Gina Dario <Gina.Dario@aec.gov.au>; Stephanie Maxwell \n\nLS7888 Released Document No. 4777Released under the Freedom of Information Act 1982  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n\f<Stephanie.Maxwell@aec.gov.au>; Angelo Rojas <Angelo.Rojas@aec.gov.au>; Michael Roden <Michael.Roden@aec.gov.au> \nSubject: Indigenous data [SEC=UNCLASSIFIED] \n\nWarrick, the age breakdown of the 107,607 Indigenous people that are only on the Centrelink file is. \n\nYear of Birth \n1900 – 1920 \n1924 – 1930 \n1931 – 1940 \n1941 – 1950 \n1951 – 1960 \n1961 – 1970 \n1971 – 1980 \n1981 – 1990 \n1991 – 2000 \n2001 \n\nNumber \n23  \n239  \n944  \n2,667  \n6,201  \n12,345  \n16,216  \n23,863  \n41,597  \n3,512  \n\nTotal   107,607  \n\n% \n0.02% \n0.2% \n0.9% \n2.5% \n5.8% \n11.5% \n15.1% \n22.2% \n38.7% \n3.3% \n100% \n\nYouth Group (18 to 24)  \n\n33,008  \n\n30.7% \n\nMike is also rerunning the data against the deceased persons file and deleted records to remove those who are deceased and identify those who have been \nenrolled in the past.
