            "text": "This document, an Estimates Brief from October 2019, starkly highlights a persistent democratic deficit for Indigenous Australians within the context of the Australian Electoral Commission's (AEC) Indigenous Electoral Participation Program (IEPP). While the AEC commends itself on a record high national enrolment rate of 97.0% for the 2019 federal election, the reported Indigenous enrolment rate stands significantly lower at 76.6%, a figure the document admits \"remained steady\" and labels any gap \"concerning.\"\n\nFrom a left-leaning perspective, the term \"steady\" for a 76.6% enrolment rate, when the national rate is 97.0%, is not a sign of progress but rather a stark indictment of the ongoing inequities in electoral participation. This substantial 20.4 percentage point gap underscores a fundamental failure to achieve genuine social equity in Australia's democratic process.\n\nFurthermore, the document's reliance on an \"estimated Indigenous enrolment rate\" subtly reinforces the critical progressive shortcoming identified in the FOI overview: the continued absence of a direct Indigenous identifier on the federal roll. This systemic lack of accurate, self-identified data impedes genuine democratic accountability, as it prevents a precise understanding of the enrolment landscape and the effectiveness of targeted interventions. Without direct identification, efforts to \"Close the Gap\" remain based on \"indicative only\" data, obscuring the true extent of disengagement or barriers.\n\nWhile the document notes the AEC is \"investing in partnerships and targeted activities that extend its reach into remote communities\" and that \"Remote Area Mobile Polling remains an important component,\" it provides no evidence of Indigenous involvement in the planning or design of these initiatives. This omission, when viewed through the lens of the broader FOI overview, confirms a significant deviation from principles of self-determination and co-design. Such top-down approaches, even if well-intentioned, inherently limit their potential for genuine social equity, as they fail to empower Indigenous communities to shape the solutions that best serve their unique needs. The persistence of the enrolment gap, despite these stated efforts, underscores the urgent need for a deeper commitment to community-led solutions and genuine partnership to address this critical democratic shortfall."

  "prompt": "From a left-leaning perspective, summarize this specific document within the context of the FOI request. Emphasize its implications for social equity, environmental concerns, or democratic accountability. The overall FOI overview is: The Australian Electoral Commission's Indigenous Electoral Participation Program (IEPP) between 2018 and 2019 presents a mixed picture from a left-leaning perspective. While commendably recognizing and actively addressing the significant disparity in Indigenous electoral enrolment through pragmatic efforts like leveraging Centrelink data to boost participation towards \"Closing the Gap\" objectives, critical progressive shortcomings persist. A fundamental systemic failing is the continued absence of a direct Indigenous identifier on the federal roll, necessitating reliance on \"indicative only\" data. Crucially, the documents reveal no Indigenous involvement in the program's planning or design, a significant deviation from principles of self-determination and co-design. Furthermore, the extensive use of sensitive Centrelink data raises substantial civil liberties concerns regarding privacy and the blurring of lines between social support and civic duties, indicating that a deeper commitment to genuine equity and community-led solutions is still needed within this vital initiative.\n\nDocument Text:\n\nESTIMATES BRIEF – HOT ISSUE \n\nSupplementary Budget Estimates, October 2019 \n\nCURRENT ENROLMENT FIGURES, TRENDS \n\nIssue \n\nFor the 2019 federal election, more Australians were enrolled than ever before— \nboth in terms of raw numbers and as a percentage of the eligible population. \n\nKey facts and figures \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n16,424,248 Australians were enrolled to vote in the 2019 federal election,\nrepresenting an enrolment rate of 97.0 per cent.\n\nThe youth enrolment rate (18-24 year olds) at the federal election was\n88.8 per cent. Like the general population, young people are enrolled at\nrecord levels.\n\n.\n\nThe Indigenous enrolment rate remained steady and for 2018-19 the\nnational estimated Indigenous enrolment rate is at 76.6 per cent.\n\nKey points \n\nThe Australian Electoral Commission works to ensure the full electoral\nparticipation of all eligible Australians. The electoral roll for the 2019\nfederal election was the largest and most complete ever.\n\nA record 16,424,248 Australians were determined as enrolled to vote in\nthe 2019 federal election, from of an estimated eligible population of\n16.9 million people. This represents an enrolment rate of 97.0 per cent, an\nincrease on the previous record rate for the 2016 federal election.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSB19-000044 \n\n.\n\n1 \n\nLS7888 Released Document No. 411919191919Released under the Freedom of Information Act 1982\fBackground \n\n2019 federal election \n\n A record 16,424,248 electors were enrolled from of an estimated eligible population of\n\n16.9 million people. This represents a national enrolment rate of 97.0 per cent.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImmediately following the roll close the AEC reported a preliminary enrolment rate of\n96.8 per cent. This, however, was subsequently revised to 97.0 per cent following the\napplication of more up-to-date eligible enrolment population estimates.\n\nThe enrolment rate exceeded the AEC’s target of 95 per cent in all states and territories\nexcept the Northern Territory, where it increased from 81.1 per cent at the 2016 election\nto 83.9 per cent.\n\nThe youth enrolment rate (18-24 year olds) was 88.8 per cent. Like the general\npopulation, young people are enrolled at record levels.\n\nTable: Summary of key enrolment metrics \n\nEnrolment metric \n\nFE2016 \n\nAMLPS \n\nFE2019 \n\nChange between \nFE2016 and FE2019 \n\nEnrolled electors \n\n15,676,659  16,011,891  16,424,248 \n\n 747,589\n\nEnrolment rate \n\nEstimated not \nenrolled \n\n95.0% \n\n95.7% \n\n97.0%   2.0 percentage points\n\n816,437 \n\n724,055 \n\n509,891 \n\n 306,546\n\nYouth enrolment rate \n\n86.7% \n\n88.6% \n\n88.8%   2.1 percentage points\n\nCurrent state of the roll \n\n As at 30 September 2019, the national enrolment rate was 96.8 per cent, which is\n\n0.2 percentage points lower than for the 2019 federal election.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is normal for the enrolment rate to decline following an election. The estimated number\nof people not enrolled has grown by around 37,000 since the election with the vast\nmajority of these being people who turned 18 following the election.\n\nIn the lead up to the 2019 election, the AEC conducted an enrolment stimulation exercise,\ntargeting 410,000 people nationally who were not enrolled.\n\nYouth enrolment \n\n Younger electors tend to enrol in proximity to an electoral event.\n\n\n\nThe youth enrolment rate (18-24 year olds) as at 30 September 2019 was 86.5 per cent\nwith 1,643,338 enrolled youth, a reduction of 2.3 percentage points since the federal\nelection.\n\n While the AEC works to maintain the youth enrolment rate as high as possible, it is not\n\nunusual for the youth enrolment rate to improve at the time of a federal election and then\ndecline between elections.\n\nSB19-000044 \n\n2 \n\nLS7888 Released Document No. 41Released under the Freedom of Information Act 1982\fIndigenous enrolment \n\n\n\nThe AEC commenced publication of Indigenous enrolment rate estimates by state and\nterritory as at 30 June 2018.\n\n A previous national Indigenous enrolment estimate of 58 per cent was calculated in 2014\n\nusing a different methodology.\n\n\n\nThe national Indigenous enrolment rate estimate remains steady and as at 30 June 2019\nthe rate was 76.6 per cent compared with 76.4 per cent in 2018.\n\n Any gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous enrolment rates is concerning.\n\n\n\nThe AEC is working to ensure the full electoral participation of all eligible Australians\nand is investing in partnerships and targeted activities that extend its reach into remote\ncommunities. Remote Area Mobile Polling remains an important component of election\nservice delivery.\n\nNorthern Territory enrolment \n\n\n\n\n\nEnrolment in the Northern Territory has shown consistent improvement.\n\nThe enrolment rate in the Northern Territory increased by 9.8 percentage points between\n30 June 2010 and 30 June 2019 while the national enrolment rate increased by\n7.4 percentage points.\n\nNorthern \nTerritory \n\nEnrolment \n\nEstimated \nEligible \nPopulation \n\nEnrolment \nrate \n\nEstimated not \nenrolled \n\n30/06/2010 \n30/06/2011 \n30/06/2012 \n30/06/2013 \n30/06/2014 \n30/06/2015 \n30/06/2016 \n30/06/2017 \n30/06/2018 \n30/06/2019 \n\n118,401 \n121,919 \n122,715 \n126,934 \n130,857 \n129,133 \n133,553 \n137,773 \n138,581 \n140,064 \n\n158,894 \n155,559 \n155,537 \n156,552 \n161,868 \n162,780 \n164,012 \n165,876 \n165,118 \n166,136 \n\n74.5% \n78.4% \n78.9% \n81.1% \n80.8% \n79.3% \n81.4% \n83.1% \n83.9% \n84.3% \n\n40,493 \n33,640 \n32,822 \n29,618 \n31,011 \n33,647 \n30,459 \n28,103 \n26,537 \n26,072 \n\nPublic reporting \n\n A range of enrolment statistics are published regularly on the AEC website.\n\nDate: \nCleared by (FAC): \nTelephone: \nBranch: \nContact officer: \nTelephone: \nConsultation: \nPDR number: \n\n22 October 2019 \nTim Courtney for Andrew Gately \n(02) 6271 4410\nRoll Management and Community Engagement\nRobyn Legg\n(02) 6271 4786\nNil\nSB19-000044\n\nSB19-000044 \n\n3 \n\nLS7888 Released Document No. 41Released under the Freedom of Information Act 1982\fREDACTION CODES \n\nPersonal Information (name) redacted. \n\nPersonal Information (date of birth) redacted. \n\nPersonal Information (photograph) redacted \n\nPersonal Information (facsimile of signature) redacted. \n\nPersonal Information (facsimile of manuscript initialling) redacted. \n\nPersonal Information (Individual’s address) redacted. \n\nPersonal Information (individual’s telephone number) redacted. \n\nPersonal Information (individual’s opinion) redacted. \n\nPersonal Information (opinion about individual) redacted. \n\nPersonal Information (employment history) redacted. \n\nPersonal Information (qualifications) redacted. \n\nPersonal Information (health) redacted. \n\nPersonal Information (identifying individual) redacted. \n\nBusiness information (Bank Account details) redacted. \n\nBusiness information (Billing Account details) redacted. \n\nBusiness information (internal operations) redacted. \n\nLegal Professional Communication redacted. \n\nDeliberative material redacted. \n\nIrrelevant material redacted. \n\nElectoral Roll material redacted. \n\nTests, examinations or audits material redacted. \n\nManagement or assessment of personnel material redacted. \n\nProper and efficient conduct of the operations of AEC material redacted. \n\nLawful methods or procedures for preventing, detecting, investigating, or \ndealing with matters arising out of, breaches or evasions of the law. \n\nTrade Secrets. \n\nCommercial valuable information. \n\nFinancial interests of the Commonwealth. \n\nProperty interests of the Commonwealth. \n\n1 \n\n2 \n\n3 \n\n4 \n\n5 \n\n6 \n\n7 \n\n8 \n\n9 \n\n10 \n\n11 \n\n12 \n\n13 \n\n14 \n\n15 \n\n16 \n\n17 \n\n18 \n\n19 \n\n20 \n\n21 \n\n22 \n\n23 \n\n24 \n\n25 \n\n26 \n\n27 \n\n28 \n\n\f\n\nProvide only the markdown formatted summary text.
