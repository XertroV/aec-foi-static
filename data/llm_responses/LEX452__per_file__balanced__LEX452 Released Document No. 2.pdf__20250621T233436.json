These codes detail the specific categories of information that have been withheld, including various forms of personal information (e.g., name, address, signature, health details), business information (e.g., bank accounts, internal operations), legal professional communication, deliberative material, and information pertaining to the proper and efficient conduct of AEC operations or law enforcement procedures.\n\nIts relevance to FOI request LEX452 is crucial as it provides the explicit justification for the redactions observed in the other released documents (AEC letters) concerning Zi Chun Wang's disclosure obligations. While not containing information about the donations itself, this document clarifies *why* certain details are absent from the released materials, explaining the scope and limitations of the information provided in response to the FOI request."

Crucially, the final document (November 2014) acknowledges Zi Chun Wang's submission of the required Individual Donor Return, though the actual content of the disclosure itself is not included in the released materials, which also feature redactions.\n\nDocument Text:\n\nLEX452 Released Document No. 2Released under the Freedom of Information Act 1982\f\fREDACTION CODES \n\nPersonal Information (name) redacted. \n\nPersonal Information (date of birth) redacted. \n\nPersonal Information (photograph) redacted \n\nPersonal Information (facsimile of signature) redacted. \n\nPersonal Information (facsimile of manuscript initialling) redacted. \n\nPersonal Information (Individual’s address) redacted. \n\nPersonal Information (individual’s telephone number) redacted. \n\nPersonal Information (individual’s opinion) redacted. \n\nPersonal Information (opinion about individual) redacted. \n\nPersonal Information (employment history) redacted. \n\nPersonal Information (qualifications) redacted. \n\nPersonal Information (health) redacted. \n\nPersonal Information (identifying individual) redacted. \n\nBusiness information (Bank Account details) redacted. \n\nBusiness information (Billing Account details) redacted. \n\nBusiness information (internal operations) redacted. \n\nLegal Professional Communication redacted. \n\nDeliberative material redacted. \n\nIrrelevant material redacted. \n\nElectoral Roll material redacted. \n\nTests, examinations or audits material redacted. \n\nManagement or assessment of personnel material redacted. \n\nProper and efficient conduct of the operations of AEC material redacted. \n\nLawful methods or procedures for preventing, detecting, investigating, or \ndealing with matters arising out of, breaches or evasions of the law. \n\n1 \n\n2 \n\n3 \n\n4 \n\n5 \n\n6 \n\n7 \n\n8 \n\n9 \n\n10 \n\n11 \n\n12 \n\n13 \n\n14 \n\n15 \n\n16 \n\n17 \n\n18 \n\n19 \n\n20 \n\n21 \n\n22 \n\n23 \n\n24 \n\n\f\n\nProvide only the markdown formatted summary text.
