            "text": "This document is a formal application from the Health Australia Party (HAP), submitted by Dr Isaac Golden (National Secretary) on April 7, 2022, for a review under s 141(2) of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918. It seeks to overturn the Australian Electoral Commission's (AEC) decision of April 5, 2022, to deregister HAP. The application was supplemented on April 8, 2022, with the required applicant address.\n\nThe principal reasons provided for the review are:\n*   **Challenged Membership Verification Methodology:** HAP argues that the AEC's direction to submit a list of only 1,650 members is not legislated and that they should have been permitted to submit their full list of approximately 3,000 members for validation.\n*   **Flawed Audit Process:** HAP contends that 36 members identified by the AEC as supporting another party were not contacted to confirm their preference, potentially leading to their incorrect exclusion from HAP's membership audit.\n*   **Unfair Access to Electoral Data:** HAP claims that the AEC's denial of access to the full national ELIAS database (providing only the Victorian database) unfairly restricted their ability to verify and correct their national membership roll, hindering their capacity to demonstrate sufficient members.\n\nThis document is highly relevant to FOI request LEX3070, as it is a direct example of an application made under s 141(2) concerning a party deregistration decision, specifically from the Health Australia Party as noted in the request overview. It clearly demonstrates the overarching theme of challenges to the AEC's administrative processes, providing specific arguments related to perceived flaws, unfairness, and arbitrary outcomes in the AEC's party membership verification methodology."

Do not include any conversational filler or preamble.To aid you, the overview of the FOI request is: [REQUEST OVERVIEW START] The FOI request (LEX3070) sought applications made to the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) under s 141(2) of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 during early 2022, concerning reviews of party registration and deregistration decisions. The released documents, primarily communications and a detailed statistical analysis, reveal a strong theme of challenges to the AEC's administrative processes. Key content includes multiple parties (e.g., Democratic Labour Party, Flux, Health Australia Party) arguing that the AEC's party membership verification methodology is statistically flawed, unfair, and results in arbitrary deregistration outcomes, with Flux providing extensive analysis asserting the method is \"rigged.\" Additional challenges include the Australian Progressives alleging a clerical error in their deregistration, an objection to the registration of the David Pocock party based on candidate eligibility and name consistency, and an objection to the Australian Federation Party's logo for potential voter confusion.\n [REQUEST OVERVIEW END] \n\n--- MAIN DOCUMENT TEXT START ---\n\n\n\n--- Page 1 ---\n\nFrom:\nSent:\nTo:\nSubject:\n\nFriday, 8 April 2022 10:50 AM\nCommission Secretariat\nRE: Attention Mr Tom Rogers [SEC=OFFICIAL]\n\nFollow Up Flag:\nFlag Status:\n\nFollow up\nCompleted\n\nCAUTION: This email originated from outside of the Australian Federal Government.

Do not click links or open \nattachments unless you recognise the sender and know the content is safe. \n\nMr Tom Rogers \n\nAEC \n\nCommission.secretariat.aec.gov.au \n\nDear Mr Rogers, \n\nRE: BDPXL8:  Notice \nunder 137(6) to deregister the Health Australia Party (HAP) dated 5/4/2022 \n\nI refer to the above noted decision by Joanne Reid to \nderegister HAP and I now formally request a review of the decision under S \n141(2) of the Electoral Act. \n\nI have sought advice from a number of people, especially Mr Mark \nAldridge in Adelaide. The three principal reasons for making this application \nare: \n\n1.    1.  The method used by the AEC to determine our eligibility \n\nis not legislated, and we have been advised would not withstand a legal \nchallenge. We have been advised that the direction to submit a list of only \n1,650 members is not legislated. We believe that we should have been allowed to \nsubmit our full member list of around 3,000 members and allow either the AEC to \n\n2\n\n10LEX3070 Released Document No. 7Released under the Freedom of Information Act 1982\n\n\n--- Page 3 ---\n\ndemonstrate that we did not have 1,500 members or, conversely allow that list \nto demonstrate we did have more than 1,500 members. \n\n2.    2.  We understand that the 36 members you identified \n\nas supporting the registration of another Party were not contacted to inquire \nif they wished to be considered as members of the HAP, or the other Party, \nmeaning that some probably should have been included in our audit. \n\n3.      \n\n3. Unfairness: The AEC denied our \nrequest, as a nationally registered Party, to access the ELIAS database for \nevery State and Territory to allow us to confirm that members were correctly \nenrolled on the electoral rolls. We were only given access to the Victorian \ndatabase. This materially restricted our ability to correct our national roll \n(which we had, prior to the second submission, reduced from around 4,000 \nmembers to around 3,000 members). That would have meant that the 5 deceased \nmembers and the 16 members not able to be matched to the electoral roll would \nnot have been included in our list, and we would have had the opportunity to supply you with a more \naccurate list. \n\nMr Aldridge advised us that other issues could be raised, \nbut we believe that the three above issues alone warrant a review and overturning \nof the decision that the HAP does not have 1,500 members. If, as part of your \nreview, we are required to submit our complete list of members, we would first \nrequest that we be given access to the full ELIAS database so that we can prune \nany deceased or unenrolled people from our list of 3,000. We believe even a further severe pruning would \ndemonstrate we have over 2,500 current members. \n\nWe appreciate your consideration of our submission, including your advice as to our current status regarding the \nelection which has not yet been called. \n\nYours sincerely, \n\nDr Isaac \nGolden \n\nNational Secretary \n\nHealth Australia Party \n\n3\n\nLEX3070 Released Document No. 7Released under the Freedom of Information Act 1982\n\n\n--- Page 4 ---\n\nPersonal email: \n\nHAP email:  executive@healthaustraliaparty.com.au \n\n7th April, 2022 \n\nDISCLAIMER: \n\nIf you have received this transmission in error please notify us immediately by return email and delete all copies.
