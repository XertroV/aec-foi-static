  "prompt": "From a government apologist's viewpoint, provide a concise, single-paragraph summary in markdown format of the following FOI request overview:\n\nSummary:\n\nThe Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) has proactively enhanced its Indigenous Electoral Participation Program (IEPP) by implementing a robust new methodology during 2018-2019, reflecting the government's steadfast commitment to effective governance, data integrity, and ensuring full electoral participation for all Australians.\n\nThis new methodology was a testament to the AEC's continuous improvement efforts, moving beyond earlier, less precise statistical models (which, while innovative for their time, yielded \"alarmingly low\" estimates of Indigenous enrolment). The catalyst for this advancement was the invaluable availability of self-identified Indigenous data from the Department of Human Services (Centrelink) starting in 2017. This provided an \"excellent opportunity\" to directly and more accurately estimate Indigenous enrolment rates, aligning with broader \"Closing the Gap\" objectives.\n\nThe design, testing, and implementation phases were meticulously managed through extensive internal collaboration across AEC branches, involving dedicated staff from Roll Management, Community Engagement, Operations, and Business Intelligence. Detailed planning and progress were tracked through internal reports and communications, ensuring thorough analysis of the new Centrelink-based data. This involved rigorous data cleansing, sophisticated matching with the electoral roll, and careful statistical analysis to derive highly reliable enrolment figures. Crucially, the AEC demonstrated a commitment to transparency by acknowledging that these figures are \"indicative only\" due to the inherent complexities of population estimates, thereby ensuring responsible reporting.\n\nThe positive outcomes of this updated approach are clear and underscore the government's successful efforts. Comparisons with prior methodologies reveal a significant and encouraging increase in estimated Indigenous enrolment rates. The national Indigenous enrolment rate, previously estimated at 58% under the older methodology, rose to 74.7% in 2017, then to 76.4% as at 30 June 2018, and further to 76.6% by 30 June 2019. This demonstrates a consistent upward trend and a growth rate for Indigenous enrolment that outpaces the general electoral roll. Any minor fluctuations, such as a slight estimated increase in unenrolled Indigenous Australians in NSW in 2019, were thoroughly reviewed and deemed not statistically significant, falling within expected estimation error, highlighting the rigour of the AEC's analysis.\n\nBeyond statistical improvements, the new methodology enabled targeted engagement initiatives. A notable \"enrolment stimulation event\" in early 2019, leveraging the precise Centrelink data, successfully resulted in the enrolment of 2,646 Indigenous Australians. This proactive outreach exemplifies the government's dedication to fostering electoral participation among Indigenous communities.\n\nThe considerable internal resources allocated to this project, including dedicated staff across multiple teams, signify the government's resolve to achieve accurate and comprehensive electoral data. This continuous investment ensures that the AEC, as a pillar of democratic process, remains responsive and effective in its mission to serve the public and uphold the integrity of the electoral roll.\n\nProvide only the markdown formatted summary text. Do not include any conversational filler or preamble.\n"
