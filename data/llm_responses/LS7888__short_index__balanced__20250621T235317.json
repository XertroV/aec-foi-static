The released documents reveal the AEC transitioned to a more direct method for estimating Indigenous electoral enrolment rates, primarily by utilising self-identified Indigeneity data from Centrelink. This shift, driven by the availability of new Centrelink data, significantly increased estimated Indigenous enrolment rates from approximately 58% (under the old 2014 methodology) to 76.4% by June 2018 and 76.6% by June 2019. The documents detail the new methodology, its impact, and efforts to track enrolment stimulation, including identifying over 72,000 potentially unenrolled Indigenous Australians in mid-2018 and subsequent enrolment events. However, the released content did not explicitly detail the number of Indigenous people involved in the methodology's development or its final costs and dedicated AEC staffing."

  "prompt": "Create a concise, single-paragraph summary in markdown format of the following FOI request summary:\n\nSummary:\n\nThe following is a summary of the FOI request LS7888 and its associated released documents:\n\n### Main Purpose of the FOI Request\n\nThe Freedom of Information (FOI) request LS7888 sought documents from January 1, 2018, to December 31, 2019, concerning the Australian Electoral Commission's (AEC) new methodology for its Indigenous Electoral Participation Program (IEPP). Specifically, the request aimed to uncover:\n*   Planning documents and the catalyst for the new methodology.\n*   Progress reports and internal communications regarding its design, testing, and implementation.\n*   Details on how implementation was tracked, including comparisons with prior methodologies.\n*   Final summary reports on the outcomes.\n*   Information on the number of Indigenous people involved in the planning, design, and implementation.\n*   The final cost of the methodology's design, testing, and implementation, including AEC staffer numbers.\n\n### Documents from the FOI Request\n\nThe released documents comprise a schedule of 41 items (some subsuming others) and several redacted document excerpts. The types of documents include:\n*   **Internal Emails:** Correspondence between various AEC staff members (Assistant Directors, Directors, Senior Project Officers, Consultants, Data Analysts) discussing Indigenous data, enrolment rates, parliamentary reviews, and ministerial briefings.\n*   **Papers/Reports:** Documents titled \"Indigenous Franchise KPIs using Centrelink data\" and \"Analysis of Indigenous Enrolment.\"\n*   **Ministerial Submissions & Briefs:** Formal documents prepared for Ministers and parliamentary estimates hearings (e.g., \"Ministerial Submission re Publication of Indigenous enrolment rates,\" \"Estimates Brief – Hot Issue re Indigenous,\" \"Estimates Brief – Hot Issue – Supplementary Budget Estimates\").\n*   **Redaction Codes List:** A list detailing the types of information redacted from the documents.\n\n### Main Content from the FOI Request Documents\n\nThe core content of the released documents focuses heavily on the AEC's shift to a new, more direct methodology for estimating Indigenous electoral enrolment rates, primarily leveraging self-identified Indigeneity data from Centrelink (Department of Human Services).\n\n**Key Insights from the Documents:**\n\n*   **Catalyst for New Methodology:** The availability of person-level Centrelink extracts that included an Indigenous indicator from 2017 onwards was the primary catalyst. Previously, the AEC used an indirect regression model, which yielded \"alarmingly low\" and less robust Indigenous enrolment rates.\n*   **New Methodology Details:** The new approach involves:\n    *   Calculating the proportion of Centrelink customers (with identified Indigenous or non-Indigenous status) who are on the electoral roll.\n    *   Adjusting these raw Centrelink-based rates to align with overall AEC enrolment rates, applying this factor to Indigenous and non-Indigenous data.\n    *   The methodology aims to provide more direct and robust estimates, though it still relies on assumptions (e.g., no bias in Centrelink client enrolment or matching for Indigenous/non-Indigenous individuals).\n*   **Improved Enrolment Rates:** The new methodology revealed significantly higher estimated Indigenous enrolment rates:\n    *   As at June 30, 2018, the national Indigenous enrolment rate was estimated at **76.4%**. This was a substantial increase from the previous estimates of **58%** (calculated in 2014 using the old methodology).\n    *   As at June 30, 2019, the national rate remained steady at **76.6%**, continuing an upward trend from 74.7% in 2017.\n    *   The estimated unenrolled Indigenous population was around 118,581 in June 2018, increasing slightly to 120,486 by June 2019.\n*   **Implementation Tracking & Enrolment Stimulation:**\n    *   The Centrelink data identified 72,451 \"potentially unenrolled Indigenous Australians\" in July 2018.\n    *   An enrolment stimulation event in February/March 2019 resulted in 2,646 Indigenous Australians enrolling, reducing the identified unenrolled cohort to 69,143.\n    *   Internal discussions reveal efforts to refine the data analysis, particularly concerning older Indigenous Australians and potential matching errors.\n    *   There were internal discussions (emails from Sept 2019) about state-level variations, such as a noted increase in the unenrolled Indigenous population in NSW, though it was deemed not statistically significant given the state's size.\n*   **Reporting and Transparency:** The AEC prepared ministerial submissions and estimates briefs to communicate these updated enrolment figures to the government and parliament, emphasizing the improved methodology and increased rates. Discussions noted the importance of clearly stating the estimated nature of the data (\"estimates on top of estimates\") due to the lack of a direct Indigenous identifier on the federal roll.\n\n**Information Not Explicitly Addressed in Released Content:**\n\n*   The documents do not explicitly outline the **number of Indigenous people involved by the AEC in the planning, design, and implementation** of the new methodology in terms of project personnel or consultants.\n*   The documents also do not detail the **final cost of the design, testing, and implementation of the new methodology, nor the specific number of AEC staffers assigned to the task.** While staff names and roles appear in emails, a dedicated breakdown of staffing or costs for the project is not present in the provided snippets or document descriptions.\n\nProvide only the markdown formatted summary text. Do not include any conversational filler or preamble."
