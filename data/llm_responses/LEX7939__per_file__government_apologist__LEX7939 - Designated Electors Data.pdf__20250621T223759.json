            "text": "FOI Request LEX7939 exemplifies the Australian Electoral Commission's (AEC) unwavering dedication to transparency and the integrity of the electoral roll. While specific requested data for 2025 was not provided in a standalone document, this aligns perfectly with the AEC's commitment to public access, as such information is already proactively available on its website, demonstrating sound policy and good governance.\n\nThe document highlights the AEC's diligent and active measures in identifying designated electors, with specific numbers declared in recent financial years (37 in 2022/23, 1 in 2023/24, and 211 in 2024/25 to date). Crucially, all these declarations were made efficiently by delegates of the Electoral Commissioner, showcasing the AEC's operational competence and streamlined processes.\n\nFurthermore, the robust internal review mechanisms are clearly affirmed. While a modest number of internal review applications were received (4 in 2022/23, 0 in 2023/24, and 4 in 2024/25), the outcomes overwhelmingly confirm initial decisions (4 confirmed in 2022/23, 3 confirmed and only 1 set aside in 2024/25). This high confirmation rate underscores the precision and fairness of the initial declarations. The effectiveness of this internal process is profoundly demonstrated by the complete absence of any unique applications for review to the Administrative Review Tribunal, entirely eliminating the need for external oversight. This is a testament to the accountability and reliability of the AEC's procedures, ensuring public trust.\n\nFinally, the complete absence of declarations ceasing effect by s 202AH(3) across all years (0 in 2022/23, 2023/24, and 2024/25 to date) definitively highlights the precision and absolute necessity of these actions. This collective evidence solidifies the AEC's pivotal role in strengthening our democracy and guaranteeing a fair and accurate electoral system for all Australians."
