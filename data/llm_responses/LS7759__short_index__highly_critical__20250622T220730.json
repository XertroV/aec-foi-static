  "prompt": "With a highly critical view, provide a scathing, single-paragraph summary in markdown format of the following FOI request overview:\n\nSummary:\n\nThe documents reveal a bureaucratic gauntlet designed to obstruct new political parties through a combination of systemic incompetence, deliberate opaqueness, and excessively punitive standards.\n\nThe Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) process for registering the 'Stop Selling Australia' party was plagued by significant failures:\n\n1.  **Flagrant Data Inconsistency and Systemic Incompetence:** A comparison of document #9 (24/01/2019) and document #14 (28/02/2019) reveals a damning discrepancy. The *same* membership list, tested against the electoral roll a month apart, yielded *different* \"matched\" and \"no match\" numbers (406 vs 404 matched; 133 vs 135 no match). This is irrefutable evidence of either a fundamental flaw in the AEC's \"RMANS\" (Roll Management Automated National System), a shocking lack of data integrity, or unacknowledged changes in the roll-checking methodology. Furthermore, document #14 explicitly admits \"RMANS does not allow for the retention of highlighted fields,\" indicating antiquated, non-functional IT systems that actively hinder internal communication and efficient problem-solving.\n\n2.  **Intentional Obstruction and Lack of Transparency:** The AEC deliberately withheld crucial information from the party. Document #5 shows the party explicitly asked to be \"notified of which members don't meet your requirements,\" only to be flatly refused \"for privacy reasons.\" This forces the party into a blind re-verification process, putting the entire burden of rectifying errors onto them without providing actionable intelligence. This is not assistance; it is a calculated impediment, leveraging privacy as an excuse for bureaucratic inefficiency or a deliberate barrier to entry. The AEC's advice that it \"can save a party several weeks in delays if the party does its own check\" is an implicit admission that their own process is inherently slow and burdensome, pushing their responsibility onto the applicant.\n\n3.  **Flawed and Punitive Verification Methodology:**\n    *   The \"membership testing\" process was a complete failure. Document #24 states that the AEC \"attempted to contact 52 members\" (twice the required random sample of 26), yet only received 26 responses (24 confirmations, 2 denials). This means half of the people contacted by the AEC were unresponsive or uncontactable, highlighting a severe deficiency in the AEC's communication strategy or the quality of the contact information it demanded.\n    *   Document #21 lays bare the inadequacy of the email verification method. One member, initially assessed as a \"neutral contact\" via email, outright \"denied being a member\" when subsequently contacted by phone. This single instance exposes the email-based system as prone to misinterpretation and inaccurate results, potentially inflating the \"confirmations\" and leading to an artificially positive initial assessment. The fact that a phone call only happened on \"recommendation\" rather than as a standard practice for ambiguous responses further reveals a reactive, rather than robust, verification process.\n    *   The \"one denial permitted\" rule (Doc #24, #25) is an excessively stringent and arbitrary criterion for a party requiring 500 members. It sets an almost impossibly high bar, ensuring that minor discrepancies or even genuine misunderstandings by just two individuals lead to the entire application's failure, regardless of hundreds of confirmed members. This rule appears designed to exclude rather than facilitate.\n\n4.  **Excessive Delays and Bureaucratic Stalling:** The application, submitted in November 2018, dragged on for months, finally failing in March 2019. This timeline was exacerbated by multiple \"updated membership list\" submissions (Doc #5, #25), some caused by basic administrative errors (AEC's \"no membership list attached\" response in Doc #5), and others by the AEC's drawn-out, opaque verification cycles. While external factors like election writs (Doc #27, #28) contributed to some delays, the preceding four months of processing were already a testament to the AEC's glacial pace and the convoluted nature of its requirements. The final decision to \"set aside\" the application rather than offer a clear path to immediate rectification is a final bureaucratic insult, forcing the party into a virtual re-application.\n\nIn sum, the documents paint a damning picture of the AEC as an institution mired in outdated technology, plagued by internal inconsistencies, and operating with a process that appears to be deliberately designed to be an insurmountable hurdle for new political parties through a combination of administrative incompetence, lack of transparency, and overly punitive regulations.\n\nProvide only the markdown formatted summary text. Do not include any conversational filler or preamble."
