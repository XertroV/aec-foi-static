            "text": "This document, titled \"STANDARD RESPONSES Secure telephone voting social media queries\" (May 2022), provides pre-approved communication scripts for the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) to address public inquiries regarding voting options during the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly for the 2022 federal election.\n\nIts primary focus is on clarifying procedures for **secure telephone voting**, detailing eligibility criteria (COVID-19 positive and isolating), online and phone registration processes, required proof of positive status (PCR/RAT details), operational hours, and ballot paper access. It also includes responses concerning potential service delays, vote security measures (operator read-back), and the counting of telephone votes. The document further addresses **postal voting policy** for COVID-positive individuals, including application deadlines, return methods, and witness requirements, as well as general inquiries about mandatory voting, alternatives for close contacts, and the absence of other voting locations. It highlights that telephone voting is an emergency measure and is not generally available.\n\nThis document is highly relevant to the FOI request LEX2846 as it directly demonstrates the AEC's implementation and communication strategy for the **Commonwealth Electoral (COVID Enfranchisement) Regulations 2022** and the associated **secure telephone voting system**. The \"Standard Responses\" serve as practical examples of the AEC's \"staff scripts\" and efforts to manage the \"Customer Journey\" for voters navigating COVID-impacted elections. It explicitly details adaptations to **postal voting policy** for COVID-positive individuals and implicitly reflects **logistical challenges** through its advisories on potential delays and busy phone lines. Furthermore, it touches upon maintaining integrity through witness requirements for postal votes and the secure process for telephone votes, aligning with the AEC's commitment to **COVID-safe measures** and robust voting methods."

The AEC also adapted its **postal voting policy** for COVID-positive individuals and noted reduced mobile polling. Revealed were significant **logistical and financial challenges**, including projected cost increases and staffing difficulties, prompting the AEC to seek greater legislative flexibility for emergency election management. The AEC ensured **COVID-safe measures** at polling places and maintained the integrity of new voting methods through staff neutrality, scrutineer observation, and robust complaint mechanisms.\n [REQUEST OVERVIEW END] \n\n--- MAIN DOCUMENT TEXT START ---\n\n\n\n--- Page 1 ---\n\nMay 2022 \n\nSTANDARD RESPONSES \nSecure telephone voting social media queries \n\nLast updated: 17 May 2022  \n\nApproved by:  Cathie Kennedy    \nPosition:     \nDate: \n\nDirector, Strategic Election Priorities Branch                     \n16 May 2022\n\n\n--- Page 2 ---\n\nContents \n\nFrom 8:00am Saturday 14 May – 6.00pm Wednesday 18 May ............................................. 2 \n\nFrom 6.00pm Wednesday 18 May – 6.00pm Saturday 21 May ............................................. 2 \n\n1\n\n\n--- Page 3 ---\n\nTOPIC/THEME \n\nRESPONSE \n\nFrom 8:00am Saturday 14 May – 6.00pm Wednesday 18 May \n\nI’m COVID-positive now. \nHow should I vote? \n\nYou can apply for a postal vote until 6pm Wed 18 May.
