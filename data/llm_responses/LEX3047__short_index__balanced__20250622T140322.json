The released materials include public email complaints and the AEC's responses to various entities like \"Our Vote Our Community\" and \"Bass Deserves Better\" Facebook pages, \"RiteOn!\" website, and other media. The complaints predominantly highlighted the absence of required authorisation details on political advertising across digital and print platforms, with some also raising concerns about misleading \"community group\" portrayals or unauthorised paid ads. In response, the AEC consistently clarified 'electoral matter' and authorisation requirements under the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918, requested subjects to add necessary authorisations, cease distribution of non-compliant materials, and advised on potential penalties up to $25,200 for non-compliance, as well as obligations for \"disclosure entities.\""

  "prompt": "Create a concise, single-paragraph summary in markdown format of the following FOI request summary:\n\nSummary:\n\nThe following is a summary of the documents released under FOI Request No. LEX3047:\n\n### Main Purpose of the FOI Request\nThe main purpose of the FOI request (LEX3047, dated 20 June 2022) was to obtain specific documents from the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) related to complaints concerning electoral advertisements. Specifically, the requester sought:\n*   A copy of the original complaint.\n*   The final AEC correspondence to the relevant third-party regarding the matter.\n\nThe request focused on complaints made mostly in April and May 2019 concerning a lack of authorisation on electoral advertisements, or in one instance, misleading and deceptive content.\n\n### Documents from the FOI Request\nThe released documents comprise:\n*   A \"Schedule of Released Documents\" listing the specific complaints for which documents were provided.\n*   Copies of email complaints submitted by members of the public to the AEC's Legal Services Mailbox or specific AEC personnel.\n*   Copies of email correspondence from the AEC's Authorisation Section to the individuals or entities that were the subject of the complaints.\n\nThe released documents correspond to complaints made against various entities, including:\n*   \"Our Vote Our Community\" Facebook Page\n*   \"Bass Deserves Better\" Facebook Page\n*   \"Outrage Institute\" Facebook Page\n*   \"RiteOn!\" website and social media\n*   \" for WILLS\" Facebook page\n*   \"Friends of the ABC\" website\n*   \"South Perth Progressive\" Facebook page\n*   \"Agents in their Community\" Facebook page\n*   \"Vote Tony Out\" Facebook page and website\n*   Unspecified \"Liberal Party\" other media\n*   An \"Independent candidate\" (website and print media)\n\n### Main Content from the FOI Request Documents\nThe released documents primarily detail complaints about the lack of proper authorisation on political advertising and the AEC's subsequent responses, largely focusing on compliance with the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918.\n\n**Key Themes from Complaints:**\n*   **Lack of Authorisation:** The vast majority of complaints allege that electoral matter, whether on Facebook pages, websites, or other media (online ads, newspaper ads, merchandise), lacked the required authorisation details (name and town/city of the authorising person/entity).\n*   **Misleading Nature:** Some complaints highlight that pages purporting to be \"community groups\" or \"apolitical\" were in fact engaged in partisan political campaigning without transparent authorisation, leading to concerns about misleading voters.\n*   **Paid Advertising:** Several complaints specifically note that paid advertisements were being run without authorisation.\n*   **Disclosure Entities:** Complaints occasionally touched upon whether the entity disseminating the information should be considered a \"disclosure entity\" under the Electoral Act, which would necessitate authorisation for all electoral communications.\n\n**Key Content from AEC Correspondence:**\n*   **Clarification of Requirements:** The AEC's responses consistently explain the definition of 'electoral matter' and the requirements for authorisation under the Electoral Act, particularly for paid advertisements and communications by 'disclosure entities' (e.g., registered political parties, candidates, or entities exceeding electoral expenditure thresholds).\n*   **Specific Observations and Requests:** For each complaint deemed valid, the AEC identifies the specific issues (e.g., unauthorised stickers, unapproved Facebook ads, missing website authorisations). They formally request the subject of the complaint to add the necessary authorisation (e.g., in the \"About\" section of social media pages, website footers) and, where applicable, to cease the sale or distribution of unauthorised material.\n*   **Consequences of Non-Compliance:** The AEC often informs the recipients of potential penalties for non-compliance (e.g., up to $25,200) and the possibility of injunctions being sought by other nominated candidates if the non-compliance persists after an election is called.\n*   **Guidance on Disclosure Entities:** The AEC advises entities that if their electoral expenditure exceeds the disclosure threshold (e.g., $13,800), they would become a \"disclosure entity\" with further obligations, including providing disclosure returns and authorising all electoral communications.\n\nProvide only the markdown formatted summary text. Do not include any conversational filler or preamble."
