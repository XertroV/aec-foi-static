            "text": "This document collection comprises internal and external communications from the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) pertaining to the deregistration of the political party VOTEFLUX.ORG | Upgrade Democracy! (VFUD). It provides detailed context and documentation relevant to the FOI request regarding VFUD's deregistration due to failing the 1,500-member threshold.\n\nKey points include:\n\n*   **Initial Deregistration Decision:** On March 24, 2022 (Document 2), an AEC delegate formally deregistered VFUD under s 137(6)(a) of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918, stating the party failed to demonstrate it had at least 1,500 members. This decision was based on the outcomes of membership testing both a December 2021 list and a February 2022 list.\n*   **First Membership Test Failure:** In response to an s 138A(3) notice, VFUD submitted a list of 1,649 members on December 7, 2021. Membership testing of this list resulted in 9 denials against a permitted maximum of 7, leading to a \"FAIL\" outcome (Document 23). This constitutes the \"definitive failure of VFUD's *first* membership test\" as per the FOI request overview.\n*   **VFUD's Challenge and Second Membership List:** Following the initial deregistration notice (s 137(1)), VFUD responded on February 13, 2022, providing a statement and an additional list of 4,680 members (Document 18). VFUD contended the AEC's statistical testing methodology was flawed, arguing it had a significant false negative rate (e.g., 10.5% for \"borderline cases\") and artificially reduced sample size by limiting submitted lists to 1,650, leading to \"significant errors\" and predetermined outcomes.\n*   **Procedural Error in Second Test:** Despite VFUD submitting 4,680 names, an internal AEC instruction dated March 2, 2022, directed that only the *top 1,650 names* from this list be tested \"to conform with our testing methodology parameters\" (Document 19). VFUD's subsequent application for review (Document 4) highlighted that this list was alphabetically sorted, meaning the AEC effectively conducted a non-random sample from only members whose first names started with A through G.\n*   **Statistical Validity of Second Test:** Later advice from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) (Document 24) confirmed that due to the non-random selection, it was \"not possible to draw any meaningful statistical conclusions about the Party’s whole list of 4680 from the results of testing the sub-list. You can only say something about the selected 1650.\" This supports the FOI request overview's statement that the Commission placed \"no weight\" on the second list's results due to the \"departure from the methodology.\"\n*   **Internal Review Process:** Multiple applications for internal review were lodged by VFUD and its members (Documents 4, 5, 6), reiterating concerns about the flawed methodology, the high false negative rate, and the biased sampling of the second list. The AEC confirmed receipt and outlined the internal review process, noting that applications could not be processed during the federal election writ period (Documents 8, 21, 22).\n\nThe documents collectively demonstrate the sequence of events leading to VFUD's deregistration, the party's consistent challenge to the AEC's membership testing methodology, and the AEC's internal acknowledgment of a procedural error in handling VFUD's second membership list, directly aligning with the details provided in the FOI request overview."

Do not include any conversational filler or preamble.To aid you, the overview of the FOI request is: [REQUEST OVERVIEW START] The FOI request concerned the deregistration of the political party VOTEFLUX.ORG | Upgrade Democracy! (VFUD) by the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) for failing to meet the mandatory 1,500-member threshold. This decision stemmed from VFUD's submitted membership lists failing the AEC's statistical testing methodology, which the party contended was fundamentally flawed, particularly after a procedural error saw the delegate non-randomly test only 1,650 names from a larger 4,680-member list. During the subsequent internal review, the AEC Commission affirmed the deregistration, critically acknowledging that the delegate's non-random testing of the second list was a \"departure from the methodology\" and placed \"no weight\" on its results. However, the deregistration was upheld based on the definitive failure of VFUD's *first* membership test and the party's subsequent failure to provide a properly testable list within the AEC's established, resource-constrained methodology.\n [REQUEST OVERVIEW END] \n\n--- MAIN DOCUMENT TEXT START ---\n\n\n\n--- Page 1 ---\n\nDocument No 2 \n\nNOTICE OF DECISION ON PARTY REGISTRATION \nDEREGISTERING A POLITICAL PARTY AND REMOVAL FROM THE \nREGISTER OF POLITICAL PARTIES  \nVOTEFLUX.ORG | UPGRADE DEMOCRACY! \n\nNotice of decision under s 137(6) of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 \n(Electoral Act) and Statement of Reasons \n\nI am writing in accordance with s 137(6)(b) of the Electoral Act to notify you of the review\nconducted under s 138A(1) of the Electoral Act and the determination to deregister\nVOTEFLUX.ORG | Upgrade Democracy! (the Party) and cancel the Party’s particulars from\nthe Register of Political Parties (the Register).\n\nAs a delegate of the Electoral Commission, I am authorised to deregister the Party under\ns 137(6)(a) of the Electoral Act, and to cancel the particulars of the Party on the Register\nunder s 138 of the Electoral Act.\n\nOn 8 October 2021, the Electoral Commission issued a Notice to the Registered Officer of\nthe Party, Mr Nathan Spataro, under s 138A(3) of the Electoral Act (s 138A Notice). This\nNotice requested the Party provide the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) with an\nelectronic membership list of between 1,500 and 1,650 members in order for the AEC to\ndetermine the eligibility of the Party to remain registered. The due date for responding was\n8 December 2021.\n\nOn 26 November 2021, I sent a reminder to the Party outlining the requirements of the\ns 138A Notice.\n\nOn 7 December 2021, the Party responded to the s 138A Notice providing a list of 1,649\nindividuals the Party considers to be members of the Party.\n\nOn 13 January 2022, the Party was issued with a notice under s 137(1) of the Electoral Act\n(the s 137 Notice), that I, as the delegate of the Electoral Commission, was satisfied on\nreasonable grounds that the Party does not have at least 1,500 members. Pursuant to\ns 137(2) of the Electoral Act, the Party was provided with one month to respond to the\ns 137 Notice (being 13 February 2022).\n\nOn 13 February 2022, the Registered Officer of the Party, Mr Spataro, provided a statement\nin accordance with s 137(2) of the Electoral Act, and an additional list of 4,680 individuals\nthe Party considers to be members.\n\n1.\n\n2.\n\n3.\n\n4.\n\n5.\n\n6.\n\n7.\n\n8.\n\nSection 137(5) of the Electoral Act prescribes that:\n\nWhere, in response to a notice given under s 137(1) in relation to a political party, \na statement is lodged under s 137(2), the Electoral Commission shall consider that \nstatement and determine whether the political party should be deregistered for the \nreason set out in that notice. \n\nDecision \n\n9.\n\nAs a delegate of the Electoral Commission, I am satisfied on reasonable grounds that the\nParty does not have at least 1,500 members, and the Party should be deregistered.\n\nStatement of Reasons \n\nPage 1 \n\n1\n\n\n--- Page 2 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 3 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 4 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 5 ---\n\n27.\n\n28.\n\n29.\n\n30.\n\n31.\n\n32.\n\n33.\n\n34.\n\nThe Party failed membership testing for exceeding the maximum number of permitted\ndenials according to the ABS methodology used by the AEC. It did not fail membership\ntesting due to having an insufficient number of members being identified on the electoral roll.\n\nThe Electoral Act defines an elector as someone that is on the Commonwealth Electoral\nRoll. Section 123 of the Electoral Act prescribes that an eligible political party, not being a\nParliamentary party, has ‘at least 1,500 members’. The requirement is not to be solely ‘an\nelector’ but to be a member of the party.\n\nThe Party challenges the validity of the AEC’s membership testing process. This process\nhas been developed by the AEC to support the delegate’s consideration of whether a party\nhas sufficient members. It is based on sampling methodology designed in consultation with\nthe ABS and provides a valid methodology to satisfy a delegate of a party’s membership.\nThe Electoral Commission has previously concluded that the methodology ‘was appropriate\nfor membership testing, including because it was rational, fair and practical in all the\ncircumstances.’1\n\nI consider that the membership testing results outlined above provide a more robust method\nfor ascertaining whether a party has satisfied the requirements of the Electoral Act than a\nstatement provided by the party.\n\nIn summary, I remain satisfied that the Party does not have at least 1,500 members based\non the outcomes from membership testing both membership lists of 7 December 2021 and\n13 February 2022.\n\nAccordingly, in my capacity as a delegate of the Electoral Commission, I have deregistered\nVOTEFLUX.ORG | Upgrade Democracy! under s 137(6) of the Electoral Act and the\nparticulars of the Party have been cancelled from the Register under s 138 of the Electoral\nAct.\n\nReview rights\n\nUnder s 141(2) of the Electoral Act, a person (including an organisation) affected by the\ndecision who is dissatisfied with the decision may make a written application to the Electoral\nCommission for internal review of this decision within 28 days after the day on which the\ndecision first comes to the notice of that person. There is no fee payable for requesting an\ninternal review.\n\nRequests for review of this decision should be addressed to Mr Tom Rogers,\nAustralian Electoral Commissioner, and emailed to commission.secretariat@aec.gov.au or\nposted to Locked Bag 4007, Canberra City ACT 2601.\n\n1\n\nhttps://www.aec.gov.au/Parties and Representatives/Party Registration/Registration Decisions/202\n1/notice-of-decision-with-reasons-SUPA.pdf  \n\nStatement of Reasons \n\nPage 5 \n\n5\n\n\n--- Page 6 ---\n\nHow do I request an internal review? \n\n35.\n\nIn accordance with ss 141(2) and 141(3) of the Electoral Act, an application for review must:\n\n•\n•\n•\n•\n\nbe in writing;\nspecify the name of the applicant;\nspecify an address of the applicant; and\nset out the reasons for making the application.\n\n36.\n\n37.\n\n38.\n\n39.\n\nIf you wish to apply for additional time beyond the 28 days to make an application for review\nof the delegate’s decision, please also include the reasons for the application for additional\ntime.\n\nWho conducts an internal review?\n\nThe Electoral Commission, which is comprised of three members, the Australian Electoral\nCommissioner, a judicial member and a non-judicial member, conducts internal reviews.\nUnder s 141(4) of the Electoral Act, the Electoral Commission shall review an application\nand make a decision to either:\n\n•\n•\n•\n\naffirm the decision under review;\nvary the decision under review; or\nset aside the decision under review and make a decision in substitution for the\ndecision set aside.\n\nWhat can I do if I disagree with the outcome of an internal review? \n\nIf an internal review decision has been made by the Electoral Commission a person whose\ninterests are affected, and who is dissatisfied with the decision made by the Electoral\nCommission, may apply to the AAT for an external merits review of the decision.

(the Party) \n\nPurpose \n\nThis minute asks you, as a delegate of the Electoral Commission, to deregister the Party under \ns 137(6) of the Electoral Act on the grounds that the Party does not have at least 1,500 members \n(s 137(1)(b) of the Electoral Act).  \n\nAuthority \n\nSections 123, 137, 138 and 138A of the Electoral Act. \n\nBackground \n\nOn 13 January 2022, you, as a delegate of the Electoral Commission, issued a notice to the \nRegistered Officer of the Party, Mr Nathan Spataro, under s 137 of the Electoral Act (the s 137 \nNotice) stating that the Electoral Commission is considering deregistering the Party (OBJECT IDs: \nA1319272 and A1442167). The Registered Officer of the Party had until 13 February 2022 to provide \na response.  \n\nOn 13 February 2022, the Party responded to the s 137 Notice: \n\n• Response received – OBJECT ID: A1369037\n• Statement – OBJECT ID: A1369035\n• Supplementary membership list – OBJECT ID: A1369039\n\nOn 2 March 2022, you, as a delegate of the Electoral Commission, having considered the statement \nlodged by the Party, and membership list lodged in support of that statement containing 4,680 \nnames, requested that further membership testing be performed. In confirming your advice, you \ninstructed to select the top 1,650 names for testing to conform with the AEC’s testing methodology \nparameters.

The Party’s logo \npassed validation and has been assessed by CRE8IVE (OBJECT IDs: A1421693 and A1421695). If \nthe Party is deregistered, the application lodged under s 134 of the Electoral Act will no longer be \nvalid. \n\nConclusion \n\nOn 13 January 2022, a notice was issued a notice to the Registered Officer of the Party under s 137 \nof the Electoral Act stating that the Electoral Commission is considering deregistering the Party \n\nOn 13 February 2022, the party responded to the s 137 Notice providing a statement and a \nmembership list in support of that statement. \n\nAn assessment of the Party’s membership list was undertaken and based on the ABS methodology it \ndemonstrated that the Party has failed to demonstrate to have at least 1,500 members.  \n\nAccordingly, there are reasonable grounds on which you, as the delegate of the Electoral \nCommission, can be satisfied that the Party does not have at least 1,500 members. Based on this \ninformation, you may determine under s 138A of the Electoral Act that the Party is not an ‘eligible \npolitical party’ and should be deregistered. \n\nIf you, as the delegate of the Electoral Commission is of this view, you should not deregister the \nParty under s 137 of the Electoral Act and advise the Registered Officer of this decision.  \n\nMinute \n\nPage 4 \n\n10\n\n\n--- Page 11 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 12 ---\n\nDocument No 4\n\nFrom:\nTo:\nSubject:\nDate:\nAttachments:\n\nCommission Secretariat\nrequest for review under s141(2)\nThursday, 14 April 2022 10:03:25 AM\naec-request-review-with-stats-paper-final.pdf\n\nCAUTION: This email originated from outside of the Australian Federal Government.

email originated from outside of the Australian Federal Government. Do\nnot click links or open attachments unless you recognise the sender and know the content\nis safe.\n\nAttention: Mr Tom Rogers - Australian Electoral Commissioner\n\nDear Mr Tom Rogers,\n\nI am writing to request a review of the decision to deregister VOTEFLUX.ORG |Upgrade\nDemocracy! (hereafter Flux) under Under s 141(2) of the Electoral Act. I only learned of\nthe deregistration from the party on 20th April 2022.\n\nI am a member of the party who was contacted by the AEC via email on the 16th March\n2022 to confirm my membership of the Flux party. The AEC sent that email from the\nfollowing address: PartyMembership-Testing@aec.gov.au (hereafter the 'testing email\naddress'). I responded via email in the affirmative to confirm I am a member of the party. I\nhave not received any further correspondence from the AEC to confirm my response was\ncounted and included as part of their membership testing exercise. That is despite the fact I\nsent an additional email to the AEC requesting confirmation that my response had been\ncounted.\n\nI am asking the AEC now as part of this review process to confirm that:\n1. My response was included in the \"confirmed membership\" category. Please provide\ndocumentation to show this;\n2. any other members who asked to confirm their membership via the AEC's testing email\naddress also had their response correctly recorded;\n3. The date/s the AEC sent these emails to members and up until what date did the AEC\ncheck this email address for responses? Can the AEC be sure that it did not miss any\nresponses that may have been received after the AEC stopped checking for responses but\nwithin an allowable time? The membership testing correspondence received did not\nindicate the date by which responses had to be received so there is a risk members who\nwere contacted and did reply have had their confirmations received but ignored.\n\nIn addition to the points above, the email I received from the AEC made reference to a\n\"random sample.\" \nI am requesting a review into both this process and the statistical method used. I am\nconcerned that a random sample was not used because in the statement of reasons for\nderegistration the Assistant Commissioner stated they \"instructed that the top 1,650 names\nbe tested.\" That would be a biased sample \"slanted\" towards the first letters of the\nalphabet.\nI am asking the AEC to:\n4. Review that procedural errors may have occurred when taking a random sample from\nthe list of 4,680 members provided by Flux that led to a biased sample.\n\nIn regards to the statistical method used I am concerned about its reliability. \nI am asking the AEC to:\n5. share the mathematical proof of the sampling method used; and\n6. review the rate at which this method would return a false negative. Please share the\nresults of that review. Does the AEC consider the rate of false negatives to be acceptable?\n\n47s 47F (Personal Privacy)\n\n\n--- Page 48 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 49 ---\n\nAttachment No 6 \n\nFrom:\nTo:\nSubject:\nDate:\n\nCommission Secretariat\nPlease review your recent decision to deregister flux party.\nFriday, 6 May 2022 2:12:20 AM\n\nCAUTION: This email originated from outside of the Australian Federal Government.

The Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) maintains the Register of Political \nParties (the Register) and administers the Commonwealth party registration scheme on behalf \nof the Electoral Commission. The primary function of the scheme is to establish a register of \nparty names, abbreviations and logos that can be printed on ballot papers at elections for the \nSenate and House of Representatives. \n\nRegistration as a federal political party is not compulsory to contest federal elections. Unendorsed \n(independent) candidates can also nominate for election to the Commonwealth Parliament. \n\nThe benefits of registration as a federal political party include: \n\n▪ \n\nthe party’s registered name, registered abbreviation or registered logo may be printed \nnext to the names of its endorsed candidates and Senate groups on ballot papers \n\n▪  political parties can have additional registrations for their branches. Each branch \n\nregistered will need to separately prove its eligibility for registration \n\n▪ \n\n▪ \n\nthe registered officer or deputy registered officer of a political party can nominate the \nparty’s endorsed candidates without requiring the signatures of 100 electors in the \nparticular electorate. 100 electors are required to nominate an unendorsed \n(independent) candidate \n\nthe registered officer or deputy registered officer of a political party can make a bulk \nnomination of all the party’s House of Representatives candidates in respect of the \nDivisions situated in a particular State or Territory to the Australian Electoral Officer for \nthat State or Territory, without needing to nominate individually with each Divisional \nReturning Officer \n\n▪  election funding for endorsed candidates who receive at least four per cent of the formal \n\nfirst preference votes. The election funding entitlements of candidates who were \nendorsed by a registered political party are paid through the party agent \n\n▪  access to information held by the AEC including:  \n\no  electronic copies of the Commonwealth Electoral Roll (Electoral Roll) and \n\nadditional elector information, plus  \n\no  copies of the printed Electoral Roll voting information in relation to an election.  \n\nApplications to register a new political party must include all of the requirements for an \napplication to be accepted by the AEC for assessment (for example, the AEC cannot ‘reserve’ \nthe name of a political party on behalf of a prospective applicant who has not lodged all of the \nrequirements for a new political party application). \n\nThe guides incorporate text boxes to highlight important information.  \n\nThe ‘light bulb’ symbol indicates a useful tip. \n\nThe ‘note’ symbol indicates information relating to the Electoral Act. \n\nGuide for registering a party \n\nr  g s\n\n   p r\n\nd  \n\nPage 4 \n\n69\n\n\n--- Page 70 ---\n\nThe Guide for registering a party (Guide) is intended to assist people to understand the party \nregistration provisions of Part XI of the Electoral Act. It provides general guidance on the \nrequirements and process for registering a political party. \n\nThe Guide for maintaining party registration provides general guidance on the requirements and \nprocess for: \n\n▪  maintaining party registration \n\n▪  changing party details and party officers \n\n▪  deregistration of political parties. \n\nThese guides are part of a series of publications to help parties better understand the \nrequirements of the party registration, election funding, and financial disclosure provisions of the \nElectoral Act. \n\nThe guides provide information derived from the Electoral Act as well as from the experience of \nthe AEC in the administration of its provisions. \n\nWhile these guides are intended to act as user-friendly guides to the requirements of the \nElectoral Act, they cannot fully address every possible issue that may arise. \n\nImportantly, do not use the guides as a substitute for legal advice on specific detailed \ncompliance, disclosure, and party registration issues. Users are urged to seek their own \nindependent advice where necessary and to read and familiarise themselves with the relevant \nparts of the Electoral Act. \n\nOn 3 September 2021, amendments to the Electoral Act under the Electoral Legislation \nAmendment (Party Registration Integrity) Act 2021, came into effect . For further information \nsee Party registration guidance on the AEC website and the Electoral Act. \n\nGuide for registering a party \n\nr  g s\n\n   p r\n\nd  \n\nPage 5 \n\n70\n\n\n--- Page 71 ---\n\nEligibility requirements for registration \n\nA new party must meet the eligibility requirements for political party registration \nunder section 126 of the Electoral Act. \n\nAll federally registered political parties must meet the eligibility requirements for political party \nregistration on an ongoing basis. These requirements include: \n\n▪\n\n▪\n\nbeing an organisation with an aim of endorsing candidates for election to the Senate\nand/or House of Representatives\n\nhaving:\n\no at least 1,500 members who are on the Electoral Roll and who are not also relied\n\nupon by another party for registration purposes, or\n\no at least one member of the party who is a Senator or Member of the House of\nRepresentatives in the Parliament of the Commonwealth and not a member of\nanother party.\n\nKey elements of an application \n\nA new party applying for registration must: \n\n▪\n\n▪\n\n▪\n\n▪\n\n▪\n\n▪\n\nsubmit a written constitution\n\nsubmit a party name\n\nset out the party’s proposed registered officer\n\nstate whether it wishes to receive election funding\n\nstate the supporting applicants\n\nsubmit a $500 application fee\n\n▪ And either:\n\no a membership list containing at least 1,500 members, or\n\no provide supporting evidence from the party’s Senator or Member.\n\nA new party applying for registration may optionally submit an abbreviation \nof the party’s name and/or a logo. \n\nThese submissions must meet the requirements of the Electoral Act. There is a detailed \ndescription of the requirements for names, abbreviations and logos later in this Guide. \n\nAll forms relating to a new party registration application are shown in Appendix 1. \n\nGuide for registering a party \n\nr  g s\n\n   p r\n\nd  \n\nPage 6 \n\n71\n\n\n--- Page 72 ---\n\nRegister of Political Parties \n\nThe AEC maintains the Register. The Register of Political Parties published on the AEC website \ncontains a list of the registered names of all federally registered political parties and the party \ndetails.  \n\nThe party details include: \n\n▪ \n\n▪ \n\n▪ \n\n▪ \n\n▪ \n\n▪ \n\n▪ \n\n▪ \n\nthe party’s name \n\nthe party’s registered abbreviation (if any) \n\nthe party’s registered logo (if any) \n\nif the party is a Parliamentary party  \n\nif the party is a non-Parliamentary party \n\nthe name and address of the registered officer \n\nthe name(s) of the deputy registered officer(s) (if any) \n\nthe party’s correspondence address, and  \n\n▪  whether the party chooses to receive election funding.  \n\nIt is the responsibility of any registered political party to ensure the information in the Register is \nup to date and accurate. \n\nGuide for registering a party \n\nr  g s\n\n   p r\n\nd  \n\nPage 7 \n\n72\n\n\n--- Page 73 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 74 ---\n\nParty name selection \n\nLimitations in choice \n\nSection 129 of the Electoral Act provides that an application will be refused if the party name (or \nits abbreviation): \n\n▪\n\n▪\n\n▪\n\n▪\n\n▪\n\nis more than six words long\n\nis obscene, frivolous or vexatious1\n\nis the same as, or is likely to be confused with, or mistaken for, the name of a\n‘recognised political party’2, unless that other party is a ‘related party’3\n\nsuggests a relationship or connection with a registered political party if that connection or\nrelationship does not in fact exist\n\nuses the words ‘Independent Party’, or the word ‘Independent’ along with the name, or\nabbreviation or acronym of the name, of a recognised political party, or in a way that is\nlikely to be confused with the name, abbreviation or acronym of a recognised political\nparty.\n\nThe AEC does not reserve names for potential future applicants. \n\nNames to be registered with consent \n\nA party’s name and proposed abbreviation will be refused if: \n\n▪\n\n▪\n\nit contains a word that is in the registered name or abbreviation of a registered political\nparty; and\nthe party’s application for registration is not accompanied by written consent from the\nregistered officer of that previously registered political party to the applicant party.\n\nIf there is more than one registered political party with the word in its registered name or \nabbreviation, the written consent needs only to be from the party who was first to register the \nrelevant name or abbreviation. \n\nThe consenting party must be the party with the longest continuous registration \nof that name or abbreviation.  \n\nIn the situation where a federal branch and a related federally-registered State or Territory \nbranch register a name on the same day, only the registered officer of the federal branch can \nprovide consent to another party using that word. \n\nThe need for consent does not apply to a function word, a collective noun for people, the word \n“country”, the name of a country or recognised geographical place in Australia, or the word \n\n1 The terms ‘frivolous’ and ‘vexatious’ are to be given their ordinary meanings, and are intended to include party \nnames or abbreviations that are nonsensical or are malicious in their application. This would include, for example, an \napplicant seeking to register ‘Australian Electoral Commission’, or ‘Australian Government’ as a political party. \n\n2 For this part of the Electoral Act, recognised political party means a Commonwealth Parliamentary party, a federally \nregistered political party, or a party that is recognised or registered in a State or Territory and has endorsed a \ncandidate in its current name in that State of Territory in the previous 5 years (subsection 129(2) of the Electoral Act). \n\n3 A political party is related to another political party if it is part of the same party, for example, one is a branch or \ndivision of the other. \n\nGuide for registering a party \n\nr  g s\n\n   p r\n\nd  \n\nPage 9 \n\n74\n\n\n--- Page 75 ---\n\n“democratic”. The intention is to ensure registered political parties are sufficiently distinct in \nname, while also providing appropriate exceptions for non-key words. \n\nRead Party registration guidance to understand section 129 of the Electoral Act \nand the constraints on the name and abbreviation of a political party that may \nprevent it from being registered.  \n\nThe intention of section 129 is to prevent the registration of party names and abbreviations that \nrisk causing voter confusion with existing registered names and abbreviations.  \n\nRegistered abbreviation \n\nA party may register an abbreviation of its name, which is a shortened version or an acronym of \nits full party name. The abbreviation or acronym cannot be a separate or alternate name for the \nparty. A registered abbreviation is simply a shorter version of the party name which can be \nprinted on the ballot papers instead of the full party name. \n\nWhen choosing the name and abbreviation in the initial application for party registration, the \nparty should consider the ways in which it might want its party name to appear on ballot papers. \nThe registered officer or deputy registered officer can select whether the party name or \nabbreviation will appear near endorsed candidates’ names on the ballot papers for the Senate \nand House of Representatives.  \n\nSimilarity to names of currently registered parties  \n\nThe most contentious party names are those that may be too similar to the name of an already \nregistered or recognised party. \n\n▪  Similarity to names, abbreviations or logos of currently registered parties \n\n Party logo selection \n\nLimitations in choice \n\nSection 129A of the Electoral Act provides that registration of a logo may be refused if it: \n\n▪ \n\n▪ \n\nis obscene \n\nis the same as, or is likely to be confused with, or mistaken for, the logo of another person4\n\n▪  suggests a relationship or connection with a registered political party if that connection or \n\nrelationship does not in fact exist \n\n▪  uses the words ‘Independent Party’, or the word ‘Independent’ and the name of a \n\nrecognised political party, or abbreviation or acronym of that name, or in a way that is likely \nto be confused with the name, abbreviation or acronym of a recognised political party. \n\n4 ‘Person’ covers a wider range than just political parties, and so includes the logos of other organisations including \ncompanies, unincorporated associations and Government  bodies. \n\nGuide for registering a party \n\nr  g s\n\n   p r\n\nd  \n\nPage 10 \n\n75\n\n\n--- Page 76 ---\n\nThe inclusion of a logo in an application is optional. The refusal of a logo does not \nfail the registration of a political party.  \n\nLogos to be registered with consent \n\nA party’s proposed logo will be refused if: \n\n▪ \n\n▪ \n\nit contains a word that is in the registered name or abbreviation of a registered political \nparty; and  \nthe party’s application for registration is not accompanied by written consent from the \nregistered officer of that previously registered political party to the applicant party.  \n\nThe intention is to minimise the risk that a voter might be confused or potentially misled in the \nexercise of their choice at an election due to a political party having a registered logo similar to \nthe registered name or abbreviation of another registered political party. \n\nRead ‘Names to be registered with consent’ (above), section 129 and section 134A of \nthe Electoral Act to understand the constraints on the name, abbreviation and logo of a \npolitical party.  \n\nFormat and submission of logo \n\nA party’s logo must meet the following requirements as set out in the Commonwealth Electoral \n(Logo Requirements) Determination 2016: \n\n▪  be a vector graphic in electronic format \n\n▪  be 100% black in a CMYK (Cyan‑Magenta‑Yellow‑Black) colour space \n\n▪  be contained within a frame of 10 mm by 10 mm \n\n▪  be able to be reproduced correctly within a frame of 7 mm by 7 mm \n\n▪  not include these features: \n\no \n\no \n\nlive text \n\ntransparency or overprinting \n\no  custom halftone, transfer curve or colour profile settings \n\n▪  be a PDF file, of less than 5 megabytes, that complies with International Standard ISO \n\n32000-1:2008 as was in force on 22 March 2016. \n\nThe logo must be emailed to the AEC at: fad@aec.gov.au (the email cannot exceed 30 megabytes). \n\nSize of logos on ballot papers \n\nWhen applying for a logo it should be noted that the maximum size for a logo as it appears on \nthe ballot paper is 10 mm by 10 mm: \n\nSample logo (10 mm by 10 mm) \n\nA logo must also be able to be reproduced correctly within a frame of 7 mm by 7 mm: \n\nSample logo (7 mm by 7 mm) \n\nGuide for registering a party \n\nr  g s\n\n   p r\n\nd  \n\nPage 11 \n\n76\n\n\n--- Page 77 ---\n\nDevelop a party constitution \n\nSections 4 and 123 of the Electoral Act define an eligible political party as an organisation with \nan object or activity of promoting the election of its endorsed candidates to  the Senate and/or \nHouse of Representatives. An eligible political party must be established on the basis of a \nwritten constitution which sets out the aims of the party, and the party must meet the \nmembership criterion. The membership criterion is at least one member who is a Senator, or a \nMember of the House of Representatives of the Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia, \nor at least 1,500 members who are on the Electoral Roll. \n\nTo qualify for registration under the Electoral Act, a political party must have, and \nlodge as part of its application, a written constitution that establishes it as an \norganisation - section 123. \n\nWhile the Electoral Act is not specific about all the matters which must be included in the party \nconstitution, it should include: \n\n▪\n\n▪\n\n▪\n\n▪\n\n▪\n\n▪\n\n▪\n\n▪\n\nthe name of the party\n\nthe aims of the party, which must include that the party intends to stand candidates for\nSenate and/or House of Representatives elections (must be included in the constitution\nsubmitted to the AEC for a new political party application)\n\nthe structure and office bearers of the party, including provisions for electing or\nappointing those office bearers and describing the duties of the office bearers. These\nprovisions should include details about the administration of the party and the handling\nof the party’s assets such as money\n\ndetailed provisions for obtaining and retaining membership of the party\n\nthe requirements for holding annual general meetings or committee meetings and their\nconduct\n\nthe means by which the party constitution can be amended\n\nprovisions governing State, Territory or local branches if the party is to comprise a\nbranch structure\n\nprovisions for winding up the party and apportioning its assets.\n\nThe Electoral Act does not require a political party to be incorporated or registered as an \nunincorporated association. Some new parties have advised the AEC, however, that they have \nbeen unable to open party bank accounts to receive membership fees or party post office boxes \nwithout evidence that the party is a formal entity. \n\nThe AEC does not maintain a library of political party constitutions. \n\nGuide for registering a party \n\nr  g s\n\n   p r\n\nd  \n\nPage 12 \n\n77\n\n\n--- Page 78 ---\n\nOffice bearers \n\nParties seeking registration need to appoint the office bearers listed below. Office bearers must \nbe selected in accordance with the terms of the party’s constitution. \n\nSecretary \n\nThe Electoral Act requires a party to have an office bearer responsible for the day to day \nmanagement of the party. In section 123 of the Electoral Act, the position is defined as: \n\n▪  secretary, in relation to a political party, means the person who holds the office (however \n\ndescribed) the duties of which involve responsibility for the carrying out of the \nadministration, and for the conduct of the correspondence, of the party. \n\nUnder section 126(1) of the Electoral Act, the secretary is required to be one of the signatories \nto an application for registration by a non-Parliamentary party. \n\nAs the manager of day to day duties, the AEC expects the secretary to be the office bearer who \nis the party’s contact for general election and enrolment matters, appointments of party officials \nor to notify updates to the contact details for the party or its office bearers. \n\nWhen the AEC is writing to parties about election and enrolment matters in general, it normally \nwrites to the secretary. An Appoint Party Secretary form should be completed and lodged with a \nparty’s application for registration. \n\nRegistered officer \n\nThe registered officer is the party office bearer empowered to: \n\n▪  nominate the party’s endorsed candidates  \n\n▪  select either the party’s registered name or the party’s registered abbreviation or \nlogo to be printed on ballot papers adjacent to the party’s endorsed candidates.  \n\nSection 140 of the Electoral Act requires the AEC to send any formal notices about party \nregistration, including reviews of a party’s continued eligibility to remain registered, to the party’s \nregistered officer. \n\nThe name of each party’s registered officer is recorded in the Register of Political Parties, and \ntherefore the appointment of a registered officer is part of the application for registration. The \nElectoral Act requires the registered officer must provide a street address that will be published \non the AEC website. However, they are not required to give their residential address; the street \naddress of the party’s office is sufficient. A post office box is not permitted for this purpose by \nsection 123 of the Electoral Act. \n\nThe registered officer of a party may appoint deputy registered officers to assist in the \nnomination process. To appoint a deputy registered officer the registered officer should \ncomplete an Appoint Deputy Registered Officer form. The registered officer can also revoke the \nappointments of their deputies. \n\nSection 126(2B) of the Electoral Act provides that a person cannot hold the position of \nregistered officer and/or deputy registered officer for more than one political party.

The appointment of an agent must meet the following conditions: \n\n(a)  the person appointed is at least 18 years old \n\n(b)  written notice of the appointment is given to the Electoral Commission \n\n(c)  the name, full street address and suburb or locality of the person appointed are set out \n\nin the notice \n\n(d)  the person appointed: \n\ni. \n\nii. \n\nhas signed a form of consent to the appointment; and \n\nhas signed a declaration that he or she is eligible for appointment.  \n\nA party agent must not have been convicted of an offence against the funding and disclosure \nprovisions of the Electoral Act. \n\nParty agents have significant financial obligations under the Electoral Act in relation to lodging \nfinancial disclosures and compliance. A breach of these obligations may be subject to civil penalties. \nInformation regarding the responsibilities of a party agent can be found in the Financial Disclosure \nGuide for Political Parties available on the AEC’s website. \n\nElection funding is paid through the party agent. If no current party agent is appointed, no election \nfunding can be paid or claimed even if some of the party’s endorsed candidates meet the four per cent \nformal first preference threshold.  \n\nAn Appoint Party Agent form should be completed and lodged with the party’s registration application. \n\nParty membership \n\nThe Electoral Act provides for two types of political parties which may be registered. \n\nParliamentary parties \n\nParliamentary parties are political parties which have at least one member who is also a Senator \nor a Member of the House of Representatives. While a Parliamentary party must be an \norganisation, it does not need to provide the AEC a membership list to attain registration. \nOne member who is also a Senator or a Member of the House of Representatives (and not a \nmember of any other political party) qualifies the party against the membership criterion. \n\nIf a new political party is seeking registration as a Parliamentary party, it needs to lodge a \ndeclaration signed by a Senator or Member of the House of Representatives, on their \nparliamentary letterhead, stating that they are a member of the party and not a member of any \nother registered political party.  \n\nGuide for registering a party \n\nr  g s\n\n   p r\n\nd  \n\nPage 14 \n\n79\n\n\n--- Page 80 ---\n\nNon-Parliamentary parties \n\nMost new political parties seeking registration are non-Parliamentary parties and need to prove \nthat they have at least 1,500 members who are on the Electoral Roll. \n\nThe party needs to lodge a membership list of between 1,500 and 1,650 members as part of its \napplication. The membership list needs to contain each member’s full name, residential address \nand date of birth as it appears on the Electoral Roll. To allow the processing of a party’s \napplication to proceed quickly, email and telephone contacts should be included for each \nmember. Failure to provide comprehensive contact details for members may delay processing \nthe application. \n\nParty members used to support the application must be listed on the Electoral Roll. The party \ncan check the enrolment of each member in the membership list by using the check my \nelectoral enrolment facility on the AEC website. The Electoral Roll can also be viewed in \nelectronic form at AEC offices. \n\nIt can save a party several weeks in delays if the party does its own check of its \nmembers’ electoral enrolment online or at an AEC office. \n\nThe AEC requires a party to choose a maximum of 1,650 members for the membership list \nincluded with their application. The AEC will return a membership list in excess of 1,650 \nmembers and ask the party to lodge the membership list with between 1,500 and 1,650 \nmembers.  \n\nAppendix 2 details the membership testing process. \n\nThe Electoral Act does not require the party to charge its members a membership fee. This \ndecision is left to the discretion of the party. \n\nCompleting the application \n\nApplication form \n\nTo register a party, an Application for registration of a Parliamentary party or an Application for \nregistration of a non-Parliamentary party form (as appropriate) should be completed.

The letter will also advise of the process of applying for \nregistration and potential time frames and next steps. \n\nInitial assessment \n\nThe AEC will examine the application against all the requirements of the Electoral Act. That is, \nthe AEC will test for evidence that: \n\n▪ \n\nthe party is an organisation, established on the basis of a written constitution that sets \nout the aims of the party, including that the party intends to promote the election to the \nSenate and/or House of Representatives of candidates endorsed by it \n\n▪ \n\nthe name of the party and any abbreviation sought are not prohibited \n\n▪  any logo sought is not prohibited and has been provided in a format that conforms to \n\ntechnical requirements as set out in the Commonwealth Electoral (Logo Requirements) \nDetermination 2016. \n\n▪ \n\nthe application is made by the secretary of the party or a current Senator or Member of \nthe House of Representatives in the Parliament of the Commonwealth for a \nParliamentary party, or in the case of a non-Parliamentary party the secretary, and a \nfurther nine members \n\n▪ \n\nthe application form is complete with all the details and the attachments required under \nthe Electoral Act, including office bearer appointments \n\n▪  at least 1,500 of the members provided to support the party’s registration can be found \n\non the Electoral Roll. \n\nIf there are apparent problems with an application that might require the AEC \nto refuse it when the initial assessment is complete, section 131 of the \nElectoral Act provides for the Electoral Commission to issue a formal notice to \nthe party, giving it an opportunity to vary the application. \n\nThe party can vary the application so that the AEC is able to proceed with advertising it, or \nrequest that the Electoral Commission determine the application in its current form. If the \napplication is not amended, it is likely the Electoral Commission will refuse to register the party. \n\nIf the application passes its initial assessment, the AEC will advertise the party’s application as \nrequired by section 132 of the Electoral Act. \n\nPublication Australia-wide \n\nWhen the Electoral Commission is satisfied that the party’s application is in order, it must \nadvertise the application in accordance with section 132 of the Electoral Act on the AEC website \nand in newspapers circulating generally in each State and Territory. The advertisement will give \nany person or organisation an opportunity to object to the registration of the party.  \n\nObjections are considered only on the following grounds: \n\nGuide for registering a party \n\nr  g s\n\n   p r\n\nd  \n\nPage 17 \n\n82\n\n\n--- Page 83 ---\n\n▪\n\n▪\n\n▪\n\n▪\n\nthat the application does not relate to an eligible political party (as defined in sections 4\nand 123 of the Electoral Act)\nthat the application does not accord with all the requirements set out under the Electoral\nAct (as outlined in section 126 of the Electoral Act)\nthat the name or abbreviation of the party is prohibited under section 129 of the Electoral\nAct\nthat the logo is prohibited under section 129A of the Electoral Act.\n\nThe advertisement provides a period of one month in which any person or organisation can \nlodge an objection. If an objection meets the grounds set out above, the AEC will forward it to \nthe proposed registered officer of the party so that the party can respond to the objection, should \nthey choose to do so. Redacted copies of the objection and any response from the applicant \nparty are made available on the AEC website.  \n\nFinal determination – decision and Statement of Reasons \n\nThe application, any objections lodged and any response to those objections from the party are \nthen put to a delegate of the Electoral Commission who will make a final determination on the \napplication. The AEC will advise the registered officer of the party of the final decision and \nprovide a copy of a Statement of Reasons for the decision. The Statement of Reasons is also \npublished on the AEC website. The Electoral Act provides appeal rights in relation to party \nregistration decisions. See “Appeals” later in this Guide. \n\nIf the party has been registered, the AEC will provide the registered officer with a copy of the \nparty’s entry in the Register and relevant information for newly registered political parties. The \nAEC will also update the copy of the Register on the AEC website to include the new party. \n\nHow long will the process take? \n\nThe minimum timeframe to process an application for party registration is three months.  \n\nThe stages of assessment being: \n\nInitial Assessment \n\nexpected to take a minimum of five weeks \n\nDelegate consideration and advertising \n\nexpected to take a minimum of two weeks \n\nPublic consideration period \n\na minimum of one month* \n\nFinal assessment \n\na minimum of one week** \n\n*Timeframe prescribed under section 132 of the Electoral Act.\n**Should written particulars be received objecting to an application, the final assessment\ntimeframe is expected to be longer than one week.\n\nNo action during an election \n\nSection 127 of the Electoral Act provides that “no action shall be taken in relation to any \napplication for the registration of a political party” in the period commencing on the day of the \nissue of a writ for a federal election and finishing on the day of the return of that writ. That \nmeans that the processing of applications is suspended on the issue of a writ for a federal \nelection (including a by-election) and can recommence only after that writ is returned. \n\nGuide for registering a party \n\nr  g s\n\n   p r\n\nd  \n\nPage 18 \n\n83\n\n\n--- Page 84 ---\n\nSection 127 of the Electoral Act provides that the AEC shall take no action in \nrelation to an application for registration, during the period commencing on the \nday of the issue of a writ for a federal election and finishing on the day of the \nreturn of that writ. \n\nRegistered State or Territory branches \n\nSection 130 of the Electoral Act provides that the Electoral Commission may \nregister an eligible political party that is related to a political party. \n\nOften a political party may establish branches or divisions in one or more states or territories \nand want to separately register those branches or divisions. Registration of a branch would \nfollow the same process as applying to register a party outlined in this Guide. The application to \nregister a branch includes that it must be established in accordance with a written constitution, \nhave at least 1,500 members (non-Parliamentary), appoint office bearers and use the \nappropriate form: \n\n▪  Application for registration of a Parliamentary party, or  \n\n▪  Application for registration of a non-Parliamentary party. \n\nRecognised State or Territory branches \n\nAn alternative to the registration of a branch is applying for branch recognition. A registered \npolitical party may approach the AEC to request that it recognise a State or Territory branch. \n\nIn determining whether to recognise a State or Territory branch, the AEC relies on the definition \nof State branch in Part XX of the Electoral Act.  \n\nSection 287(1) of the Electoral Act defines a State branch, in relation to a political \nparty, means a branch or division of the party that is organised on the basis of a \nparticular State or Territory. \n\nThe AEC must be satisfied that the branch or division is organised on the basis of a particular \nState or Territory. The type of evidence the AEC would consider when making a determination \nwould include: \n\n▪  details of the establishment of the branch including the inaugural meeting minutes \n▪  details of the current office bearers and their most recent appointment or election \n▪  a copy of the constitution of the branch \n▪  details of the activities of the branch, its website, the way it services the members in that \n\n▪ \n\nState or Territory \nthe level of ongoing financial activity along with copies of statements from the branch’s \nbank accounts \n\n▪  any further evidence that might show that the branch should be recognised, such as \n\nregistration with the electoral commission in that State or Territory, or other evidence of \nthe membership of the branch. \n\nIf the AEC formally recognises a State or Territory branch of a registered political party, the \nbranch is required to appoint a secretary and party agent. The party agent is required to lodge \nfinancial disclosure returns for the recognised branch. \n\nGuide for registering a party \n\nr  g s\n\n   p r\n\nd  \n\nPage 19 \n\n84\n\n\n--- Page 85 ---\n\nThe recognised branch is entitled to have access to Electoral Roll data. \n\nSection 90B of the Electoral Act governs the provision of information on the \nElectoral Roll for the State or Territory in which a recognised branch of a political \nparty is organised. \n\nObligations of registered political parties \n\nFinancial disclosure obligation under the Electoral Act \n\nThe AEC provides publications designed to assist political parties with financial disclosure \nobligations under the Electoral Act.  \n\nThe Financial Disclosure Guide for Political Parties assists political parties to understand their \nfinancial disclosure obligations under the provisions of Part XX of the Electoral Act.  \n\nPolitical parties registered with the AEC and their state or territory branches are required to \nlodge an annual Political Party Disclosure Return by 20 October each year. \n\nFor the purposes of disclosure, organised state or territory branches of registered political \nparties are treated as being separate to the registered party and must complete their own \nannual return form. \n\nRecognised branches \n\nWhere a registered political party has State or Territory branches which are separately \nrecognised by the AEC, these State or Territory branches must lodge a separate annual \nfinancial disclosure return covering the operation of the party in their State or Territory. \n\nDate for public inspection of annual returns \n\nAnnual returns are made available for public inspection on the first working day of February \neach year. \n\nReturns can be seen on the Transparency Register on the AEC website. \n\nElection funding \n\nAfter each federal election or by-election, the AEC distributes money to eligible political parties, \ncandidates and Senate groups to reimburse them for electoral expenditure. Payment of election \nfunding is included in Division 3 of Part XX of the Electoral Act. \n\nThe AEC publishes on its website the Election Funding Guide which is intended to assist eligible \npolitical parties, candidates and Senate groups to access election funding. It does not address \nthe whole of the Electoral Act. Users should familiarise themselves with the relevant part of the \nElectoral Act and seek independent legal advice where necessary. \n\nThe Electoral Act and all guides published by the AEC are available at www.aec.gov.au. \n\nGuide for registering a party \n\nr  g s\n\n   p r\n\nd  \n\nPage 20 \n\n85\n\n\n--- Page 86 ---\n\nAppeals \n\nSection 141 of the Electoral Act provides for the review of certain decisions of the Electoral \nCommission, or of a delegate of the Electoral Commission. \n\nSection 141(2) provides that where a delegate of the Electoral Commission makes a reviewable \ndecision, a person affected by the decision, who is dissatisfied with the decision may, within the \nperiod of 28 days after the day on which the decision first comes to the notice of the person, or \nwithin such further period as the Electoral Commission (being the three Commissioners of the \nAEC) allows, make a written application to the Electoral Commission to have the decision \nreviewed. \n\nA reviewable decision means a decision of the Electoral Commission, or of a delegate of the \nElectoral Commission: \n\n▪\n▪\n▪\n▪\n▪\n▪\n▪\n\n▪\n▪\n\nto register a political party; or\nto refuse an application for the registration of a political party; or\nto enter a logo of a political party in the Register of Political Parties; or\nto refuse to enter a logo of a political party in the Register of Political Parties; or\nto grant an application under section 134(1) to change the Register of Political Parties; or\nto refuse an application under section 134; or\nto uphold an objection under section 134A(1) relating to the continued use of a name by\na political party; or\nto refuse to uphold an objection under section 134A(1); or\nto deregister a political party under section 137(6).\n\nAn application for review must include the person’s name, street address and the reasons why \nthe decision should be overturned. \n\nSection 141(5) of the Electoral Act provides that an application may be made to the \nAdministrative Appeals Tribunal (the Tribunal) for review of a reviewable decision made by the \nElectoral Commission or a decision under section 141(2) or section 141(4). An application to the \nTribunal can be made under the provisions of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975. \nFurther information is available on the Tribunal’s website at www.aat.gov.au. \n\nWhen the Electoral Commission makes a reviewable decision, it must advise all interested \nparties of their review rights as set out above. \n\nGuide for registering a party \n\nr  g s\n\n   p r\n\nd  \n\nPage 21 \n\n86\n\n\n--- Page 87 ---\n\nAppendix 1 - Forms relating to a new party registration \n\nThe following forms are available on the AEC website at www.aec.gov.au. \n\nFor the registration of a new party: \n\n▪ Application for registration of a non-Parliamentary party [PDF 111KB] | [RTF 1.1MB]\n▪ Application for registration of a Parliamentary party [PDF 110KB] | [RTF 1.1MB]\n▪ Appoint Party Secretary [PDF 95KB] | [RTF 986KB]\n▪ Secretary's statutory declaration [PDF 79KB] | [RTF 234KB]\n▪ Sample membership spreadsheet [XLS 34KB]\n▪ Appoint Party Agent [PDF 92KB] | [RTF 418KB]\n▪\n\nLodging a written submission under s.131 (3) – non-Parliamentary party [PDF\n94KB] | [RTF 638KB]\nLodging a written submission under s.131 (3) – Parliamentary party [PDF 94KB] | [RTF\n638KB]\n\n▪\n\nSee the AEC website for further information about maintaining the registration \nof a party. \n\nGuide for registering a party \n\nr  g s\n\n   p r\n\nd  \n\nPage 22 \n\n87\n\n\n--- Page 88 ---\n\nAppendix 2 - Membership testing \n\nMembership testing process \n\nWhen a membership list is submitted to the AEC to support either registration or a review, the \nfollowing steps are taken: \n\n1. The membership list is checked to confirm that it contains between 1,500 and 1,650 names.\n\n2. The membership list is checked against the Electoral Roll through an automated process.\n\nParty members will fall into the following three categories: matched to one; matched to many;\nor no match.\n\n3. The names in the categories ‘matched to many’ and ‘no match’ are individually checked\n\nagainst the Electoral Roll. These members now fall into one of four categories: matched to\nthe Electoral Roll; deceased; not currently enrolled to vote; or not found on the roll.\n\n4. Unique members – Two or more parties cannot rely on the same members for the purpose\n\nof registration or continued registration. The names of party members matched to the\nElectoral Roll in both stages of testing are then compared to membership lists of other\nregistered political parties to identify any cross-party duplicates. Duplicates are removed from\nthe membership list.\n\n5. Less than 1,500 – If after this verification process the membership list does not contain 1,500\n\nnames, the party will be issued with a Notice to vary or review  it’s application.\n\n6. 1,500 or more – If after this verification process is completed, the membership list contains\nbetween 1,500 and 1,650 names of electors, the second phase of testing commences.\n\n7. Random testing – The membership list is now randomised using an excel function. The size\nof the random sample is determined by the number of members on the list after steps 2 to 4\nare completed.\n\n8. Party members are contacted starting from the top of the randomised list. In the first instance\nemails are sent to those members with an email address. If no response is received after 24-\n48 hours the member will be contacted via phone.\n\n9. Contact is attempted on three separate occasions. If after the third attempt the member is still\nuncontactable they are deemed a non-response (not a denial) and the next consecutive\nperson on the list is contacted. Phone contact is continued in this way until the required\nnumber of contacts is reached.\n\nGuide for registering a party \n\nr  g s\n\n   p r\n\nd  \n\nPage 23 \n\n88\n\n\n--- Page 89 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 90 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 91 ---\n\nAgenda item 2: For decision: Membership testing process and approach \n\nIn response to recent amendments to the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 (the Electoral \nAct) by the Electoral Legislation Amendment (Party Registration Integrity) Act 2021 (the \nParty Registration Act), the Commission discussed proposed sample sizes for registered \nnon-Parliamentary political party membership list testing as outlined in the paper entitled \n‘Party registration – ABS advice for membership testing lists for 'at least 1,500 members'.    \n\nThe proposed methodology, which examined sample sizes derived from data provided by \nthe ABS, is based on the current method with updated sample sizes. \n\nThe Commission endorsed the methodology of the proposed approach but requested \nadditional statistical advice from the ABS regarding the percentage chances of incorrectly \nrejecting or accepting membership lists. \n\nCommission decision: \n\n• Agree that ABS staff will recalibrate the parameters in the data provided to the\nCommission to ensure a reasonable (low) probability of rejecting a valid list or\naccepting an invalid list. The Commission will examine the re-worked parameters out-\nof-session.\n\n• Agree that the Commission endorses the current general approach, noting that the\n\nmethodology is an extension of the existing methodology.\n\nAgenda item 3: For decision: Manner and timing of non-parliamentary political party \nregister review \n\nIn response to the recent amendments to the Electoral Act by the Party Registration Act, the \nCommission examined administrative processes for the AEC to ensure registered non-\nParliamentary parties meet new membership eligibility requirements within the three-month \nperiod provided by the Party Registration Act.  The Commission endorsed a review of the \nregistered non-Parliamentary parties under section 138A of the Electoral Act, with \nsubsequent action to be taken under section s137 of the Electoral Act if appropriate. \n\nDecision: \n\n• Agree that the Commission will, for the purpose of reviewing the Register, provide a\n\nnotice under s 138A of the Electoral Act to each registered non-Parliamentary party to\nrequest specified information to establish that the party meets the 1,500 membership\neligibility requirement as at 2 December 2021.\n\nAgenda item 4: Closing \n\nThe Chair thanked members for attending and closed the meeting at 5:10pm. \n\nMinutes: Australian Electoral Commission Meeting No. 274 \n\nPage 2 \n\n91\n\n\n--- Page 92 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 93 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 94 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 95 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 96 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 97 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 98 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 99 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 100 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 101 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 102 ---\n\n102\n\n\n--- Page 103 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 104 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 105 ---\n\nLeader \nFlux Australia\n\n105s 47F - Personal Privacy\n\n\n--- Page 106 ---\n\ns 4F (Personal Privacy)\n\n\n--- Page 107 ---\n\ns 4F (Personal Privacy)\n\n\n--- Page 108 ---\n\ns 4F (Personal Privacy)\n\n\n--- Page 109 ---\n\ns 4F (Personal Privacy)\n\n\n--- Page 110 ---\n\ns 4F (Personal Privacy)\n\n\n--- Page 111 ---\n\ns 4F (Personal Privacy)\n\n\n--- Page 112 ---\n\ns 4F (Personal Privacy)\n\n\n--- Page 113 ---\n\ns 4F (Personal Privacy)\n\n\n--- Page 114 ---\n\ns 4F (Personal Privacy)\n\n\n--- Page 115 ---\n\ns 4F (Personal Privacy)\n\n\n--- Page 116 ---\n\ns 4F (Personal Privacy)\n\n\n--- Page 117 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 118 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 119 ---\n\n119\n\n\n--- Page 120 ---\n\nDocument No 18\n\nVOTEFLUX.ORG | Upgrade Democracy!\n\n13th February 2022\n\nTo:\nJoanne Reid\nAssistant Commissioner\nDisclosure, Assurance and Engagement\nAustralian Electoral Commision\n\nRe: Notice under s 137(1)(b) of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 (Electoral Act) –\nIntention to Deregister – VOTEFLUX.ORG | Upgrade Democracy!\n\nDear Ms Reid,\n\nIn your January 13 correspondence, you said:\n> I am notifying you under s 137(1)(b) of the Electoral Act that the Electoral Commission is\nconsidering deregistering the Party, as the Electoral Commission is satisfied on reasonable\ngrounds that the Party does not have at least 1,500 members.\n\nI speak on behalf of the Party. We do not believe that such a decision would be based on\nreasonable grounds. This is because the AEC’s methodology is flawed. Below, we will detail\nwhy we believe that this is the case and provide reasoning and evidence to back this up.\n\nWe have 3 arguments supporting our case. Each argument is individually sufficient to show\nthat a decision (by the AEC) to deregister the Party would not be based on reasonable\ngrounds; each argument is a decisive criticism of the current methodology.\n\n● The statistical method used fails ~10% of the time for borderline cases.\n● The statistical method uses an artificially limited sample size and thus does not\n\nestimate party membership, though does (roughly) measure membership attrition.\n● We have sufficient membership and provide evidence. Attached is a list of 4680\nmembers. Each entry was, at some point, verified against the electoral roll.\n\nUnless each of these criticisms can be addressed, we do not believe that a decision by the\nAEC to deregister the Party would be based in reality.\n\nThe AEC’s membership test methodology fails 10% of the time in borderline cases\n\nOur understanding of the AEC’s method is to sample the membership provided and use this\nas a basis for statistical analysis that provides an answer to whether the Party meets\nmembership requirements. That is: given a list of members (\ntrials,\n) and\nestimate the ratio of which are valid members. Although this is (presumably) done without\nreplacement, given that\nenough for a “sniff test”).\n\n, we can estimate the distribution as binomial (this is good\n\n1500 ≤ 𝑁 ≤ 1650\n\n𝑛 ≪ 𝑁\n\n𝑁\n\n𝑁\n\n𝑛\n\n120s 47F - Personal Privacy\n\n\n--- Page 121 ---\n\nAssume that a party submits a list of 1650 members, and exactly 1500 of these claimed\nmembers still consider themselves to be members. That is, the true probability of a random\nmember confirming their membership is P(success) = 1500/1650 = 0.909; i.e., P(failure) =\n(the failure rate). Given\n0.0909. Let us consider the binomial distribution with\n𝑃(𝑥 < 𝑋)\n𝑛 = 53,  𝑥 = 7\n(That is: how likely is it that 7 less than the number of observed failures, ?)𝑋\n\n(x is the maximum number of failures) what is the probability that\n\n𝑝 = 0. 0909\n\n?\n\nIn this case,\nNote: this can be verified quickly in excel with the formula:\n\n𝑃(7 < 𝑋) = 10. 5%\n\n.\n\n=1 - BINOM.DIST.RANGE(53, 0.0909, 0, 7)\n\nSo, if exactly 1500 of 1650 were valid, the AEC would make an incorrect determination (i.e.,\none that is in conflict with reality) 10.5% of the time.\n\nIn your previous correspondence you said:\n> [...] the Electoral Commission is satisfied on reasonable grounds [...]\n\nDoes the AEC believe that a false negative rate of 10.5% is acceptable and constitutes\n“reasonable grounds”? We do not.\n\nThe AEC’s membership test methodology artificially reduces sample size\n\nLet us consider whether there are more than 1500 cars, owned by residents, in Sydney.\nAssume that Sydney has a residential population of 5,000,000 and the probability of a\nresident owning a car is 91% (the expected failure rate is 0.09). All residents own 0 or 1\ncars.\n\nUsing the AEC’s membership testing methodology as a template, we can estimate the\nnumber of cars in Sydney via this method: first, select 1650 residents. Conduct 53 trials. If\nthere are more than 7 failures, then there are less than 1500 cars owned by residents in\nSydney. In this hypothetical case, there were 9 failures.\n\nI trust that you can plainly see that this methodology is flawed. It is flawed because it is\nartificially reducing the sample size without accounting for the full population. The same error\nis being made by the AEC when evaluating party validity on the basis of membership testing.\n\nWhat sort of error correction could we do here to actually estimate the number of cars in\nSydney? Here is one rudimentary method: by inspection we can see that a binomial\ndistribution with approximately twice the failure rate (0.17) has mean of 9 – i.e., if the failure\nrate were 0.17 then we would expect 9 of 53 trials to fail (with a std. dev. of 2.74). If the true\nfailure rate was 0.17 (i.e., 83% of residents own a car), then we can guess that there are\n\n0. 83 · (5 · 10\n\n6\n6\n)  = 4. 15 · 10\n\ncars; a bit over 4 million.\n\nKeep in mind that – given this experimental setup – we’d expect 9 or more failures 10% of\nthe time. If we were doing this experiment in real life, 10% of the time we would\nunderestimate the number of cars by a factor of more than 2500x. (Of course, this large\n\n121\n\n\n--- Page 122 ---\n\nbecause the population of Sydney is large – the exact factor isn’t important; the fact that we\nunderestimated by an unquantifiable degree is, though, and indicates flawed methodology.)\n\nWe trust that the connection to the current matter is obvious. Artificially reducing the sample\nsize, and then treating this sample size as the population size, will lead to significant errors.\n\nReturning to specifics of the matter at hand: if we correct for the AEC’s artificial reduction in\nsample size using the rudimentary method above, based on the Party’s claimed membership\ncount (4,680), then it would be expected that the Party has a verifiable membership count of\n3,884 members. This exceeds the requirements in s 137(1)(b) of the Electoral Act. Even if\nthis were an overestimation by a factor of 2x, the Party would still meet the requirements of\nthe Act.\n\nThus, we reject any decision to deregister the party – based on the procedures that the AEC\nhas undertaken to date – on the grounds that it is in conflict with reality.\n\nBonus: a decisively superior methodology at no additional cost\n\nWe note that the AEC could, at very little cost (time, energy, expense, etc), dramatically\nincrease the confidence of their membership testing by accepting lists of more than 1650\nmembers and following this procedure:\n\n1. Automatically match all possible members against the electoral roll (as is already\n\ndone). The cost of automatically matching names against the electoral roll is constant\nregardless of the input size (because it is done by computer). If less than 1650\nnames are automatically matched, proceed to manual verification (as is done\ncurrently) and stop at 1650. Note that this will only ever save the AEC time and\nmoney. It is economically rational to do this.\n\n2. Where more than 1650 members can be automatically matched, record this number.\n3. Select 1650 names from that list and conduct 53 trials. use the failure rate to\n\nestimate the probability of a member being valid.\n\n4. Use this probability, combined with the length of the list in step (2) to estimate the\n\nvalid membership population of the party being tested.\n\n5. Calculate error measurements and confidence intervals, etc. (Or evaluate against\n\npredetermined thresholds.)\n\n6. Determine eligibility.\n\nThis method is profitable for the AEC – i.e., the AEC would save money using this procedure\nover the current procedure. Additionally, parties that are true negatives will still be true\nnegatives at no additional cost. Incidence of false negatives, however, will be greatly\nreduced.\n\nFinally, we have sufficient membership and attach proof\n\nPlease find attached a list of 4,680 members of the Party. Note that these are the subset of\nmembers for whom we have been able to pre-validate their electoral roll details at some\npoint.\n\n122\n\n\n--- Page 123 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 124 ---\n\ns 4F (Personal Privacy)\n\n\n--- Page 125 ---\n\ns 4F (Personal Privacy)\n\n\n--- Page 126 ---\n\ns 4F (Personal Privacy)\n\n\n--- Page 127 ---\n\ns 4F (Personal Privacy)\n\n\n--- Page 128 ---\n\ns 4F (Personal Privacy)\n\n\n--- Page 129 ---\n\ns 4F (Personal Privacy)\n\n\n--- Page 130 ---\n\ns 4F (Personal Privacy)\n\n\n--- Page 131 ---\n\ns 4F (Personal Privacy)\n\n\n--- Page 132 ---\n\ns 4F (Personal Privacy)\n\n\n--- Page 133 ---\n\ns 4F (Personal Privacy)\n\n\n--- Page 134 ---\n\ns 4F (Personal Privacy)\n\n\n--- Page 135 ---\n\ns 4F (Personal Privacy)\n\n\n--- Page 136 ---\n\ns 4F (Personal Privacy)\n\n\n--- Page 137 ---\n\ns 4F (Personal Privacy)\n\n\n--- Page 138 ---\n\ns 4F (Personal Privacy)\n\n\n--- Page 139 ---\n\ns 4F (Personal Privacy)\n\n\n--- Page 140 ---\n\ns 4F (Personal Privacy)\n\n\n--- Page 141 ---\n\ns 4F (Personal Privacy)\n\n\n--- Page 142 ---\n\ns 4F (Personal Privacy)\n\n\n--- Page 143 ---\n\ns 4F (Personal Privacy)\n\n\n--- Page 144 ---\n\ns 4F (Personal Privacy)\n\n\n--- Page 145 ---\n\ns 4F (Personal Privacy)\n\n\n--- Page 146 ---\n\ns 4F (Personal Privacy)\n\n\n--- Page 147 ---\n\ns 4F (Personal Privacy)\n\n\n--- Page 148 ---\n\ns 4F (Personal Privacy)\n\n\n--- Page 149 ---\n\ns 4F (Personal Privacy)\n\n\n--- Page 150 ---\n\ns 4F (Personal Privacy)\n\n\n--- Page 151 ---\n\ns 4F (Personal Privacy)\n\n\n--- Page 152 ---\n\ns 4F (Personal Privacy)\n\n\n--- Page 153 ---\n\ns 4F (Personal Privacy)\n\n\n--- Page 154 ---\n\ns 4F (Personal Privacy)\n\n\n--- Page 155 ---\n\nDocument No 19\n\nFrom:\nTo:\nCc:\nSubject:\nDate:\nAttachments:\n\nHi \n\nFAD\n\nRE: Delegate consideration - s 137 response received - VOTEFLUX.ORG | Upgrade Democracy!

VOTEFLUX.ORG | Upgrade Democracy! (the Party) did\nrespond to the s 138A notice, however they did not pass membership testing. It is up to the delegate\nto consider the response within the legislative framework and determine if the Party should be\nderegistered. Attached is the relevant legal advice. Can you please let me know if you support this\nprior to sending to the delegate.\nRegards,\n\nGood morning Joanne\n\nOn 13 February 2022, the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) received the attached statement\n(also accessible at OBJECT ID: A1369037) from the Registered Officer of VOTEFLUX.ORG | Upgrade\nDemocracy! (the Party), \nJanuary 2022 (attached, also accessible at OBJECT ID: A1386429).

All registered non-Parliamentary parties, including the Party, had until 2 December 2021 to\ncomply with the legislative requirement to have ‘at least 1,500 members’.\n\nOn 8 October 2021, the Registered Officer of the Party was issued with a notice under s 138A(3) of\nthe Electoral Act (the 138A Notice), requesting the Party provide evidence of compliance with the\nincreased membership requirements and submit a membership list of between 1,500 and 1,650\nmembers by 8 December 2021 (see OBJECT ID: A1157688).\n\n156s 47F (Personal Privacy)s 47F (Personal Privacy)s 47F (Personal Privacy)s 47F (Personal Privacy)s 47F (Personal Ps 47F (Person s 47F - Personal Privacy s 47F - Personal Privacy s 47F (Personal Privacy)\n\n\n--- Page 157 ---\n\nOn 26 November 2021, the AEC sent a reminder to the Party (see OBJECT ID: A1304513).\n\nOn 7 December 2021, the Party responded to the s 138A Notice providing the requested\ndocumentation (OBJECT ID: A1267776). Membership testing was conducted in accordance with the\nmembership testing methodology and formula provided by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS).\n\nA breakdown of the membership testing outcome is at OBJECT ID: A1303995. See below table for a\nsummary of the membership contact outcomes.\n\nThe relevant numbers for this membership test were:\nThe random sample size\nMaximum number of denials permitted\nContact attempts made*\nResponses received\n\nConfirmed Membership\nDenied Membership\n\nPASS/FAIL\n\nMembers\n53\n7\n78\n\n44\n9\nFAIL\n\nOn 13 January 2022, the Party was issued with a notice under s 137(1) of the Electoral Act (the s 137\nNotice), stating that the Electoral Commission is considering deregistering the Party as the Electoral\nCommission is satisfied on reasonable grounds that the Party does not have at least 1,500 members\n(OBJECT ID: A1386429). Pursuant to s 137(2) of the Electoral Act, the Party was provided with one\nmonth to respond to the s 137 Notice (being 13 February 2022).\n\nOn 13 February 2022, the Registered Officer of the Party provided a response to the s 137 Notice\n(OBJECT ID: A1369037) and on 14 February 2022 the Party \nthe Additional Statement (OBJECT ID: A1386415). The Party’s email of 13 February 2022 also included\na membership list in support of the statement which contains 4,680 names (OBJECT ID: A1369039).\n\n, Secretary and DRO) provided\n\nEligibility Provisions\nPursuant to s 138A(1) of the Electoral Act, the Electoral Commission may review the Register to\ndetermine whether a party remains an ‘eligible political party’, or whether it should be deregistered\nunder ss 136 or 137 of the Electoral Act. Under s 123(1) of the Electoral Act an ‘eligible political party’\nmeans a political party that:\n\na.  either:\n\n(i)                  is a Parliamentary party; or\n(ii)                has at least 1,500 members; and\n\nb.  is established on the basis of a written constitution (however described) that sets out the\n\naims of the party.\n\nA ‘Parliamentary party’ means a political party at least one member of which is a member of the\nParliament of the Commonwealth. The Party does not have, and has never had, a member of the\nParliament of the Commonwealth. Section 136 of the Electoral Act pertains to a party failing to\nendorse candidates and therefore is not relevant to this review.\n\nThe issue in question is whether the statement provide by the Party is sufficient for you, as a\ndelegate, to be assured that the Party has ‘at least 1,500 members’. Section 137(1)(b) of the Electoral\nAct first requires the delegate of the Electoral Commission to be ‘satisfied on reasonable grounds’\nthat the Party does not have at least 1,500 members.\n\nLegislative framework\n\n157s 47F (Personal Privacy\n\n\n--- Page 158 ---\n\nSection 138A(1) of the Electoral Act outlines the purpose of a s 138A review:\n\nThe Electoral Commission may review the Register to determine whether one or more of the\n\nparties included in the Register:\n\n(a) is an eligible political party; or\n(b) should be deregistered under section 136 or 137.\n\nSections 138A(3 – 5) of the Electoral Act states:\n\n3.  For the purposes of reviewing the Register, the Electoral Commission may give a\nwritten notice to the registered officer of a registered political party requesting\nspecified information on the party’s eligibility to be registered under this Part.\n\n4.  The notice must specify a period within which the information must be provided. The\n\nperiod must be at least 2 months.\n\n5.  The registered officer must comply with the notice within the specified period.\n\nHowever, the Electoral Commission may extend that period.\n\nSection 137(1)(b) of the Electoral Act prescribes that the Electoral Commission is satisfied on\nreasonable grounds that the Party does not have ‘at least 1,500 members’ and therefore does not\nmeet the requirement of being an eligible political party under s 123 of the Electoral Act to remain in\nthe Register of Political Parties (the Register). The Electoral Commission must give the registered\nofficer of the party notice, in writing, that it is considering deregistering the party under this section,\nsetting out its reasons for considering doing so and the terms of the provisions of subsections (2), (3),\n(4) and (5).\n\nSubsections 137(2 – 5) of the Electoral Act includes:\n\n2.  of the Electoral Act prescribes that where a notice is given under subsection (1) in relation to a\npolitical party, the registered officer of the party or 10 members of the party may, within 1\nmonth after the date on which the notice was given, lodge with the Electoral Commission a\nstatement, in writing, signed by the registered officer or by those members of the party, as the\ncase may be, setting out reasons why the party should not be deregistered under this section.\n\n3.  Where a statement lodged under subsection (2) is signed by 10 members of a political party,\n\nthe statement shall set out the names and addresses of those members and contain a\nstatement that they are members of that party.\n\n4.  Where a notice is given under subsection (1) in relation to a political party and a statement is\nnot lodged under subsection (2) in response to that notice, the Electoral Commission shall\nderegister the party.\n\n5.  Where, in response to a notice given under subsection (1) in relation to a political party, a\nstatement is lodged under subsection (2), the Electoral Commission shall consider that\nstatement and determine whether the political party should be deregistered for the reason set\nout in that notice.\n\nLegal advice\n\n158s 42 (LPP)s 42 (LPP)\n\n\n--- Page 159 ---\n\nFurther Legal advice\n\nMembership testing methodology\nUnder the membership testing methodology and formula provided by the ABS it is the Electoral\nCommission’s view that, absent of any relevant factors to the contrary, a failure to satisfy the test\nprovided by the ABS alone constitutes reasonable grounds upon which the delegate of the Electoral\nCommission, can be satisfied that a political party does not have at least 1,500 members.\n\nConsideration of the Statement\nUnder s 137(5) of the Electoral Act, the Electoral Commission shall consider the statement lodged\nunder s 137(2) of the Electoral Act. However, s 137(5) of the Electoral Act stipulates that the Electoral\nCommission shall consider that statement and determine whether the political party should be\nderegistered for the reason set out in that notice. The reasons set out in the s 137 Notice issued to the\nParty was for failing to have at least 1,500 members in response to the s 138A Notice (s 137(1)(b) of\nthe Electoral Act). \n\nUnder s 137(6) of the Electoral Act, where the Electoral Commission determines that a political party\nshould be deregistered, it shall:\nderegister the party; and\ngive the last person who was registered officer of the party written notice of the deregistration,\nsetting out its reasons for rejecting the reasons set out in the statement.\n\nUnder s 137(6A) of the Electoral Act, if the Electoral Commission deregisters a party the Electoral\nCommissioner:\n\nmust publish a notice of the deregistration on the AEC website; and\nmay publish the notice in any other way that the Electoral Commissioner considers appropriate\n(under AEC policy a statement of reasons is published setting out the particulars of the\nderegistration and the basis for rejecting the reasons).\n\n159s 42 (LPP)s 42 (LPP)s 42 (LPP)\n\n\n--- Page 160 ---\n\nAs the delegate of the Electoral Commission the statement for your consideration is at OBJECT ID:\nA1369035, as well as the Additional Statement at OBJECT ID: A1386415. A summary of that statement\ncan be provided by PEPRS if required. The membership list lodged with the Party’s statement contains\n4,680 names (OBJECT ID: A1369039).\n\nDelegate’s decision\nThe response received by the AEC from the Party in relation to the s 137 Notice issued meets the\nlegislative requirements of s 137(2) of the Electoral Act because it:\n\nwas received within 1 month after the date on which the notice was given;\nIs in writing;\nIs made by the Registered Officer of the Party; and\nOutlines reasons why the Party should not be deregistered.\n\nAs per s 137(5) of the Electoral Act, you, as a delegate of the Electoral Commission, shall consider that\nstatement and determine whether the political party should be deregistered for the reason set out in\nthat notice. In this case, the reason is for failing to have at least 1,500 members (s 137(1)(b) of the\nElectoral Act).\n\nOnce you have considered the Party’s response please advise, by return email, if you believe that\nVOTEFLUX.ORG | Upgrade Democracy! should be deregistered under s 137(1)(b) of the Electoral Act.\nIn your reply email can you please provide statements as to why you made your decision? These\nstatements will form part of a Statement of Reasons if the party is to be deregistered.

With a small sample size and poor quality list it’s just not how you would set up\nand perform a statistical test.\n\n(As a simple example, if the first 150 you checked were invalid you’d need to find one more\namong the remaining 1500 to definitely reject with 100 % certainty. At the same time if the first\n1499 were members you still need one more of the remaining 151 to 100% accept. Through\nrandomised sampling probability theory controls the risks and optimises (minimises) the\nrequired sample size for those controls. If there are systematic patterns in the lists and it is not\nrandomised it is more or less impossible to be very accurate about the decision probabilities of a\ntest.)\n\nHope this helps.\n\nBest regards,\n\nAnders\n\nFrom: \nSent: Friday, 29 July 2022 2:18 PM\nTo: Anders Holmberg \nCc: \nSubject: AEC party sampling methodology - summary of meeting of 21 July 2022 (LEX1984)\n[SEC=OFFICIAL]\n\nCAUTION: External email. Do not click links or open attachments unless you\nrecognise the sender and know the content is safe.\n\nDear Anders\n\n and I last week on Thursday 21 July. At that meeting we\n\nThank you for meeting with \ndiscussed the ABS methodology for sampling and testing membership of political parties used by\nthe AEC. You kindly reviewed some questions we had and considered some issues raised by\napplications for review of the decision to deregister VoteFlux.Org | Upgrade Democracy! (the\nParty). The purpose of this email is to summarise the key points raised in that discussion. I would\nbe grateful if you could confirm that I have set out your advice correctly. If not, I would be\ngrateful if you could edit the response or reply clarify any points.\n\n167s 4F (Personal Privacy)s 4F (Personal Privacy)s 4F (Personal Privacy)s 4F (Personal Privacy)s 4F (Personal Privacy)s 4F (Personal Privacy)s 47F (Personal Pr\n\n\n--- Page 168 ---\n\nIf possible, we would be grateful for your response by Monday 1 July 2022. We may provide this\ninformation to the Electoral Commission for the purposes of their review of the decision to\nderegister the Party.\n\n1. What conclusions can be drawn in relation to the list of 4680 names in the Party’s list,\nfollowing the delegate’s decision to test the top 1,650 names of that list (the sub-list)?\n\nWith respect to the test conducted it is not the randomisation or not that is causing the false\nrejection (or false acceptance) rate to land outside the limits. It is the sample size that control\nthe test conditions. If you had randomised you would have been able to say something about the\nwhole list as the final sample (probabilistically) would have referred to the 4680 not just the\n1650. Nevertheless you still would have needed a bigger sample size to get the desired risk rates.\n\nYou advised that as the Party’s list was not randomised before the sub-list was made (as only the\ntop 1650 names were selected) it is not possible to draw any meaningful statistical conclusions\nabout the Party’s whole list of 4680 from the results of testing the sub-list. You can only say\nsomething about the selected 1650. This is because, without randomisation there is no chance of\nthe other records being selected. You explained this by the analogy of attempting to sample\nfrom a deck of cards for aces. Having failed to first shuffle the deck, chunking the bottom half\naway, and then sample from what is left will not give you useful information about all original\ncards. Those thrown away were never in the running.\n\nThe test done indicates a list with low proportion of eligible members among the 1650.\n\nDELETE As would usually be the case, as the test of the sub-list failed, it is possible to conclude\n(to the level of confidence to which the test is set) that the sub-list of 1,650 did not include 1,500\nmembers.\n\n2. What are the alternative options for testing the larger list?\n\nYou explained that a larger sample size would be required to test a large list to the same degree\nof confidence. Current sampling is calibrated so that the probability of accepting an invalid list is\nless than 2%, and the probability of falsely rejecting a valid list is less than 6%. You estimated that\nthe sample size required to test the full list of 4680 names would be over 300. You also advised\nthat excel spreadsheet calculator provided to the AEC could provide information about the\nsample size required to test a list of 4680 names to different levels of confidence.\n\nWe have now used the calculator (attached), to calculate that sampling a list of 4680 members,\nwhere the desired probability of false rejection is 6% and the desired probability of false\nacceptance is 2%, would require an approximate sample size of 564 and a maximum number of\ndenials allowed of 399.   \n\n3. Does filtering names affect the error rates?\n\nYou explained that in your view, the arguments made in Mr Kaye’s paper with respect to filtering\nnames increasing the error rate are without foundation. You explained that, provided the\n\n168\n\n\n--- Page 169 ---\n\nfiltering process is done in accordance with the ABS methodology, filtering names works in\nfavour of parties by removing from a list members who would not have been capable of meeting\nthe requirements.\n\nCorrect this would improve the ‘quality’ of the list and decrease the occurrence of finding denials\n(non-members) in the list sample.\n\n4. Your general comments on Max Kaye’s paper\n\nYou considered that it was not instructive to consider in depth Mr Kaye’s hypothetical example.\nThat example started from the premise that the party has more than 1,500 and sought to prove\nthat a specific list could be rejected by the sampling methodology.\n\nYou agreed with the general proposition that if the correct sampling size was not adopted in\nrelation to a larger list, the likelihood of false rejection increased. This is shown by the calculator.\n\nWe also discussed generally the rationale for requiring a smaller sampling size as a practical and\nfair method for testing party lists. We discussed the difficulties of testing a larger list.  Since the\nrequirement is minimum 1500 a party with a very large list that is ‘low quality’ in the sense that\nit contains a high percentage of non-members will require a very big sample size to control false\nrejection risks. This relates to the incentives of parties to keep good records of their members\nand provide the AEC with a high quality list. Providing large low quality lists should be\ndiscouraged.\n\nSenior Government Lawyer\n\nLegal Services Section | Legal & Procurement Branch\nAustralian Electoral Commission\n\nDISCLAIMER:\n\nIf you have received this transmission in error please notify us immediately by return email\nand delete all copies.
