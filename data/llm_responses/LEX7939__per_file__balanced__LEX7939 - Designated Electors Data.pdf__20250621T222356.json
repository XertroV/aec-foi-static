It references that this data, showing numbers per federal electoral event since 2019, is available on the AEC's Compliance & Enforcement Activities webpage, aligning with the FOI overview's note that this information is available elsewhere.\n*   **New Declarations of Designated Electors (Request 2):**\n    *   **FY2022/23:** 37 new declarations.\n    *   **FY2023/24:** 1 new declaration.\n    *   **FY2024/25 (to date):** 211 new declarations.\n    This data directly addresses the FOI request and highlights the notable increase in declarations for FY2024/25, as mentioned in the FOI overview.\n*   **Authority of Declarations (Request 2a):** All declarations reported in response to item (2) were made by a delegate of the Electoral Commissioner, confirming this aspect of the FOI overview.\n*   **Internal Review Applications (Request 3):**\n    *   **FY2022/23:** 4 unique applications for internal review.\n    *   **FY2023/24:** 0 unique applications.\n    *   **FY2024/25 (to date):** 4 unique applications.\n    This data directly addresses the request for review numbers.\n*   **Outcomes of Internal Review Decisions (Request 4):**\n    *   **FY2022/23:** All 4 applications resulted in confirmed decisions.\n    *   **FY2023/24:** Not applicable (no applications).\n    *   **FY2024/25 (to date):** 3 applications resulted in confirmed decisions, and 1 was set aside.\n    This information confirms the FOI overview's statement that decisions were predominantly confirmed, with one being set aside in FY2024/25.\n*   **Administrative Review Tribunal Applications (Request 4 - subsequent):** No applications for review to the Administrative Review Tribunal were recorded for FY2024/25 to date, consistent with the FOI overview.\n*   **Declarations Ceasing Effect (Request 5):** No declarations ceased to have effect by virtue of s 202AH(3) for financial years 2022/23, 2023/24, or 2024/25 to date, aligning with the FOI overview.\n\nIn summary, the document provides specific statistical data largely corresponding to the details outlined in the FOI request's overview, particularly concerning new declarations, review processes, and the authority of declarations, while also indicating where other requested data (total numbers) can be found."

FYI the overview of the FOI request is: FOI request LEX7939 sought statistical data from the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) on \"designated electors,\" including their overall numbers, new declarations, and associated review processes.

The request also revealed a small number of internal review applications (four in FY2022/23 and four in FY2024/25), predominantly resulting in confirmed decisions, though one was set aside in FY2024/25. No applications for review to the Administrative Review Tribunal or instances of declarations ceasing effect under s 202AH(3) were recorded for the specified periods.\n\nDocument Text:\n\nLEX7939  \n\nFOI Request LEX7939 â€“ Designated Electors Data  \n\nI seek access to the following, as at the close of rolls 7 April 2025: \n\n1.
