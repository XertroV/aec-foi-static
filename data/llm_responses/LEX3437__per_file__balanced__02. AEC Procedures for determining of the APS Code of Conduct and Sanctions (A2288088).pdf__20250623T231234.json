            "text": "### Summary of Document: \"AEC Procedures for Determining Breaches of the APS Code of Conduct and Sanctions\" (December 2018)\n\nThis document outlines the formal procedures for the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) to investigate suspected breaches of the Australian Public Service (APS) Code of Conduct by its employees and to impose appropriate sanctions. It details the steps involved, including the identification of a suspected breach, the appointment of a 'breach decision maker' and 'sanction delegate' (who must be independent and unbiased), and the process for conducting an investigation.\n\nThe procedures emphasize the principles of procedural fairness, requiring that employees be informed of the details of any suspected breach and potential sanctions, and be given a reasonable opportunity to respond. It also covers the imposition of sanctions, which are intended to be proportionate to the breach, and mandates the recording of all determinations and sanctions. The document clarifies how these procedures apply if an employee's engagement status changes or if they move to another agency during an investigation.\n\n### Relevance to FOI Request No. LEX3437\n\nThis document is highly relevant to FOI Request No. LEX3437, which sought \"AEC policies governing staff adherence to APS Values, Employment Principles, and Code of Conduct.\" Specifically, this document directly addresses the \"Code of Conduct\" aspect of the request by providing the AEC's formal policy and procedural framework for managing, investigating, and determining breaches of the APS Code of Conduct and applying sanctions. It details the mechanisms in place to ensure staff adherence and accountability regarding the Code."

The Electoral Commissioner is an \n\"Agency Head\" for the purposes of the Act (paragraph 29(2)(b) of the \nCommonwealth Electoral Act 1918). \n\nApplication \n1. Application of the Procedures \n1.1  The Procedures apply in determining whether an APS employee, has breached the Code in \n\nsection 13 of the Act.  \n\n1.2    In these Procedures, unless the contrary intention appears, a reference to: \n\na)  an APS employee includes reference to a former APS employee who is suspected of \n\nhaving breached the Code while an employee in the AEC; and  \n\nb)  a breach of the Code by a person includes a reference to a person engaging in conduct \n\nset out in subsection 15(2A) of the Act in connection with their engagement as an APS \n\nemployee. \n\n1.3. In accordance with subsection 15(7) of the Act, these procedures are publicly available on the \n\nAEC’s website. \n\nNote:   The Procedures apply only in relation to a suspected breach of the Code by an APS employee \n\nin respect of which a determination is to be made. Not all suspected breaches of the Code \nmay need to be dealt with by way of a determination. In particular circumstances, another \nway of dealing with a suspected breach of the Code may be more appropriate. \n\nThese Procedures are not legislative instruments (see subsection 15(8) of the Act).  \n\n2\n\n\n--- Page 4 ---\n\nPrinciples   \n2       Who may determine a breach of the Code and impose a sanction \nNote: \n\n Clause 40 of the Australian Public Service Commissioner’s Directions 2016 provides that where the \nconduct of an APS employee raises concerns that relate both to effective performance and possible \nbreaches of the Code, the Agency Head must, before making a decision to deal with a suspected \nbreach under the formal misconduct provisions (being these Procedures), have regard to any relevant \nstandards and guidance issued by the Australian Public Service Commissioner.  \n\nInvestigations of suspected misconduct by former employees can be undertaken, but sanctions cannot \nbe imposed on former employees. \n\n2.1 \n\nAs soon as practicable after a suspected breach of the Code has been identified, the \nElectoral Commissioner or the Deputy Electoral Commissioner may deal with a suspected \nbreach, in accordance with the Procedures, by: \n\na)  making a written determination whether the APS employee has breached the Code; or \n\nb)  selecting the person  to make a determination whether the APS employee has breached \n\nthe Code (the breach decision maker).  \n\nNote: \n\nThe Australian Public Service Commissioner’s prior written consent is required if a non APS \nemployee will be selected as the breach decision maker / sanction delegate (subsection 78(8) \nof the Act).  \n\nAn internal or external investigator may be appointed by the breach decision maker to \ninvestigate the alleged breach, gather evidence and present a report of factual findings, \nincluding recommendations.  \n\nThe person making the decision on the sanction must hold a delegation under the Act to do \nso (the sanction delegate). \n\nNote: These Procedures do not prevent the breach decision maker from being the sanction decision \nmaker in the same matter. \n\nSubject to clause 2.3 above, these procedures do not prevent the breach decision maker \nfrom being the sanction delegate in the same matter. \n\nThe Australian Public Service Commission publication ‘Handling Misconduct Managers Guide \n’, is a recommended resource available to the Breach Decision Maker and Sanction Delegate, \nto support them in making the determination and sanction decision.  \n\nDetermination process \nThe process for determining whether an APS employee has breached the Code must be \ncarried out with as little formality, and with as much expedition, as a proper consideration of \nthe matter allows. \n\nThe process must be consistent with the principles of procedural fairness. \n\nA formal hearing is not required in order for a person to determine whether an APS \nemployee has breached the Code. \n\nInformation to be given to employee before a determination is made \nA determination may not be made in relation to a suspected breach of the Code by an APS \nemployee unless reasonable steps have been taken to inform the employee of: \n\n2.2 \n\n2.3 \n\n2.4 \n\n2.5 \n\n3 \n3.1 \n\n3.2 \n\n3.3 \n\n4 \n4.1 \n\n3\n\n\n--- Page 5 ---\n\na)  the details of the suspected breach of the Code including any variation of those details; \n\nand \n\nb)  the sanctions that may be imposed on the employee under subsection 15(1) of the Act. \n\n4.2 \n\nA person who is making a determination in relation to a suspected breach of the Code by an \nAPS employee must give that employee a reasonable opportunity to make an oral and/or \nwritten statement, in relation to the suspected breach.  This statement may be made to the \nBreach Decision Maker or to the appointed investigator: \n\na)  within seven days of the APS employee being informed of the details (or any variation of \n\nthose details) of the suspected breach; or \n\nb)  such longer period as is allowed.  \n\n4.3 \n\n4.4 \n\n5 \n\n5.1 \n\n5.2 \n\n6 \n6.1 \n\n6.2 \n\n6.3 \n\n6.4 \n\nAn APS employee who does not make a statement in relation to the suspected breach is not, \nonly for that reason, to be taken to have admitted committing the suspected breach. \n\nThe breach decision maker or the investigator may agree to a request made by the APS \nemployee who is suspected of breaching the Code to have a support person present in a \nmeeting or interview they conduct.  The support person cannot speak or advocate on the \nemployees behalf. \n\nPersons involved in making a determination or imposing a sanction to be \nindependent and unbiased \nThe breach decision maker, any investigator assisting the breach decision maker and the \nsanction delegate must be, and must appear to be, independent and unbiased. \n\nA person must not determine whether an APS employee has breached the Code if the \nperson has previously made a report in relation to all or any matter suspected of \nconstituting the breach by the employee. \n\nSanctions \nIf a determination is made that an APS employee has breached the Code, the APS employee \nmay be subject to the imposition of a sanction under section 15 of the Act. \n\nSanctions are intended to be proportionate to the nature of the breach, and provide a clear \nmessage to the relevant employee that their behaviour was unacceptable. \n\nThe process for deciding on sanction must be consistent with the principles of procedural \nfairness. \n\nIf a determination is made that an APS employee has breached the Code, a sanction may not \nbe imposed on the employee unless reasonable steps have been taken to: \n\na) \n\ninform the APS employee of: \n\ni. \n\nii. \n\niii. \n\nthe determination that has been made; \n\nthe sanction or sanctions that are under consideration; and \n\nthe factors that are under consideration in determining any sanction to be \n\nimposed; and \n\n4\n\n\n--- Page 6 ---\n\nb)  give the APS employee a reasonable opportunity to make a written statement in relation \n\nto the sanction or sanctions under consideration within 7 calendar days, or any longer \n\nperiod that is allowed by the sanction delegate. \n\nNote:   The sanction delegate may decide to give the employee the opportunity to make both a \n\nwritten and an oral statement. \n\n7 \n7.1 \n\nRecord of determination and sanction \nIf a determination is made in relation to a suspected breach of the Code by an APS \nemployee, a written record must be made of: \n\na)  the suspected breach; and  \n\nb)  the determination; and  \n\nc)  any sanctions imposed as a result of a determination that the employee breached the \n\nCode; and \n\nd)  if a statement of reasons was given to the employee – the statement of reasons.  \n\nNote:   The Archives Act 1983 and the Privacy Act 1988 apply to a record made under this clause. \n\n8 \n8.1 \n\nProcedures where basis of engagement in the AEC changes or ends \nThis clause applies where an APS employee is suspected of having breached the Code and a \ndetermination has not been made in relation to the suspected breach before: \n\na)  the basis of the employee's engagement in the AEC changes; or \n\nb)  the employee moves to another Agency, \n\nNote:   Examples of a change in the basis of an APS employee's engagement in an Agency are as follows: \n\na)  a change from engagement for a specified term, or for the duration of a specified task, to \n\nengagement as an ongoing APS employee; \n\nb)  a change from engagement for duties that are irregular or intermittent to engagement as an \n\nongoing APS employee. \n\n8.2 \n\nIf the basis of the APS employee's engagement in the AEC has changed before a \ndetermination is made in relation to the suspected breach, the determination must be made \nin accordance with the procedures applicable to the basis of the employee's engagement in \nthe AEC at the time the process for determining whether the employee has breached the \nCode is commenced. \n\n8.3 \n\nMovements (including promotions) will not take effect until the matter is resolved, unless \nboth Agency Heads agree otherwise. \n\nNote: The matter is taken to be resolved when: \n\na)  a determination is made; or \n\nb) \n\nit is decided that a determination is not necessary. \n\nLegislation \n\n■  Archives Act 1983 (Cth), < http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Series/C2004A02796 > \n\n■  Privacy Act 1988 (Cth), < http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Series/C2004A03712 > \n\n5\n\n\n--- Page 7 ---\n\n■  Public Service Act 1999 (Cth), < http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Series/C2004A00538 > \n\n■  Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Act 2013 (Cth), \n\n< http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Series/C2013A00123 > \n\n■  Public Governance, Performance and Accountability (Consequential and Transitional \n\nProvisions) Act 2014 (Cth), < http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Series/C2014A00062 > \n\nReferences \n\n•  Australian Public Service Commission publication ‘Handling Misconduct: a human resource \n\nmanagers guide’ \n\nContact  \nPeople, Performance and Integrity team, \nCorporate Services Branch \n\n6\n\n\n--- Page 8 ---\n\nVersion Control \n\nVersion \n\nLast review date \n\nAction \n\nNext review date \n\nOwner \n\nApproved by \n\n1.0 \n\n18/08/2014 \n\nConversion to PSB \nPolicy Format \n\n19/08/2015 \n\n1.1 \n\nDecember 2016 \n\nNovember 2017 \n\n1.2 \n\n1.3 \n\nDecember 2018 \n\nReview in line with \nBranch policy review \nfor EA 16-19 and \nPSCD16 \n\nChange references \nto PSB to reflect CSB \n– Insert unchanged \npolicy to new AEC \nPolicy template \nformat \n\nReview and changes \nto clarify procedural \nrequirements and \ninclude updates \nfrom APSC \nPublications \n\nDecember 2017 \n\nNovember 2018 \n\nPerformance \nManagement, \nPSB \n\nTom Rogers, A/g \nElectoral \nCommissioner \n\nPerformance \nand Conduct \nTeam \n\nAssistant Director, \nPerformance and \nConduct Team \n\nDirector, People \nSecurity and \nIntegrity \n\nAssistant \nCommissioner – \nCorporate Services \nBranch \n\nNovember 2019 \n\nDirector People, \nSecurity and \nIntegrity \n\nFirst Assistant \nCommissioner - \nCapability \n\n7\n\n"
