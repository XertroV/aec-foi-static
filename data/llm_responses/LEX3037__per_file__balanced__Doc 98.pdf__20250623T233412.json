            "text": "This document is the \"Electoral communications escalation scenarios\" guide, prepared by the Australian Electoral Commission's (AEC) Electoral Integrity Assurance Taskforce (EIAT) and updated by Google. It outlines eleven distinct scenarios of problematic electoral communications, ranging from unauthorised paid advertisements and misleading voter information to foreign interference, hate speech, and content that breaches platform policies but not necessarily Commonwealth law. For each scenario, it provides examples and identifies relevant Commonwealth laws (e.g., *Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918*, *Criminal Code Act 1995*, *Foreign Influence Transparency Scheme Act 2018*) or policy issues.\n\n**Relevance to FOI Request LEX3037:**\nThis document is central to FOI request LEX3037, serving as the \"Electoral Communications Escalation Scenarios\" guide explicitly mentioned in the request overview. It represents a key output of the AEC's (via its EIAT) proactive engagement with major tech companies, including Google (who updated the document), concerning electoral law compliance and the 2022 federal election. The guide establishes a shared framework and common understanding for identifying, categorising, and escalating various types of electoral misinformation, disinformation, and non-compliant content. Its existence demonstrates the direct communication channels and collaborative efforts between the AEC and these platforms to monitor and address content issues, thereby safeguarding election integrity as detailed in the FOI request."

Do not include any conversational filler or preamble.To aid you, the overview of the FOI request is: [REQUEST OVERVIEW START] An FOI request (LEX3037) revealed correspondence from early 2022 between the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) and major tech companies, including Meta, Twitter, Google, Microsoft, and TikTok, regarding compliance with electoral law and the 2022 federal election. The released documents, featuring an \"Electoral Communications Escalation Scenarios\" guide and extensive communication, detail the AEC's proactive engagement—primarily through its Electoral Integrity Assurance Taskforce—with these platforms. This collaboration focused on identifying, monitoring, and addressing electoral misinformation, disinformation, and non-compliant content through direct communication channels and content referrals, thereby safeguarding election integrity.\n [REQUEST OVERVIEW END] \n\n--- MAIN DOCUMENT TEXT START ---\n\n\n\n--- Page 1 ---\n\nOFFICIAL:Sensitive\n\nElectoral communications escalation scenarios\n\nFor all reports:\nSlides here on escalation pathways (shared with AEC previously)\n\nScenari\no\n1\n\nDescription\nPaid electoral\nadvertisement\nwithout proper\nauthorisation\n(for other unpaid\ncommunications\nsee scenario 7)\n\nExamples\nElectoral ad that is not\nauthorised or is\nauthorised by fictitious\nperson/entity.\n\nCommonwealth law\ninfringed/issues\nSection 321D\nCommonwealth Electoral\nAct 1918\nPaid electoral advertising\nmust be authorised to allow\nvoters to know who is\ncommunicating the ad.\n\n2\n\n3\n\nElectoral\ncommunication\n(including a paid\nelectoral ad) that\ninfringes other\noffences in the\nCommonwealth\nElectoral Act\n\nElectoral communication\nmisleads voters on how\nto cast their votes, e.g.\nad incorrectly advises\nvoters a candidate has\nwithdrawn from the\nelection, or that a formal\nvote is to number just\none box.\n\nSection 329 Commonwealth\nElectoral Act 1918\nOffence to publish or\ndistribute any matter that is\nlikely to mislead or deceive\nan elector in relation to the\ncasting of a vote.\n\nElectoral\ncommunication\n(including a paid\nelectoral ad) that\nimpersonates a\nCommonwealth\nofficial, entity or\nservice\n\nElectoral communication\non social media by a\nperson/entity falsely\nrepresenting themselves\nto be a Commonwealth\nentity, official or service.\n\nPart 7.8 – Section 150.1\nFalse representations in\nrelation to a\nCommonwealth body and\ninjunction provisions in Part\n7 Regulatory Powers\n(Standard Provisions) Act\n2014\n\nPrepared by the EIAT, 29 October 2021\n\nUpdated by Google on 7 April 2022\nOFFICIAL:Sensitive\n\n1\n\nReleased under the FOI ActReleased under the FOI Acts 37(2), 47E(d)\n\n\n--- Page 2 ---\n\nOFFICIAL:Sensitive\n\n4\n\nElectoral\ncommunication\n(including a paid\nelectoral ad)\nposted by a\nforeign\nperson/entity\n\nElectoral communication\nmade by or on behalf of\nforeign person or entity\nthat is registrable under\nthe Foreign Influence\nTransparency Scheme Act\n2018 (FITS Act).\n\nForeign Influence\nTransparency Scheme Act\n2018\n\nAn intermediary for a\nforeign principal must\nregister within 14 days of\nentering a relationship with\na foreign principal or\nundertaking an activity on\nbehalf of a foreign principal.\n\nIf the communication is a\npaid ad that is\nunauthorised, please refer\nto scenario 1 for\nappropriate action.\n\nPrepared by the EIAT, 29 October 2021\n\nUpdated by Google on 7 April 2022\nOFFICIAL:Sensitive\n\n2\n\nReleased under the FOI ActReleased under the FOI Acts 37(2), 47E(d)\n\n\n--- Page 3 ---\n\nScenari\no\n\nDescription\n\nExamples\n\nCommonwealth law\ninfringed/issues\n\nOFFICIAL:Sensitive\n\nPrepared by the EIAT, 29 October 2021\n\nUpdated by Google on 7 April 2022\nOFFICIAL:Sensitive\n\n3\n\nReleased under the FOI ActReleased under the FOI Acts 37(2), 47E(d)\n\n\n--- Page 4 ---\n\nOFFICIAL:Sensitive\n\nCommonwealth law\ninfringed/issues\nPolicy:\n\nFI is likely to be a break of\nplatforms’ own terms of use\n\nOperational:\n\nDivision 92, Part 5.2\nCriminal Code Act 1995\n\nDetection and attribution can\nbe time and resource\nintensive, while\ndisinformation strategies are\ncheap and agile.\n\nScenari\no\n5\n\nDescription\nForeign\ninterference\n\nThis scenario\nnotes the\ndifference\nbetween the\nlegislated and\npolicy definitions\nof “foreign\ninterference”, and\nthe differing\napproaches taken\nby policy agencies\n(CFICC), and\noperational\nagencies/bodies\n(including the CFI\nTaskforce).\n\nExamples\nPolicy:\n\nSocial media accounts\nthat appear to:\n\n● amplify, then\n\nconsistently promote\ndivisive political\npositions designed to\nfragment the\nelectorate,\n● target specific\n\ndemographics within\nthe electorate with\nmessaging designed to\ninfluence voting\nbehaviour.\n\nOperational:\n\nTo be actionable under\ns92, FI activity must meet\nthe elements specified in\ns92, notably: 1.
