Do not include any conversational filler or preamble.To aid you, the overview of the FOI request is: [REQUEST OVERVIEW START] An FOI request sought minutes from Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) meetings held between March 2, 2021, and October 19, 2022, resulting in the release of seven sets of endorsed, edited minutes. These documents primarily detail the Commission's decisions and discussions concerning political party registration, deregistration, and name changes, alongside the evolving methodology for verifying party membership, particularly in response to legislative amendments increasing the minimum member requirement from 500 to 1,500. Key discussions included seeking Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) advice on membership testing, and specific rulings on party names (e.g., \"The New Liberals,\" \"Liberal Democratic Party\"), deregistration (e.g., \"Australian People’s Party,\" \"VOTEFLUX.ORG\"), and re-registration (e.g., \"Seniors United Party of Australia\").\n [REQUEST OVERVIEW END] \n\n--- MAIN DOCUMENT TEXT START ---\n\n\n\n--- Page 1 ---\n\nMinutes \n\nAustralian Electoral Commission \nMeeting No. 273 \n\nDate: Friday 3 September 2021  Time: 10:00am  Location: Microsoft Teams \n\nAttendees:  \nThe Hon. Justice Susan Kenny AM (Chair);  \nMr Tom Rogers (Electoral Commissioner);  \nDr David Gruen (Australian Statistician)   \n\nAction Officer: \n\n (Commission Secretariat) \n\nAgenda  \n\nItem \n\n1.  Welcome \n\n2.  Party Registration – overview of process \n\n3.  Commission paper –  \n\n4.  Closing \n\nAgenda item 1: Welcome and Commissioner’s introduction \n\nThe Chair opened the meeting at 10:00am. Mr Tom Rogers acknowledged the traditional \nowners of the land and welcomed the three-person Australian Electoral Commission (the \nCommission) members; the Hon. Justice Susan Kenny, and Dr David Gruen. \n\nsection 47F\n\n\n--- Page 2 ---\n\nAgenda item 2: For discussion: Membership testing process and approach \n\nMr Rogers provided an update on amendments to the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 \n(the Electoral Act). The amendments require a change to the membership testing \nmethodology used by the AEC. This change to the methodology due to an increase of the \nminimum number of members for a party to register as a non-parliamentary party.  \n\nMr Rogers noted that any changes will require consideration and a decision from the \nCommission. The current membership testing process was endorsed by the Commission on \n20 March 2017, and was most recently discussed by the Commission following the briefing \nby Dr David Gruen and staff from the ABS on 11 June 2021.  \n\nMr Rogers noted that it was likely that there will be 35 federally registered non-Parliamentary \nparties that will require a review, along with any further parties that may apply for \nregistration. \n\nMr Rogers referred to meeting paper 2. Commission agenda item - party registration \nmembership testing and summarised the five approaches for the consideration of the \nCommission.  \n\nThe Chair noted the significant administrative burden that Option Three may have if the AEC \nwas to email more than 1,500 people in each party. \n\nThe Chair also noted that the introduction of the Bill would indicate that there is a desire to \nmaintain a high level of scrutiny. Options Four and Five would reduce that level of scrutiny, \nand thus, would not align with the intent of the legislation. \n\nDr Gruen noted a point raised in an application for review; non-responses could theoretically \nbring the number of members relied upon for a membership list under the minimum required \nnumber to be registered as a non-parliamentary political party.  \n\nDr Gruen raised that if an external provider has the resources at hand there may not be a \ncontinued need for a sampling methodology. The Chair agreed. \n\nMr Rogers noted that there is a need to continue to uphold the security and integrity of the \nelectoral roll. Mr Rogers noted the intermediate option to investigate the possibility of utilising \nanother government department to conduct the membership testing.  \n\nMr Rogers noted that two elements to address would be cost and the capacity of the other \norganisation to undertake the testing. \n\nCommission decision:  \n\nInvestigate Option 2 from the meeting paper 2. Commission agenda item - party \nregistration membership testing before a further decision is made. \n\nMinutes: Australian Electoral Commission Meeting No. 273 \n\nPage 2\n\n\n--- Page 3 ---\n\nAgenda item 3: For information: Update on current matters before the Commission \n\nMr Rogers provided an update on current matters that are not yet ready for decision by the \nCommission. Mr Rogers noted that at this point there are three live applications for review \nunderway. All three applications are party registration decisions that have been submitted \nunder s141 of the Electoral Act. \n\nSmall Business Party \n\nThe Small Business Party (SBP) was deregistered by the delegate on 23 August 2021. The \noriginal decision was based on a failure to meet the required number of members. \n\nAn application for review was made by the Registered Officer of the party, \n\n, on 27 August 2021. \n\nNo membership list has been provided yet; the deadline for further information is 30 \nSeptember. \n\nThe Seniors United Party of Australia \n\nThe Seniors United Party of Australia (SUPA) was deregistered by the delegate on \n9 March 2021.

The Party have \nmade several requests for extra time. The current deadline for the provision of any additional \ninformation is 25 September 2021. \n\nThe party has indicated that the continued lockdown in NSW may result in further requests \nfor an extension of time.  \n\nThe party has been made aware that, as the party is currently not registered, there is a risk \nthat SUPA will not be registered when an election is called. \n\nCommission members discussed the two applications for review and decided that \ncorrespondence should be provided to SBP and SUPA, regarding the impact of the \namendments to the Electoral Act. \n\nDecision: Provide the Small Business Party and the Seniors Uniter Party of Australia \nwith awareness that the legislation will change the minimum number of members \nrequired to form a parliamentary party. \n\nMinutes: Australian Electoral Commission Meeting No. 273 \n\nPage 3 \n\nsection 47Fsection 47Fsection 47Fsection 42section 42\n\n\n--- Page 4 ---\n\nThe New Liberals \n\nMr Rogers raised that as part of the application for review, the leader of The New Liberals, \nMr Victor Kline, has requested that the Electoral Commissioner recuse themselves from the \nreview. Mr Rogers indicated that he sees no basis to recuse himself from the review, with the \nChair and Dr Gruen agreed. \n\nThe New Liberals were registered as a non-parliamentary party on 3 June 2021. Mr Andrew \nHirst of the Liberal Party of Australia lodged an application for review under s141 in regards \nto this decision. The issues raised by the application of : \n\n•  The name ‘The New Liberals’ is too similar to the name ‘Liberal Party of Australia’ \n\n(s129 (1)(d) and (da) of the Electoral Act) \n\n•  The New Liberals are not able to meet the membership requirements due to non-\n\ncontacts. (s126 (2)(ca) of the Electoral Act) \n\nThe New Liberals were advised of an application for review and provided a redacted version \nof the objection. Mr Kline submitted further material for the consideration of the commission  \n\nMr Kline has indicated publically that the party will lodge an application to change their \nname. The name change is not yet publically available on the Australian Electoral \nCommission website0 \n\nThe Commission agreed that further action should be undertaken when the name change is \npublished on the Australian Electoral Commission website. \n\nThe Commission further agreed to review the legal advice received on this issue and discuss \nat a future meeting, noting that the Commission undertake a de novo review of this matter \nunder s141 of the Electoral Act.  \n\nAgenda item 4: Closing \n\nThe Chair thanked members for attending and closed the meeting at 11:30am. \n\nMinutes: Australian Electoral Commission Meeting No. 273 \n\nPage 4\n\n"
