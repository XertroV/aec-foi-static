Deletions from the roll can occur for several reasons. Specifically, an \nenrolment can be deleted when: \n\no  existing records are merged (if there are duplicate enrolment records) \no  an elector has died \n\n•  Duplicate enrolment records occur when an elector’s name appears on the current electoral roll \nmore than once. This can occur when a State Direct, Federal Direct, or ordinary enrolment \napplication is processed without being matched to a current enrolment. The AEC investigates and \ncorrects duplicate enrolments on a fortnightly basis. \n\nPage 8 \n\nSection 22Section 22\n\n\n--- Page 75 ---\n\nOFFICIAL:SENSITIVE \n\n•  The AEC receives death notifications from a variety of sources including the registrar of Births \n\nDeaths and Marriages, electoral events, state and territory electoral authorities, Public Trustees, \nand members of the public. \n\n•  The AEC processes death notifications from Births Deaths and Marriages monthly; and receives \nnotification directly from relatives and interested parties. Notifications are matched to current and \ndeleted enrolment records (e.g. where a person has been removed from the roll by objection). \nOnce matched with a death notification, further investigation is required before re-enrolment can \noccur. This process is an important integrity measure that reduces impersonation opportunity.  \n\nPage 9 \n\nSection 22\n\n\n--- Page 76 ---\n\nOFFICIAL:SENSITIVE \n\nHigh trust data sources as inputs \n\nTalking points \n\n•  The Electoral Act provides for the AEC to obtain and use data from other government agencies to \n\nassist in reviewing and maintaining the roll. These data sources include: \n\no  Australian Bureau of Statistics \no  Services Australia \no  Australian Taxation Office \no  National Exchange of Vehicle and Driver Information System (NEVDIS) (licence holders in \n\neach state and territory) \n\no  Births, Deaths and Marriage registries (in each state and territory) \n\no  Australia Post \n\n•  Data from these sources is used to support the following roll management activities: \n\no  death deletions \n\no \n\nidentity verification \n\nPage 10 \n\nSection 22Section 22Section 22Section 22Section 22Section 22\n\n\n--- Page 77 ---\n\nOFFICIAL:SENSITIVE \n\nRoll management data sources \n\nPage 11 \n\nSection 22\n\n\n--- Page 78 ---\n\nDeath notification data \n\n•  The AEC employs a robust process to remove deceased electors from the roll and prevent \n\ndeceased persons from being added to the electoral roll. \n\n•  The AEC manages the removal of deceased electors from the roll by collecting and analysing \ninformation from a variety of sources, including advice from the elector’s family and data from \nstate registrars (Births, Deaths, and Marriages), and other electoral authorities. \n\n• \n\nIn the 12 months ending 30 June 2023, the AEC removed 145,000 deceased persons from the \nelectoral roll. \n\nPage 12 \n\nSection 22Section 22\n\n\n--- Page 79 ---\n\nPage 13 \n\nSection 22\n\n\n--- Page 80 ---\n\nOFFICIAL:SENSITIVE \n\nHuman checks and system checks \n\nTalking points \n\nHuman checks \n\nMonthly Roll Integrity Checks \n\n•  As part of the Roll Program, the AEC utilises system code to generate internal lists (from the \n\ncurrent electoral roll data) that identifies elector records with similar and or exactly matching client \ndetails. The lists are distributed to trained operators across the country. In this, operators review \nrecords on the electoral roll for applications with: \n\no  same Given Name/DOB/Address data \no  identical Elector Names and Addresses data \no  review of Electoral Twins data (‘Electoral Twins’ are different individuals with the same name \n\nand date of birth) \n\no  other potential duplicates identified for transactions processed in the last month \n•  There are genuine instances in which two separate clients have matching details. The roll \nintegrity checks identify genuine processing errors where a client’s existing record was not \nmatched correctly. \n\n•  An amendment is a transaction used to correct any error made by the AEC during enrolment \n\nprocessing. An ‘error’ can take many forms including a data entry error or incorrectly matching an \nelector. \n\n•  A Federal Direct Enrolment Update (FDEU) transaction is corrected if the AEC has information \n\nthat the transaction was wrongfully applied.  \n\nPage 14 \n\nSection 22Section 22\n\n\n--- Page 81 ---\n\nPage 15 \n\nSection 22\n\n\n--- Page 82 ---\n\nPage 16 \n\nSection 22\n\n\n--- Page 83 ---\n\nPage 17 \n\nSection 22\n\n\n--- Page 84 ---\n\nPage 18 \n\nSection 22\n\n\n--- Page 85 ---\n\nPage 19 \n\nSection 22\n\n\n--- Page 86 ---\n\nPage 20 \n\nSection 22\n\n\n--- Page 87 ---\n\nPage 21 \n\nSection 22\n\n\n--- Page 88 ---\n\nPage 22 \n\nSection 22\n\n\n--- Page 89 ---\n\nPage 23 \n\nSection 22\n\n\n--- Page 90 ---\n\nPage 24 \n\nSection 22\n\n\n--- Page 91 ---\n\nOFFICIAL:SENSITIVE \n\nJoint Standing Committee on Electoral \nMatters (JSCEM) \n\nPage 25 \n\nSection 22\n\n\n--- Page 92 ---\n\nPage 26 \n\nSection 22\n\n\n--- Page 93 ---\n\nOFFICIAL:SENSITIVE \n\nQuestions \n\nOther remarks \n\n•  On any given day we estimate that more than 7,000 people on the roll either move house or die, \n\nthereby necessitating a change in their enrolment. \n\no  These are identified through a range of mechanisms (self-initiated, death deletion, FDEU \n\netc.) but this cannot be done on the day it occurs due to varying factors. \n\no  The AEC processes on average 10,000 transactions each day to add and remove people \nfrom the roll or make changes to address and/or name and other details – the roll is highly \ncurrent and accurate. \n\nPage 27 \n\nSection 22Section 22\n\n\n--- Page 94 ---\n\nOFFICIAL:SENSITIVE \n\n•  The final safety net of roll integrity for an electoral event is the Close of Rolls period. \n\nApplications are accepted up to 8pm (local time) on the seventh day after issue of the writ. \n\n•  During the Close of Rolls period, the focus of AEC advertising is for people to enrol or check their \n\nenrolment and update their details if necessary  \n\nPage 28 \n\nSection 22\n\n\n--- Page 95 ---\n\nPage 29 \n\nSection 22\n\n\n--- Page 96 ---\n\nPage 30 \n\nSection 22\n\n\n--- Page 97 ---\n\nSenate Assurance\n\n\n--- Page 98 ---\n\nFederal Senate processing and assurance brief \n\nPage 1 \n\nSection 22\n\n\n--- Page 99 ---\n\nPage 2 \n\nSection 22\n\n\n--- Page 100 ---\n\nPage 3 \n\nSection 22\n\n\n--- Page 101 ---\n\nPage 4 \n\nSection 22\n\n\n--- Page 102 ---\n\nPage 5 \n\nSection 22\n\n\n--- Page 103 ---\n\nSection 22\n\n\n--- Page 104 ---\n\nSection 22\n\n\n--- Page 105 ---\n\nSection 22\n\n\n--- Page 106 ---\n\nSection 22\n\n\n--- Page 107 ---\n\nSection 22\n\n\n--- Page 108 ---\n\nSection 22\n\n\n--- Page 109 ---\n\nSection 22\n\n\n--- Page 110 ---\n\nSection 22\n\n\n--- Page 111 ---\n\nSection 22\n\n\n--- Page 112 ---\n\nSection 22\n\n\n\n--- Page 1 ---\n\nFrom:\nTo:\nCc:\nSubject:\nDate:\nAttachments:\n\nTom Rogers\n\n Briefing Materials [SEC=OFFICIAL:Sensitive]\n\nFW: \nMonday, 21 August 2023 11:24:48 AM\nimage004.png\n2023 08 23 - \n\n Briefing Pack.pdf\n\nMeeting papers attached, saved in diary also\n\nExecutive Leadership Team\nAustralian Electoral Commission\n\nFrom: \nSent: Monday, August 21, 2023 10:55 AM\nTo:\nSubject: FW: \nHi \nI’ve put all the documents for the \nKath would like a copy.\nRegards,\n\n,\n\n Briefing Materials [SEC=OFFICIAL:Sensitive]\n\n meeting into a PDF and it saved \n\n here if Tom and\n\nDeputy Electoral Commissioner\n\nAustralian Electoral Commission\n\nJeff Pope APM\n\nFrom: Jeff Pope <Jeff.Pope@aec.gov.au> \nSent: Friday, August 18, 2023 4:55 PM\nTo: \nSubject: FW: \nGrateful if the documents in this link can please be placed into a pdf and placed into my diary as\nmeeting papers for Wednesday.\nRegards,\nJeff Pope | Deputy Electoral Commissioner\nExecutive Leadership Team\nAustralian Electoral Commission\n\n Briefing Materials [SEC=OFFICIAL:Sensitive]\n\nFrom: Kath Gleeson <Kath.Gleeson@aec.gov.au> \nSent: Friday, August 18, 2023 4:38 PM\nTo: Tom Rogers <Tom.Rogers@aec.gov.au>;

This includes information about: \n\no  Elector Information Reports completed by polling officials to advise of corrections to the \nelectoral roll, to notify if an elector is unable to vote, or to notify that an elector has died. \n\nPage 4 \n\nSection 22Section 22Section 22Section 22\n\n\n--- Page 5 ---\n\nOFFICIAL:SENSITIVE \n\n•  Following an electoral event, updates are made to the Electoral Roll from information provided on \n\ndeclaration envelopes and Elector Information Reports. \n\nPage 5 \n\nSection 22\n\n\n--- Page 6 ---\n\nOFFICIAL:SENSITIVE \n\nHigh integrity roll program \n\nTalking points \n\nPage 6 \n\nSection 22Section 22\n\n\n--- Page 7 ---\n\nOFFICIAL:SENSITIVE \n\nPage 7 \n\nSection 22Section 22\n\n\n--- Page 8 ---\n\nOFFICIAL:SENSITIVE \n\nDeletions (duplicate, death, and eligible overseas electors) \n\n•  Removing electors from the roll to maintain accuracy and integrity is important to ensure the roll is \n\nalways up to date. Deletions from the roll can occur for several reasons. Specifically, an \nenrolment can be deleted when: \n\no  existing records are merged (if there are duplicate enrolment records) \no  an elector has died \n\n•  Duplicate enrolment records occur when an elector’s name appears on the current electoral roll \nmore than once. This can occur when a State Direct, Federal Direct, or ordinary enrolment \napplication is processed without being matched to a current enrolment. The AEC investigates and \ncorrects duplicate enrolments on a fortnightly basis. \n\nPage 8 \n\nSection 22Section 22\n\n\n--- Page 9 ---\n\nOFFICIAL:SENSITIVE \n\n•  The AEC receives death notifications from a variety of sources including the registrar of Births \n\nDeaths and Marriages, electoral events, state and territory electoral authorities, Public Trustees, \nand members of the public. \n\n•  The AEC processes death notifications from Births Deaths and Marriages monthly; and receives \nnotification directly from relatives and interested parties. Notifications are matched to current and \ndeleted enrolment records (e.g. where a person has been removed from the roll by objection). \nOnce matched with a death notification, further investigation is required before re-enrolment can \noccur. This process is an important integrity measure that reduces impersonation opportunity.  \n\nPage 9 \n\nSection 22Section 22\n\n\n--- Page 10 ---\n\nOFFICIAL:SENSITIVE \n\nHigh trust data sources as inputs \n\nTalking points \n\n•  The Electoral Act provides for the AEC to obtain and use data from other government agencies to \n\nassist in reviewing and maintaining the roll. These data sources include: \n\no  Births, Deaths and Marriage registries (in each state and territory) \n\n•  Data from these sources is used to support the following roll management activities: \n\no  death deletions \n\nPage 10 \n\nSection 22Section 22Section 22Section 22Section 22\n\n\n--- Page 11 ---\n\nOFFICIAL:SENSITIVE \n\nRoll management data sources \n\nFederal Direct Enrolment and Update (FDEU) \n\nPage 11 \n\nSection 22\n\n\n--- Page 12 ---\n\nOFFICIAL:SENSITIVE \n\nDeath notification data \n\n•  The AEC employs a robust process to remove deceased electors from the roll and prevent \n\ndeceased persons from being added to the electoral roll. \n\n•  The AEC manages the removal of deceased electors from the roll by collecting and analysing \ninformation from a variety of sources, including advice from the elector’s family and data from \nstate registrars (Births, Deaths, and Marriages), and other electoral authorities. \n\n• \n\nIn the 12 months ending 30 June 2023, the AEC removed 145,000 deceased persons from the \nelectoral roll. \n\nPage 12 \n\nSection 22Section 22\n\n\n--- Page 13 ---\n\nOFFICIAL:SENSITIVE \n\nPage 13 \n\nSection 22\n\n\n--- Page 14 ---\n\nOFFICIAL:SENSITIVE \n\nHuman checks and system checks \n\nTalking points \n\nHuman checks \n\nMonthly Roll Integrity Checks \n\n•  As part of the Roll Program, the AEC utilises system code to generate internal lists (from the \n\ncurrent electoral roll data) that identifies elector records with similar and or exactly matching client \ndetails. The lists are distributed to trained operators across the country. In this, operators review \nrecords on the electoral roll for applications with: \n\no  same Given Name/DOB/Address data \no  identical Elector Names and Addresses data \no  review of Electoral Twins data (‘Electoral Twins’ are different individuals with the same name \n\nand date of birth) \n\no  other potential duplicates identified for transactions processed in the last month \n•  There are genuine instances in which two separate clients have matching details. The roll \nintegrity checks identify genuine processing errors where a client’s existing record was not \nmatched correctly. \n\n•  An amendment is a transaction used to correct any error made by the AEC during enrolment \n\nprocessing. An ‘error’ can take many forms including a data entry error or incorrectly matching an \nelector. \n\n•  A Federal Direct Enrolment Update (FDEU) transaction is corrected if the AEC has information \n\nthat the transaction was wrongfully applied.  \n\nPage 14 \n\nSection 22Section 22\n\n\n--- Page 15 ---\n\nOFFICIAL:SENSITIVE \n\nPage 15 \n\nSection 22\n\n\n--- Page 16 ---\n\nOFFICIAL:SENSITIVE \n\nPage 16 \n\nSection 22\n\n\n--- Page 17 ---\n\nOFFICIAL:SENSITIVE \n\nPage 17 \n\nSection 22\n\n\n--- Page 18 ---\n\nOFFICIAL:SENSITIVE \n\nPage 18 \n\nSection 22\n\n\n--- Page 19 ---\n\nPage 19 \n\nSection 22\n\n\n--- Page 20 ---\n\nOFFICIAL:SENSITIVE \n\nPage 20 \n\nSection 22\n\n\n--- Page 21 ---\n\nPage 21 \n\nSection 22\n\n\n--- Page 22 ---\n\nOFFICIAL:SENSITIVE \n\nSection 22\n\n\n--- Page 23 ---\n\nOFFICIAL:SENSITIVE \n\nPage 23 \n\nSection 22\n\n\n--- Page 24 ---\n\nOFFICIAL:SENSITIVE \n\nPage 24 \n\nSection 22\n\n\n--- Page 25 ---\n\nOFFICIAL:SENSITIVE \n\nPage 25 \n\nSection 22\n\n\n--- Page 26 ---\n\nOFFICIAL:SENSITIVE \n\nPage 26 \n\nSection 22\n\n\n--- Page 27 ---\n\nOFFICIAL:SENSITIVE \n\nQuestions \n\nOther remarks \n\n•  On any given day we estimate that more than 7,000 people on the roll either move house or die, \n\nthereby necessitating a change in their enrolment. \n\no  These are identified through a range of mechanisms (self-initiated, death deletion, FDEU \n\netc.) but this cannot be done on the day it occurs due to varying factors. \n\no  The AEC processes on average 10,000 transactions each day to add and remove people \nfrom the roll or make changes to address and/or name and other details – the roll is highly \ncurrent and accurate. \n\nPage 27 \n\nSection 22Section 22\n\n\n--- Page 28 ---\n\nOFFICIAL:SENSITIVE \n\nPage 28 \n\nSection 22\n\n\n--- Page 29 ---\n\nOFFICIAL:SENSITIVE \n\nSection 22\n\n\n--- Page 30 ---\n\nOFFICIAL:SENSITIVE \n\nPage 30 \n\nSection 22\n\n\n\n--- Page 1 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 2 ---\n\nOFFICIAL:SENSITIVE \n\n7.
