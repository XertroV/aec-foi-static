However, \"Attachment B: Additional OpenAI information\" was provided, detailing potential risks and limitations of OpenAI platforms (like ChatGPT and DALL-E), particularly in the context of elections. Key points from Attachment B include:\n    *   **Misrepresenting Electoral Processes or the AEC:** ChatGPT or similar AI models could provide inaccurate or \"hallucinated\" information about Australian electoral processes or the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC). This could include giving American-based responses to questions about Australian voting laws (e.g., compulsory voting).\n    *   **Misinformation/Disinformation:** AI tools can be used to generate deliberate disinformation. While some parameters exist to detect policy breaches, users may find ways to bypass these. DALL-E, an image generation AI, could be used to create convincing fake images of political nature, such as a political candidate being arrested or an election worker committing fraud.\n    *   **Taking AI Response as Fact:** Due to the advanced nature of AI, users might mistakenly accept AI-generated responses as factual, even when the AI \"hallucinates\" or fabricates references and sources."
