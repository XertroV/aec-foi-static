These codes comprehensively list categories of redacted material, primarily covering personal information (e.g., name, address, date of birth, citizenship, signature, political opinion, health, employment, bank details), business information (e.g., bank accounts, trade secrets, commercial value), and other exempt categories such as legal professional communication, deliberative material, and electoral roll material.\n\nThe document's relevance to FOI request LEX2088 is critical as it provides the explicit legal basis and specific types of information that have been redacted from the Federal Election 2022 candidate nomination forms for the division of Cook (AECEF060, AEC060-a, and AEC060-b) requested by the applicant. It serves as the justification for the heavy redactions noted in the request overview, confirming that information has been withheld in accordance with the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act 1982."
