Documents like \"Analysis of Indigenous Enrolment\" also relate to tracking outcomes.\n*   **Outcomes:** The schedule includes documents such as a \"Ministerial Submission\" (February 2019) on \"Publication of Indigenous enrolment rates\" and \"Estimates Briefs,\" which align with the request for final summary reports on outcomes. These suggest the provision of official figures and updates.\n*   **Indigenous Involvement / Cost and Staff:** Consistent with the broader FOI overview, this schedule *does not list any specific documents* pertaining to the number of Indigenous people involved in the design process or the final cost and exact staffing assigned to the project. The absence of such document descriptions in the schedule indicates that these details were likely not provided or found within the released set.\n\nIn summary, this document acts as an index to the FOI release, confirming the types of internal communications, analytical papers, and official submissions provided by the AEC regarding the new IEPP methodology, particularly its data-driven approach and performance tracking, while highlighting the lack of detailed information on Indigenous involvement and project expenditures."

  "prompt": "Considering this document as part of an FOI request, summarize the document and its relevance to the FOI request in markdown format. FYI the overview of the FOI request is: FOI request LS7888 sought documents (2018-2019) on the Australian Electoral Commission's (AEC) new methodology for its Indigenous Electoral Participation Program (IEPP), specifically its design, testing, and implementation, including catalysts, tracking, outcomes, Indigenous involvement, and cost/staff. The released documents, primarily emails and internal papers, reveal that the core of the new methodology is the direct matching of electoral roll data with Centrelink Indigeneity data, a more robust approach initiated internally to improve accuracy, replacing less reliable prior regression models. This method helped identify over 107,000 unenrolled Indigenous individuals, contributing to enrolment stimulation events (e.g., 2,646 new enrolments). The documents confirm estimated national Indigenous enrolment rates of 76.4% (June 2018) and 76.6% (June 2019), demonstrating a significant upward trend from previous estimates, though they provide limited information on Indigenous involvement in the design process or the final cost and exact staffing for the project.\n\nDocument Text:\n\nRequest for: \n\ndocuments relating to the design, testing and implementation of the AEC's new methodology during 2018 & 2019 for its Indigenous Electoral \nParticipation Program (IEPP), namely: \n\n1. \n\n2. \n\n3. \n\n4. \n\n5. \n\n6. \n\nCopies of documentations from 1 Jan 2018-31 Dec 2019 (inclusive) outlining planning for the new methodology. This should include any \ndocuments relating to the nature of catalyst for the new methodology starting to be planned (e.g. instructions from relevant Ministers to \nundertake a new methodology); \n\nCopies of any progress reports filed between 1 Jan 2018-31 Dec 2019 (inclusive) about the progress of the design, testing and \nimplementation of the new methodology—this can include internal emails between staffers if necessary; \n\nCopies of documentation from 1 Jan 2018-31 Dec 2019 (inclusive) outlining how implementation of the new methodology was tracked by the \nAEC, including any comparisons of results conducted with prior methodologies for assessing Indigenous enrolment rates; \n\nCopies of final summary reports relating to the outcomes of the new methodology from 1 Jan 2018-31 Dec 2019 (inclusive);  \n\nDocumentation from 1 Jan 2018-31 Dec 2019 (inclusive) outlining the number of Indigenous people involved by the AEC in the planning, \ndesign and implementation of the new methodology; and \n\nDocumentation from 1 Jan 2018-31 Dec 2019 (inclusive) outlining the final cost of the design, testing and implementation of the new \nmethodology—this should also include details of the number of AEC staffers assigned to the task. \n\nFOI REQUEST LS7888 \n\nSCHEDULE OF RELEASED DOCUMENTS \n\nDocument \nNo. \n\nDescription \n\nEmail from Guy Lewis, Assistant Director,
