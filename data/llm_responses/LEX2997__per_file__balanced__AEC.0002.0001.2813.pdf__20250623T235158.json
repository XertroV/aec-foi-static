Triggered by public complaints and media reports, the inquiry addressed allegations that Laming used pages disguised as community or news groups (e.g., \"Redland Bay Bulletin,\" \"Redlands Institute\") to promote political content and attack opponents without mandatory disclosures. The AEC confirmed an active investigation, citing broadened social media authorisation rules from 2018, and issued formal notices to Laming for information and to third parties (like Facebook) for data, with Facebook cooperating. The relevance of this document to the FOI request is its disclosure of the investigation's findings: that some pages were subsequently removed or updated with authorisation, while others remained active and unauthorised."

The AEC confirmed an active investigation, noting 2018 Electoral Act amendments broadened social media authorisation, and issued formal notices to Laming for detailed information and to third parties (like Facebook) for data, with Facebook confirming its cooperation. Findings revealed some pages were removed or updated with authorisation, while others remained active and unauthorised.\n [REQUEST OVERVIEW END] \n\n--- MAIN DOCUMENT TEXT START ---\n\n\n\n--- Page 1 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 2 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 3 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 4 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 5 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 6 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 7 ---\n\n\n\n"
