This deliberate information control prevents the public from assessing the validity of decisions, such as those impacting \"The New Liberals'\" party registration, and fuels suspicion that findings might be inconclusive, exaggerated, or selectively used to justify pre-determined outcomes, potentially manipulating the electoral landscape. Furthermore, commissioning a seemingly costly external \"expert\" report with public funds, only to then hide its core findings, exemplifies opaque use of taxpayer money and a fundamental undermining of government accountability and public trust."

  "prompt": "From a government skeptic's viewpoint, provide a concise, single-paragraph summary in markdown format of the following FOI request overview:\n\nSummary:\n\nThe core finding from these FOI documents, from a government skeptic's perspective, is the **staggering lack of transparency and outright obstruction of public scrutiny**. The requested \"supplemental report authored by Michael Turner\" (also referred to as the \"original research report\" in the document's structure) is almost entirely redacted in its most crucial section, Appendix 6, which is labelled \"Research Report.\" This means the public has been granted an FOI document that explicitly *denies* access to the actual research findings and data intended to inform government decisions.\n\nThis redaction raises significant concerns about:\n\n1.  **Deliberate Information Control and Lack of Transparency:** The very purpose of a Freedom of Information request is to shed light on government processes and the basis of their decisions. By redacting the entire substantive content of the research findings (pages 51-110, specifically Appendix 6), the government or the AEC is actively preventing the public from understanding the \"robust evidence\" that presumably guided their \"determination\" regarding \"The New Liberals\" party registration. This suggests an intent to control the narrative and shield the rationale behind official actions from independent review.\n\n2.  **Potential for Questionable Decision-Making:** Without access to the survey results, it's impossible for external observers to assess whether the \"confusion\" identified was genuinely significant enough to warrant any potential adverse decisions against \"The New Liberals.\" Was the \"causal effect\" of voter confusion as strong as implied by the commissioning of such a report? Or were the findings inconclusive, exaggerated, or selectively used to justify a pre-determined outcome? The redaction ensures these questions remain unanswered, fostering suspicion of power abuse in shaping the electoral landscape.\n\n3.  **Opaque Use of Public Funds:** The report outlines a detailed and seemingly extensive survey methodology conducted by an external \"expert\" from C|T Group Research. While the report justifies the online method by stating that alternatives (like CAPI) \"could have cost several hundred thousand dollars,\" the actual cost of *this* commissioned survey to the taxpayer remains undisclosed. Engaging an external firm for \"robust evidence,\" then hiding that evidence, smacks of potential waste, as the public cannot determine if the investment yielded publicly defensible results. The expertise outlined in Dr. Turner's CV only highlights that significant professional fees were likely incurred for a report whose critical findings are now secret.\n\nIn essence, these documents represent a government body commissioning a seemingly costly \"expert\" report to assess a public issue (voter confusion in elections) but then refusing to disclose the actual findings of that report under FOI. This is a prime example of government opacity, undermining accountability and fostering distrust in its decision-making processes.\n\nProvide only the markdown formatted summary text. Do not include any conversational filler or preamble."
