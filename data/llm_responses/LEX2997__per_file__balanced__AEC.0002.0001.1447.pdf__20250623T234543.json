            "text": "### Document Summary\nThis internal Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) email exchange, dated 8 April 2021, details an update on the status of Facebook pages associated with Andrew Laming MP. The communication from the Digital & Social Media Officer to the Principal Government Lawyer confirms that two previously monitored pages, \"Thornlands 4164\" and \"Redland Hospital: Let’s fight for fair funding,\" had been removed, with their direct URLs no longer active. Conversely, the \"Redlands Institute\" page was reported as still live, with specific post links provided. The email also suggests contacting Facebook with the identified links and relevant dates for post retrieval and advises continued screenshotting of page content and bios due to their dynamic nature.\n\n### Relevance to FOI Request\nThis document is highly relevant to the FOI request as it provides direct evidence of the AEC's ongoing investigation into Andrew Laming MP's Facebook pages for compliance with electoral authorisation laws. It specifically corroborates the FOI request's overview point that \"Findings revealed some pages were removed or updated with authorisation, while others remained active and unauthorised,\" by identifying specific pages that were either removed (\"Thornlands 4164,\" \"Redland Hospital\") or remained active (\"Redlands Institute\"). The internal advice to contact Facebook for data retrieval and to continue monitoring pages demonstrates the AEC's active steps in gathering evidence and managing the investigation as described in the request overview."

Do not include any conversational filler or preamble.To aid you, the overview of the FOI request is: [REQUEST OVERVIEW START] The FOI request disclosed documents detailing the Australian Electoral Commission's (AEC) investigation into Andrew Laming MP's Facebook pages for compliance with federal electoral authorisation laws. This inquiry was triggered by public complaints and media reports, notably from *The Guardian*, alleging Laming used numerous pages (e.g., \"Redland Bay Bulletin,\" \"Redlands Institute\") disguised as community or news groups to promote political content and attack opponents without mandatory disclosures. The AEC confirmed an active investigation, noting 2018 Electoral Act amendments broadened social media authorisation, and issued formal notices to Laming for detailed information and to third parties (like Facebook) for data, with Facebook confirming its cooperation. Findings revealed some pages were removed or updated with authorisation, while others remained active and unauthorised.\n [REQUEST OVERVIEW END] \n\n--- MAIN DOCUMENT TEXT START ---\n\n\n\n--- Page 1 ---\n\nAEC.0002.0001.1447\n\nFrom:                                 Louise ParrottSent:                                  Thu, 8 Apr 2021 16:02:13 +1000To:                                      Isabella McCormickCc:                                      Alex Morris;Justin SowdenSubject:                             RE: Facebook pages - links [SEC=OFFICIAL:Sensitive]Thanks so much for your help Bella and Alex, Louise Louise Parrott | Principal Government Lawyer Electoral Authorisations & Fraud Investigations Section | Legal & Procurement BranchAustralian Electoral CommissionT: (02) 6271 4759 X: 21418  From: Isabella McCormick <Isabella.McCormick@aec.gov.au> Sent: Thursday, 8 April 2021 3:40 PMTo: Louise Parrott <Louise.Parrott@aec.gov.au>Cc: Alex Morris <Alex.Morris@aec.gov.au>Subject: Facebook pages - links [SEC=OFFICIAL:Sensitive] Hi Louise, Alex and I have looked through the screenshots and found the following: Two pages associated with Mr Laming have now been removed – screenshots we’ve been using have included direct URLs to the pages, and we can confirm the links are no longer active. The short URLs for each page are:  Thornlands 4164 – www.facebook.com/ThornlandsQLD Redland Hospital: Let’s fight for fair funding – www.facebook.com/RedlandHospital  We would suggest a reasonable approach here would be for you to contact Facebook, provide the above links and a list of dates and times for relevant posts to be retrieved. The other page – Redlands Institute is still live and all of the links are below: Redland Institute https://www.facebook.com/RInstit/photos/289654448560573 https://www.facebook.com/RInstit/photos/343065656552785 https://www.facebook.com/RInstit/photos/311386569720694\n\n\n--- Page 2 ---\n\nAEC.0002.0001.1448\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/RInstit/photos/305907743601910 https://www.facebook.com/RInstit/posts/366292914230059 https://www.facebook.com/RInstit/posts/368025340723483 Assuming you already have but also a good idea to be taking screen shots of everything – including the page bio’s as they can change at any time.
