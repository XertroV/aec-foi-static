Its primary relevance to the FOI request is the inclusion of a news article titled \"Yes, ADHD could explain some of Andrew Laming’s behaviour. But it doesn’t make it OK.\" This article discusses impulsiveness as a characteristic of ADHD and its potential connection to Laming's actions, while explicitly stating it does not excuse them. While not directly pertaining to the specific allegations of unauthorised Facebook pages or electoral law compliance, the document demonstrates media commentary circulating at the time regarding Andrew Laming's conduct, which could be part of the broader context or information received by the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) during its investigation into Laming."

Do not include any conversational filler or preamble.To aid you, the overview of the FOI request is: [REQUEST OVERVIEW START] The FOI request disclosed documents detailing the Australian Electoral Commission's (AEC) investigation into Andrew Laming MP's Facebook pages for compliance with federal electoral authorisation laws. This inquiry was triggered by public complaints and media reports, notably from *The Guardian*, alleging Laming used numerous pages (e.g., \"Redland Bay Bulletin,\" \"Redlands Institute\") disguised as community or news groups to promote political content and attack opponents without mandatory disclosures. The AEC confirmed an active investigation, noting 2018 Electoral Act amendments broadened social media authorisation, and issued formal notices to Laming for detailed information and to third parties (like Facebook) for data, with Facebook confirming its cooperation. Findings revealed some pages were removed or updated with authorisation, while others remained active and unauthorised.\n [REQUEST OVERVIEW END] \n\n--- MAIN DOCUMENT TEXT START ---\n\n\n\n--- Page 1 ---\n\nAEC.0002.0001.2833\n\nFrom:                         The ConversationSent:                          Fri, 30 Apr 2021 06:29:52 +1000To:                              Andrew JohnsonSubject:                     Government to keep debt high until unemployment goes downCAUTION: This email originated from outside of the Australian Federal Government.

The new target of an unemployment rate between 4% and 5% will mean about 200,000 more Australians in work than the old target adopted in last year’s budget of an unemployment rate “comfortably below 6%”.The Treasurer says he won’t begin to tighten the budget settings until that happens. If unemployment does get that low and is sustained, it would be the first time since the governments of Robert Menzies, Harold Holt, John Gorton and William McMahon in the 1960s and early 1970s.
