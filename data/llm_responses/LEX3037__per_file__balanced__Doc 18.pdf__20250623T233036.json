            "text": "The document is an email exchange from May 2022 between the Australian Electoral Commission's (AEC) Electoral Integrity Assurance Taskforce (EIAT) and Google's YouTube Legal Support Team. It details a complaint made by the AEC regarding a video. The AEC's complaint cited potential contraventions of the s 44 Invasion of Privacy Act (QLD), Google's 'Respect Others' Terms of Service, and, crucially, a lack of authorisation in accordance with s 321D of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 (Cth). Google's response confirms that, following their review of the complaint, the content was \"blocked from view on the country domain.\"\n\nThis document is highly relevant to the FOI request (LEX3037) as it directly illustrates the AEC's proactive engagement with major tech companies, specifically Google, as part of its Electoral Integrity Assurance Taskforce's efforts. It exemplifies the collaboration and use of direct communication channels described in the FOI request overview, where the AEC identifies and refers non-compliant content—in this case, content violating electoral authorisation laws—for action by platforms to safeguard election integrity."
