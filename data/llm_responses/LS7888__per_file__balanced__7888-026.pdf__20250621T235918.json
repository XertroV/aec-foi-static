            "text": "This document, titled \"Analysis of Indigenous Enrolment Population Estimates,\" details the Australian Electoral Commission's (AEC) updated methodology for estimating Indigenous electoral enrolment rates and its initial outcomes.\n\n**Summary of Document Content:**\n\nThe document outlines the AEC's shift from an indirect, statistically-based regression model (used in 2014, which yielded \"alarmingly low\" enrolment rates) to a \"more direct method\" for estimating Indigenous enrolment. This new methodology leverages self-identified Indigeneity data from Centrelink, matched against the electoral roll.\n\nKey information provided includes:\n*   **Estimated Indigenous Enrolment Rate:** As at 30 June 2018, the estimated national Indigenous enrolment rate using this new methodology was **76.4%**.\n*   **Methodological Details:** The document explains the process of using Centrelink data, involving calculating raw enrolment rates for Centrelink clients (both Indigenous and non-Indigenous), applying an adjustment factor derived from the overall AEC enrolment rate, and then applying this factor to Indigenous and non-Indigenous Centrelink-based rates. It acknowledges that the method involves \"courageous assumptions\" and potential biases, yet is considered an \"improved approach.\"\n*   **Identification of Unenrolled:** Through the Centrelink data matching, the AEC identified **72,451 potentially unenrolled Indigenous Australians** as of mid-2018 (representing approximately 61% of the total estimated unenrolled Indigenous population at that time).\n*   **Enrolment Stimulation Outcomes:** A subsequent enrolment stimulation event in February/March 2019 resulted in the enrolment of **2,646 Indigenous Australians**, reducing the identified potentially unenrolled cohort to **69,143**.\n*   **Data Granularity:** The document includes detailed tables (Table 3 and 4) providing a breakdown of potentially unenrolled Indigenous Australians (under 65) and Indigenous Australians identified on the Centrelink file who were enrolled, presented by electoral division and state as at the 2019 close of rolls.\n*   **Limitations:** It notes difficulties in calculating reliable enrolment rates due to the lack of an Indigenous identifier on the Roll and less reliable Indigenous population estimates, and specifically highlights issues with data matching for Indigenous Australians aged 65 and over.\n\n**Relevance to FOI Request LS7888:**\n\nThis document is highly relevant to FOI request LS7888, which sought information on the AEC's new methodology for its Indigenous Electoral Participation Program (IEPP), particularly concerning its planning, implementation, and outcomes.\n\n*   **New Methodology (Planning & Implementation):** The document directly addresses the \"new methodology\" by detailing the strategic shift from the previous regression model to the Centrelink data-matching approach. It explains the core mechanics, assumptions, and improvements of this updated method, illustrating its \"planning\" (conceptual shift) and \"implementation\" (how the data is processed).\n*   **Outcomes:** It provides a key quantitative outcome of the new methodology: the significantly increased estimated Indigenous enrolment rate (76.4% by June 2018). It also details a direct outcome of leveraging this new data: the identification of a large cohort of potentially unenrolled Indigenous Australians and the results of a subsequent enrolment stimulation event (2,646 new enrolments), directly addressing the \"outcomes\" aspect of the FOI.\n*   **Indigenous Involvement/Costs/Staffing:** Consistent with the FOI overview, the document does not explicitly detail the number of Indigenous people involved in the methodology's development or its final costs and dedicated AEC staffing."

  "prompt": "Considering this document as part of an FOI request, summarize the document and its relevance to the FOI request in markdown format. FYI the overview of the FOI request is: FOI request LS7888 sought documents from 2018-2019 concerning the Australian Electoral Commission's (AEC) new methodology for its Indigenous Electoral Participation Program (IEPP), specifically regarding its planning, implementation, outcomes, Indigenous involvement, and costs. The released documents reveal the AEC transitioned to a more direct method for estimating Indigenous electoral enrolment rates, primarily by utilising self-identified Indigeneity data from Centrelink. This shift, driven by the availability of new Centrelink data, significantly increased estimated Indigenous enrolment rates from approximately 58% (under the old 2014 methodology) to 76.4% by June 2018 and 76.6% by June 2019. The documents detail the new methodology, its impact, and efforts to track enrolment stimulation, including identifying over 72,000 potentially unenrolled Indigenous Australians in mid-2018 and subsequent enrolment events. However, the released content did not explicitly detail the number of Indigenous people involved in the methodology's development or its final costs and dedicated AEC staffing.\n\nDocument Text:\n\n\n\n--- Page 1 ---\n\nAnalysis of Indigenous Enrolment \n\nPopulation Estimates \n\nThe ABS data provided at table 1 represents the ABS estimated resident Indigenous population 1=8 \nyears and over by state as at 2016 and projected to 30 June 2019. \n\nThis data has not been adjusted by the ABS to calculate estimated Indigenous enrolment eligible \npopulation, however, table 2 provides the AEC’s estimated Indigenous voting age population as at 30 \nJune 2018. \n\nTable 1 – ABS estimated resident and projected population - Indigenous Australians - 18 \nyears and over \n\nEstimated resident and projected population, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians, Series B, 18 \nyears and over - 30 June 2016 to 2019 (see note a) \n\nState/territory \n\nEstimated \nResident \nPopulation \n\nProjected Population \n\n2016 (see note b) \n\n2017 \n\n2018 \n\n2019 \n\nACT \n\nNSW \n\nNT(b) \n\nQLD \n\nSA \n\nTas \n\nVic \n\nWA \n\nAustralia (see note c) \n\n4,670 \n\n156,172 \n\n48,180 \n\n127,492 \n\n24,991 \n\n16,991 \n\n34,289 \n\n60,733 \n\n473,710 \n\n4,886 \n\n160,403 \n\n49,282 \n\n131,166 \n\n25,719 \n\n17,471 \n\n35,457 \n\n62,544 \n\n487,121 \n\n5,089 \n\n164,510 \n\n50,464 \n\n135,141 \n\n26,507 \n\n17,986 \n\n36,645 \n\n64,451 \n\n500,988 \n\n5,273 \n\n168,896 \n\n51,674 \n\n139,306 \n\n27,207 \n\n18,489 \n\n37,839 \n\n66,335 \n\n515,215 \n\nSource:  Australian Bureau of Statistics, Estimates and Projections, Aboriginal and Torres Strait \nIslander Australians, 2006 to 2031 (cat.

Yet the resulting enrolment and turnout \nrates in particular were alarmingly low, and hopefully represented a worst case picture. \n\nAs part of the Annual Roll Integrity Review (ARIR), the person-level matching between the Roll and \nCentrelink now includes Centrelink’s Indigenous indicator. However, as Centrelink customers \nrepresent only around half of the Roll, the matching (even if perfect) would be far from assigning all \nenrolments an Indigenous flag. Nevertheless, for the first time the AEC has a very large number of \nenrolled persons, over 6 million, with an explicit Indigenous status. \n\nThe enrolment rate, even for all persons regardless of indigeneity, is difficult to calculate reliably due \nto conceptual, collection and methodological differences between the Roll (numerator) and the ABS-\nbased enrolment-eligible population (denominator, “EEP”). In the case of the Indigenous population \n\nLS7888 Released Document No. 26Released under the Freedom of Information Act 1982\n\n\n--- Page 3 ---\n\nthese problems are magnified by having no Indigenous identifier on the Roll and less reliable \nestimates of Indigenous EEP.  \n\nHowever, matching the Roll to Centrelink data allows a more direct method of estimating the \nIndigenous enrolment rate. \n\nIt is still subject to quite courageous assumptions, but as fewer are required it likely represents an \nimproved approach. In summary: \n\n  For all Centrelink customers with an identified Indigenous or non-Indigenous status, \n\ncalculate the proportion on the Roll. This is the raw enrolment rate of Centrelink clients. \n  Calculate the ratio of the actual AEC enrolment rate versus the Centrelink-based rate, for the \nsame point in time. This is the overall factor to adjust any Centrelink-based rates to align \nwith AEC enrolment rates. \n\n  Apply the adjustment factor to raw Centrelink-based enrolment rates by Indigenous status \n\nto give Indigenous and non-Indigenous enrolment rates. \n\n  This process can be done at the State level, though results will have lower reliability. \n\nIt should be noted that while this method avoids indirectly modelling Indigenous enrolment rates via \ngeographic association, it does assume that any bias in Centrelink clients being enrolled is equal for \nIndigenous and non-Indigenous, and that there are no substantive Indigenous-status biases inherent \nin the Roll-to-Centrelink person matching. \n\nThe Centrelink client file with Indigenous indicator newly available to the AEC has presented an \nexcellent opportunity, via matching to the Roll and mark-off data, to improve estimation of \nIndigenous franchise KPIs.  \n\nWhile the results are subject to a number of non-trivial assumptions, the more direct estimation \nmethods lead to a higher likelihood of robust results. The figures should nevertheless still be \nregarded as indicative only. \n\nLS7888 Released Document No. 26Released under the Freedom of Information Act 1982\n\n\n--- Page 4 ---\n\nCentrelink Data \nThe number of Indigenous Australians that are identified both on the Centrelink file sent to the AEC \nin July 2018 and the electoral Roll does not represent all Indigenous enrolments. It is limited to those \nIndigenous Australians who both receive a Centrelink benefit and who have self-identified as \nIndigenous to Centrelink. \n\nAfter considerable data cleansing and analysis the AEC identified 72,451 potentially unenrolled \nIndigenous Australians. This represents around 61 per cent of the 118,581 Indigenous Australians \nthe AEC estimate were unenrolled as at 30 June 2018 (see table 2 above).  \n\nThe enrolment stimulation event conducted in February/March 2019 resulted in the enrolment of \n2,646 Indigenous Australians, reducing the estimated number of unenrolled Indigenous Australians \nidentified in the Centrelink dataset to 69,143. Table 3 sets out the distribution of this cohort across \nelectoral divisions.  \n\nIt is important to note that the potential unenrolled under 65 Indigenous Australians as at the 2019 \nclose of rolls represents those people that are on the Centrelink file sent to the AEC in July 2018 and \nwho were included in the February 2019 enrolment stimulation event but had not enrolled as at the \n2019 close of rolls (18 April 2019).  \n\nAnalysis of the Centrelink potentially unenrolled Indigenous Australians 65 years and older identified \nsignificant matching error, due to the quality of data input and the nature of the residential status of \nthis cohort. Work will be undertaken on the 2018-19 dataset to better understand this phenomenon \nto facilitate better targeting of potentially unenrolled indigenous Australians in the future. \n\nTable 3 -
