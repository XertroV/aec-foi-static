            "text": "This FOI document, LEX7939, starkly highlights the escalating and concerning expansion of the \"designated elector\" scheme, further eroding democratic accountability and social equity. Most notably, it reveals a shocking increase to 211 new declarations in the current financial year (2024/25) to date, a dramatic leap from 37 in 2022/23 and just 1 in 2023/24. This aggressive surge, with all recent declarations made by delegates rather than the Electoral Commissioner directly, signifies a significant restriction on fundamental electoral participation and undermines the progressive value of broad democratic access.\n\nThe document also underscores the severe lack of due process and accountability within the system. Of the eight internal review applications made across 2022/23 and 2024/25, a mere one was set aside, with the remaining seven being confirmed. This \"remarkably low success rate\" confirms the \"significant barriers\" individuals face in challenging these restrictions and regaining their right to vote. Furthermore, the complete absence of any applications for external review to the Administrative Review Tribunal since the scheme's inception is alarming, demonstrating a fundamental lack of independent oversight and accountability for what is effectively electoral disenfranchisement. The lack of detailed data breakdown by state, territory, or electoral division also perpetuates a concerning lack of transparency, hindering efforts to assess the potential disproportionate impact on vulnerable groups. Coupled with the fact that zero declarations have ceased to have effect by statutory provision, the document paints a picture of a permanent, expanding mechanism of electoral restriction with minimal safeguards."

  "prompt": "From a left-leaning perspective, summarize this specific document within the context of the FOI request. Emphasize its implications for social equity, environmental concerns, or democratic accountability. The overall FOI overview is: From a left-leaning perspective, the \"designated elector\" scheme, revealed by FOI documents, raises serious concerns about social justice and civil liberties by restricting electoral participation. The dramatic escalation to 211 new declarations in FY2024/25 year-to-date, from a handful previously, signals an aggressive expansion that undermines progressive values of broad democratic access. The system appears deeply flawed in its oversight, with a remarkably low success rate for internal reviews (only 1 of 8 set aside) and a complete absence of external appeals, suggesting individuals face significant barriers to challenging these restrictions or regaining their fundamental right to full electoral engagement. Combined with a lack of transparency regarding total numbers, this mechanism appears to be expanding without adequate accountability or due process safeguards, potentially disproportionately impacting vulnerable groups and diminishing essential democratic freedoms.\n\nDocument Text:\n\n\n\n--- Page 1 ---\n\nLEX7939  \n\nFOI Request LEX7939 â€“ Designated Electors Data  \n\nI seek access to the following, as at the close of rolls 7 April 2025: \n\n1.
