            "text": "### Document Summary: LS7888 Released Document No. 16.71919\n\nThis document is an email dated 4 December 2018 from Guy Lewis (AEC Assistant Director, Roll Program Design) to Delyse Paliaga, with Michael Roden and Stephanie Maxwell cc'd, concerning \"Indigenous missing\" voters. The email confirms that the Indigenous Electoral Participation Program (IEPP) 2016-17 National Program Plan (August 2016) reported that approximately 42% of Indigenous Australians were not enrolled to vote (or 58% were enrolled). This figure was derived from internal AEC research conducted by SRA, based on 2011 ABS Indigenous population data and AEC participation statistics from June 2014. The email notes this aligns with a 2014 Hansard statement by Snowden.\n\n### Relevance to FOI Request LS7888:\n\nThis document is highly relevant to FOI request LS7888, which sought information on the AEC's new methodology for its Indigenous Electoral Participation Program. While the document predates the full implementation and reporting of the outcomes from the new Centrelink data matching methodology (which identified significantly higher enrolment rates), it serves several key purposes:\n\n*   **Catalyst for New Methodology:** It explicitly details the historical context and the significant baseline problem (42% Indigenous unenrolment) that the AEC was operating with. This highlights the urgent need and serves as a direct *catalyst* for the development of a new, more robust approach to improve accuracy and replace less reliable prior models, as mentioned in the FOI request overview.\n*   **Previous Data Approach:** The document describes the older data sources and methodologies (internal SRA research, ABS data, AEC statistics from 2011-2014) that informed previous Indigenous enrolment estimates. This provides context for what the \"less reliable prior regression models\" were, demonstrating the contrast with the \"more robust approach\" of direct Centrelink data matching.\n*   **Measuring Progress:** By establishing a clear historical baseline of 58% Indigenous enrolment (or 42% missing), the document provides a critical point of comparison for evaluating the success and impact of the new methodology, which later identified national Indigenous enrolment rates of 76.4% (June 2018) and 76.6% (June 2019)."

  "prompt": "Considering this document as part of an FOI request, summarize the document and its relevance to the FOI request in markdown format. FYI the overview of the FOI request is: FOI request LS7888 sought documents (2018-2019) on the Australian Electoral Commission's (AEC) new methodology for its Indigenous Electoral Participation Program (IEPP), specifically its design, testing, and implementation, including catalysts, tracking, outcomes, Indigenous involvement, and cost/staff. The released documents, primarily emails and internal papers, reveal that the core of the new methodology is the direct matching of electoral roll data with Centrelink Indigeneity data, a more robust approach initiated internally to improve accuracy, replacing less reliable prior regression models. This method helped identify over 107,000 unenrolled Indigenous individuals, contributing to enrolment stimulation events (e.g., 2,646 new enrolments). The documents confirm estimated national Indigenous enrolment rates of 76.4% (June 2018) and 76.6% (June 2019), demonstrating a significant upward trend from previous estimates, though they provide limited information on Indigenous involvement in the design process or the final cost and exact staffing for the project.\n\nDocument Text:\n\nOwen Jones\n\nFrom:\nSent:\nTo:\nCc:\nSubject:\n\nGuy Lewis\nTuesday, 4 December 2018 1:32 PM\nDelyse Paliaga\nMichael Roden; Stephanie Maxwell\nIndigenous missing [SEC=UNCLASSIFIED]\n\nDelyse, just a note the 42% Indigenous missing. The Indigenous Electoral Participation Program 2016‐17 National \nProgram Plan, 22 August 2016 (page 4) states that internal AEC research suggests around 58 per cent are enrolled to \nvote, \non enrolment (2011) \nand AEC participation statistics in June 2014. \n\n. This data was sourced from Internal agency research \nconducted by SRA based on ABS Indigenous population data \n\nThis aligns with the Snowden statement in Hansard ‘In addition, in 2014 the AEC had already identified that 42% of \nIndigenous people were not enrolled to vote’. \n\nRegards \n\nGuy Lewis | Asst.
