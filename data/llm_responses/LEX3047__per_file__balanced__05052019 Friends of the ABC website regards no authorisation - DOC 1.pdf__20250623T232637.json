Do not include any conversational filler or preamble.To aid you, the overview of the FOI request is: [REQUEST OVERVIEW START] FOI Request LEX3047 obtained Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) documents concerning complaints made primarily in April and May 2019 about electoral advertisements lacking authorisation or being misleading. The released materials include public email complaints and the AEC's responses to various entities like \"Our Vote Our Community\" and \"Bass Deserves Better\" Facebook pages, \"RiteOn!\" website, and other media. The complaints predominantly highlighted the absence of required authorisation details on political advertising across digital and print platforms, with some also raising concerns about misleading \"community group\" portrayals or unauthorised paid ads. In response, the AEC consistently clarified 'electoral matter' and authorisation requirements under the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918, requested subjects to add necessary authorisations, cease distribution of non-compliant materials, and advised on potential penalties up to $25,200 for non-compliance, as well as obligations for \"disclosure entities.\"\n [REQUEST OVERVIEW END] \n\n--- MAIN DOCUMENT TEXT START ---\n\n\n\n--- Page 1 ---\n\nFrom:\nSent:\nTo:\nCc:\nSubject:\n\nDear \n\nAuthorisation Section\nMonday, 6 May 2019 12:55 PM\nAuthorisation Section; \n\nRE: Friends of the ABC electoral advertising  Attention \n[SEC=UNCLASSIFIED]\n\nThe AEC has received a further complaint that abcfriends.org.au, specifically the page \nhttps://me.abcfriends.org.au/index.php/2019/04/25/queensland-how-to-vote-report-card-on-parties/, contains \nelectoral matter but does not contain an authorisation for the purpose of the Electoral Act.  \n\nSpecifically for electronic media, where electoral matter is (a) an advertisement and all or part of the distribution or \nproduction of the advertisement was paid for, or (b) the matter is communicated by, or on behalf of, a disclosure \nentity, an authorisation is required. \n\nWhilst advertisement is not defined in the Electoral Act, it is defined in other Commonwealth legislation as, broadly, \nany matter that draws the attention of the public, or a segment of the public, to a product, service, person, \norganisation or line of conduct in a manner calculated to promote or oppose, directly or indirectly, that product, \nservice, person, organisation or line of conduct. \n\nIf part of the distribution or production of abcfriends.org.au was paid for, or Friends of the ABC will meet the \ndefinition of a disclosure entity under the Electoral Act, could you please add an authorisation to the website, \npreferably to the footer of each page or to the ‘About’ section? \n\nFor background, a person or entity is a disclosure entity at a particular time if the person or entity is any of the \nfollowing at that time: \n\n(a) a registered political party; \n(aa) a political campaigner (within the meaning of Part XX); \n(ab) a third party (within the meaning of Part XX); \n(b) an associated entity (within the meaning of Part XX); \n(c) a senator or a member of the House of Representatives; \n(d) a candidate in an election or by-election; \n(e) a person who was a candidate in: \n\n(i) an election or by-election of a member of the House of Representatives in the previous 4 years; \n\nor \n\n(ii) an election of Senators for a State or Territory in the previous 7 years; \n\n(f) a group of 2 or more candidates nominated for election to the Senate who have their names grouped in \n\nthe ballot papers in accordance with section 168; \n\n(g) a person or entity who: \n\n(i) is or will be required to provide a return under section 305A or 305B for the financial year in \n\nwhich the time occurs; or \n\n(ii) based on conduct in previous financial years, may be required to provide a return under section \n\n305A or 305B for the financial year in which the time occurs; \nexcept if the return is provided because of electoral expenditure incurred solely for the purposes of carrying \nout an opinion poll, or other research, relating to an election or the voting intentions of electors. \n\nIf you could please consider the above and advise by reply email either that abcfriends.org.au was not paid for and \nFriends of the ABC will not meet the definition of a disclosure entity and therefore the website does not requires an \nauthorisation, or that one of the circumstances mentioned above does apply and an authorisation will be added to \nthe website? \n\n1\n\n47F47F47F47F\n\n\n--- Page 2 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 3 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 4 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 5 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 6 ---\n\n6\n\n22\n\n"
