            "text": "This document is an email chain initiated by Vanessa Teague and Andrew Conway (August 31, 2021) to Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) Commissioner Tom Rogers, formally submitting their report on the AEC's Senate count. In this submission, they highlight a finding that the AEC's software \"breaks ties in a way that is not what is specified in the Electoral Act\" and notes other ambiguities requiring resolution through legislative amendment or a clarified algorithm. They offer assistance with code correction and support auditing paper ballots. The document's later email (October 19, 2021) from Kristen Wild (AEC) to Vanessa Teague then forwards Mr Rogers' (AEC) official response to their report.\n\n**Relevance to FOI Request:**\nThis document is directly relevant as it provides primary evidence of the 2021 Conway and Teague report's official submission to the AEC. It explicitly details one of the \"significant discrepancies\" identified by the report, namely the inconsistent tie-breaking rules, a core focus of the FOI request. Furthermore, it confirms the AEC's subsequent engagement and response to the report's findings, directly addressing the FOI's scope regarding identified issues with the counting algorithm and the AEC's actions in response."

  "prompt": "Considering this document as part of an FOI request, summarize the document and its relevance to the FOI request in markdown format. Provide only the markdown formatted summary text. Do not include any conversational filler or preamble.To aid you, the overview of the FOI request is: [REQUEST OVERVIEW START] This FOI request sought information concerning the accuracy, methodology, and identified issues with the Australian Electoral Commission's (AEC) Senate election counting algorithm and associated scrutiny processes. While early independent tests (2016-2017) found no issues replicating the AEC's 2013 WA Senate count, a subsequent 2021 report by Conway and Teague identified significant discrepancies. This report detailed that the AEC's software used tie-breaking rules inconsistent with the Electoral Act, noted the non-implementation of bulk exclusions (which can alter outcomes), and highlighted ambiguities in the Electoral Act concerning the count's termination. The report proposed various legislative and procedural recommendations, including publishing the AEC's code, correcting tie-breaking, and clarifying statutory definitions, to which the AEC subsequently responded.\n [REQUEST OVERVIEW END] \n\n--- MAIN DOCUMENT TEXT START ---\n\n\n\n--- Page 1 ---\n\nFrom:\nTo:\nCc:\nSubject:\nDate:\nAttachments:\n\nKristen Wild\nVanessa Teague\nandrewstvcount@greatcactus.org; Tom Rogers; Thomas Ryan\nRE: Corrections to the Senate Counting algorithm [SEC=OFFICIAL]\nTuesday, 19 October 2021 11:28:00 AM\n18 10 2021 - Dr Andrew Conway and Prof. Vanessa teague - Senate Counting and Scrutiny.pdf\nimage001.gif\nimage002.gif\nimage003.jpg\n\nGood morning\n\nPlease find the attached response from Mr Rogers.\n\nRegards\nKristen\n\nKristen Wild | Personal Assistant to the Commissioner\nExecutive Leadership Team\nAustralian Electoral Commission\n\nFrom: Vanessa Teague <Vanessa.Teague@anu.edu.au> \nSent: Tuesday, 31 August 2021 3:40 PM\nTo: Tom Rogers \nCc: andrewstvcount@greatcactus.org\nSubject: Corrections to the Senate Counting algorithm\n\n; Thomas Ryan \n\nCAUTION: This email originated from outside of the Australian Federal Government. Do not click links\nor open attachments unless you recognise the sender and know the content is safe.\n\nDear Mr Rogers and Mr Ryan,\n\nPlease find attached our report on the AEC's Senate count.\n\nWe have found one instance in which the software breaks ties in a way that is not what is\nspecified in the Electoral Act. We have also noted some other ambiguities that need to be\nresolved either by amending the Act or by otherwise committing to the exact counting\nalgorithm.\n\nWe would be very happy to help you correct the code - you can see our implementation here\nhttps://github.com/AndrewConway/ConcreteSTV.  We could easily make the necessary\nadjustments to the official code if it was similarly published online.\n\nAlso, we support recent proposals to audit randomly selected paper ballots at the end of the\ndigitizing process to give everyone evidence of the accuracy of the process. We would be\nhappy to help the AEC implement these measures securely and transparently.\n\nYours Sincerely,\n\nVanessa Teague and Andrew Conway.\n\nVanessa Teague\n\n\n--- Page 2 ---\n\nCEO, Thinking Cybersecurity Pty.
