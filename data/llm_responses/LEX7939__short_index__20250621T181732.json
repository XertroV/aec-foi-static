            "text": "FOI request LEX7939 sought specific statistical and administrative data from the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) regarding \"designated electors\" for recent financial years (2022/23 to 2024/25), covering elector numbers, declaration volumes, and review processes. While a future date's elector count was not directly provided, the AEC supplied historical data on designated electors from its website. The response detailed a fluctuating number of designated elector declarations—37 in 2022/23, 1 in 2023/24, and 211 in 2024/25 to date—all made by a delegate of the Electoral Commissioner. Internal reviews were minimal (4 applications in 2022/23 and 2024/25), with most decisions confirmed and only one set aside in 2024/25. Notably, there were no applications for external review to the Administrative Review Tribunal or instances of declarations ceasing effect under section 202AH(3) across the requested period."
