The sole substantive agenda item was a review of the delegate’s decision to deregister the ‘Australian People’s Party’. The Commission upheld the deregistration, affirming the delegate's decision of November 3, 2021, under section 137(6) of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918. The basis for the deregistration was the Commission's satisfaction that the party did not have at least 1,500 members.\n\n### Relevance to FOI Request:\n\nThis document is directly relevant to the FOI request as it falls within the specified date range (March 2, 2021, to October 19, 2022) for AEC meeting minutes. It details a specific Commission decision concerning political party deregistration, which is a core subject of the request. Furthermore, the decision explicitly references the party's failure to meet the 1,500-member requirement, directly illustrating the Commission's implementation of the legislative amendments increasing minimum membership thresholds, a key focus highlighted in the FOI request overview, and specifically names the \"Australian People's Party\" as a subject of deregistration discussions."

These documents primarily detail the Commission's decisions and discussions concerning political party registration, deregistration, and name changes, alongside the evolving methodology for verifying party membership, particularly in response to legislative amendments increasing the minimum member requirement from 500 to 1,500. Key discussions included seeking Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) advice on membership testing, and specific rulings on party names (e.g., \"The New Liberals,\" \"Liberal Democratic Party\"), deregistration (e.g., \"Australian People’s Party,\" \"VOTEFLUX.ORG\"), and re-registration (e.g., \"Seniors United Party of Australia\").\n [REQUEST OVERVIEW END] \n\n--- MAIN DOCUMENT TEXT START ---\n\n\n\n--- Page 1 ---\n\nMinutes \n\nAustralian Electoral Commission \nMeeting No. 278 \n\nDate: Tuesday 29 March 2022  Time: 2:00pm  Location: Microsoft Teams \n\nAttendees:  \nThe Hon.
