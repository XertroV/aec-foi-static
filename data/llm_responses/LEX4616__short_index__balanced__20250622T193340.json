The \"AEC Writing Style\" document outlines comprehensive rules for written communications, focusing on clarity, conciseness, appropriate tone, and inclusive language, including specific guidance for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, gender-neutral terms, and person-first language for disability, alongside grammar and formatting standards. Complementing this, the \"AEC Visual Identity Guide (Brand Guidelines)\" dictates strict standards for the AEC's visual presentation, covering core brand elements like the mandatory AEC logo (specifying its distinctive purple, minimum size, and usage rules), the required URL on all external communications, a WCAG-compliant color palette, specified typography, and guidelines for visual content and digital presence, with provisions for limited branding exceptions."

AEC Writing Style**\nThis document focuses on clarity, tone, and inclusivity in written communication:\n*   **Clarity and Conciseness:** Emphasizes writing in clear, concise, and direct language, recommending sentences of 20 words or less.\n*   **Audience and Tone:** Advises adapting tone (formal/informal) based on the audience (internal/external) while maintaining an active, accurate, accessible, inclusive, objective, and impartial voice.\n*   **Inclusive Language:** Provides specific guidance on using respectful terminology, including:\n    *   **Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples:** Preferring \"Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples\" (capitalized and plural when referring generally) and capitalizing terms like \"Elders,\" \"Traditional Owners,\" and \"Country.\" It clarifies that \"Indigenous\" should generally not be used as a standalone term for both groups.\n    *   **Gender-Neutral Language:** Recommending terms like \"chairperson\" instead of \"chairman\" and using gender-neutral pronouns (e.g., they/them) when gender is not specified.\n    *   **Person-First Language for Disability:** Advocating for phrases like \"people with disability\" instead of \"disabled people\" and avoiding euphemisms.\n    *   **Avoiding Emotional Language:** Cautioning against emotive terms such as \"suffering from\" or \"afflicted with.\"\n*   **Grammar and Formatting:** Covers rules for abbreviations, acronyms (spell out on first use, then use acronym in brackets), numbers (spell out 0-9, use figures for 10+), percentages (spell out \"per cent\" in body text), decimals, and proper referencing for official acts and bills.\n\n**2. AEC Visual Identity Guide (Brand Guidelines)**\nThis guide sets the standards for the AEC's visual presentation:\n*   **Core Brand Elements:** Identifies the AEC logo, AEC purple color, AEC voice, specific typography, and custom graphic devices (e.g., angled banner, speech bubble) as key recognizable elements.\n*   **Mandatory Elements:** Stipulates that the AEC logo and URL (aec.gov.au) must appear on all external AEC communications.\n*   **Logo Usage:** Provides strict rules for logo application, including preferred color (AEC purple on a white background), minimum size (45mm width), and required clear space. It explicitly prohibits altering, stretching, cropping, placing on an angle, or using the logo on busy backgrounds.\n*   **Secondary Logos:** Details how the AEC logo should be used in \"lock-ups\" with the Australian Government Coat of Arms or State logos, emphasizing visual balance.\n*   **Event Logos:** Explains that specific event logos (e.g., for elections or referendums) are distinct but must not replace the main AEC logo and should adhere to a consistent style, color palette, and font.\n*   **Colour Palette:** Establishes a primary color palette (dominant purple, supported by blue and grey) and a limited secondary palette, all designed to comply with WCAG 2.0 Accessibility Guidelines.\n*   **Typography:** Specifies Helvetica Neue LT Std as the primary typeface for headings and body text, Arial as a secondary typeface, and Roboto for web content.\n*   **Visual Content (Photography, Videography, Illustrations, Icons):** Provides guidelines for visual content to reflect AEC business and diversity, be professionally produced, use brand colors, and adhere to specific style templates.\n*   **Digital Presence:** Ensures all AEC websites, apps, and social media content maintain a consistent visual identity focused on accessibility, functionality, and usability.\n*   **Branding Exceptions:** Outlines specific situations where deviations from the corporate brand guidelines are permitted, such as approved internal campaigns or designated AEC programs (e.g., Education, Indigenous Electoral Participation Program, Indigo Program), provided they meet certain criteria and maintain a clear link back to the core AEC brand.\n\nProvide only the markdown formatted summary text. Do not include any conversational filler or preamble."
