            "text": "This \"Estimates Brief\" document, prepared for Supplementary Budget Estimates in October 2019, highlights a seemingly positive overall enrolment rate of 97.0 per cent for the 2019 federal election. However, when viewed through a right-leaning lens within the context of the broader FOI request, it substantiates significant concerns about government overreach and a departure from fiscal accountability.\n\nThe document's explicit focus on the \"Indigenous enrolment rate\" and the AEC's stated concern that \"Any gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous enrolment rates is concerning\" confirms a targeted, rather than neutral, approach to electoral participation. This proactive stance, described as \"investing in partnerships and targeted activities,\" aligns precisely with the FOI request's critique of the AEC's shift towards social engineering, actively pursuing specific demographic enrolment rates under a \"Closing the Gap\" mandate instead of applying electoral law neutrally. Such targeted interventions infringe on individual liberty by creating a de facto government-driven participation quota for specific groups, rather than simply facilitating universal access.\n\nFurthermore, the document's admission of an \"enrolment stimulation exercise\" targeting 410,000 people directly corroborates the FOI request's concerns regarding the undisclosed costs and a severe lack of financial transparency for these \"enrolment stimulation events.\" This signifies questionable fiscal responsibility, as taxpayer funds are allocated to active campaigning for specific demographic enrolment rather than core, neutral electoral functions. The mention of a \"different methodology\" for calculating Indigenous enrolment rates also subtly reinforces the broader FOI concern about \"courageous assumptions\" and potential data matching, raising further questions about accuracy and privacy implications. Overall, this document reveals an AEC moving beyond its essential role into an active, interventionist agency, which undermines market freedom by distorting the organic participation of citizens and expanding government's reach into areas of individual choice."

  "prompt": "From a right-leaning perspective, summarize this specific document within the context of the FOI request. Emphasize its implications for market freedom, government overreach, or national interest. The overall FOI overview is: From a right-leaning perspective, the Australian Electoral Commission's 2018-2019 reforms to its Indigenous Electoral Participation Program, while ostensibly aimed at improving enrolment, raise significant concerns regarding fiscal responsibility, individual liberty, and the scope of government. The undisclosed costs for designing, testing, and implementing the new methodology, alongside expenses for \"enrolment stimulation events,\" represent a severe lack of financial transparency and accountability for taxpayer funds. Furthermore, the reliance on cross-agency data sharing—matching Centrelink's self-identified Indigenous status with the electoral roll—creates a de facto administrative identifier, infringing on individual privacy and expanding government reach beyond its core electoral function into social engineering. This active pursuit of specific demographic enrolment rates, driven by a \"Closing the Gap\" mandate, deviates from the principle of limited government and highlights a move away from neutral application of electoral law, while the methodology's acknowledged \"courageous assumptions\" and fluctuating outcomes further question its precision and efficacy.\n\nDocument Text:\n\nESTIMATES BRIEF – HOT ISSUE \n\nSupplementary Budget Estimates, October 2019 \n\nCURRENT ENROLMENT FIGURES, TRENDS \n\nIssue \n\nFor the 2019 federal election, more Australians were enrolled than ever before— \nboth in terms of raw numbers and as a percentage of the eligible population. \n\nKey facts and figures \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n16,424,248 Australians were enrolled to vote in the 2019 federal election,\nrepresenting an enrolment rate of 97.0 per cent.\n\nThe youth enrolment rate (18-24 year olds) at the federal election was\n88.8 per cent. Like the general population, young people are enrolled at\nrecord levels.\n\n.\n\nThe Indigenous enrolment rate remained steady and for 2018-19 the\nnational estimated Indigenous enrolment rate is at 76.6 per cent.\n\nKey points \n\nThe Australian Electoral Commission works to ensure the full electoral\nparticipation of all eligible Australians. The electoral roll for the 2019\nfederal election was the largest and most complete ever.\n\nA record 16,424,248 Australians were determined as enrolled to vote in\nthe 2019 federal election, from of an estimated eligible population of\n16.9 million people. This represents an enrolment rate of 97.0 per cent, an\nincrease on the previous record rate for the 2016 federal election.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSB19-000044 \n\n.\n\n1 \n\nLS7888 Released Document No. 411919191919Released under the Freedom of Information Act 1982\fBackground \n\n2019 federal election \n\n A record 16,424,248 electors were enrolled from of an estimated eligible population of\n\n16.9 million people. This represents a national enrolment rate of 97.0 per cent.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImmediately following the roll close the AEC reported a preliminary enrolment rate of\n96.8 per cent. This, however, was subsequently revised to 97.0 per cent following the\napplication of more up-to-date eligible enrolment population estimates.\n\nThe enrolment rate exceeded the AEC’s target of 95 per cent in all states and territories\nexcept the Northern Territory, where it increased from 81.1 per cent at the 2016 election\nto 83.9 per cent.\n\nThe youth enrolment rate (18-24 year olds) was 88.8 per cent. Like the general\npopulation, young people are enrolled at record levels.\n\nTable: Summary of key enrolment metrics \n\nEnrolment metric \n\nFE2016 \n\nAMLPS \n\nFE2019 \n\nChange between \nFE2016 and FE2019 \n\nEnrolled electors \n\n15,676,659  16,011,891  16,424,248 \n\n 747,589\n\nEnrolment rate \n\nEstimated not \nenrolled \n\n95.0% \n\n95.7% \n\n97.0%   2.0 percentage points\n\n816,437 \n\n724,055 \n\n509,891 \n\n 306,546\n\nYouth enrolment rate \n\n86.7% \n\n88.6% \n\n88.8%   2.1 percentage points\n\nCurrent state of the roll \n\n As at 30 September 2019, the national enrolment rate was 96.8 per cent, which is\n\n0.2 percentage points lower than for the 2019 federal election.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is normal for the enrolment rate to decline following an election. The estimated number\nof people not enrolled has grown by around 37,000 since the election with the vast\nmajority of these being people who turned 18 following the election.\n\nIn the lead up to the 2019 election, the AEC conducted an enrolment stimulation exercise,\ntargeting 410,000 people nationally who were not enrolled.\n\nYouth enrolment \n\n Younger electors tend to enrol in proximity to an electoral event.\n\n\n\nThe youth enrolment rate (18-24 year olds) as at 30 September 2019 was 86.5 per cent\nwith 1,643,338 enrolled youth, a reduction of 2.3 percentage points since the federal\nelection.\n\n While the AEC works to maintain the youth enrolment rate as high as possible, it is not\n\nunusual for the youth enrolment rate to improve at the time of a federal election and then\ndecline between elections.\n\nSB19-000044 \n\n2 \n\nLS7888 Released Document No. 41Released under the Freedom of Information Act 1982\fIndigenous enrolment \n\n\n\nThe AEC commenced publication of Indigenous enrolment rate estimates by state and\nterritory as at 30 June 2018.\n\n A previous national Indigenous enrolment estimate of 58 per cent was calculated in 2014\n\nusing a different methodology.\n\n\n\nThe national Indigenous enrolment rate estimate remains steady and as at 30 June 2019\nthe rate was 76.6 per cent compared with 76.4 per cent in 2018.\n\n Any gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous enrolment rates is concerning.\n\n\n\nThe AEC is working to ensure the full electoral participation of all eligible Australians\nand is investing in partnerships and targeted activities that extend its reach into remote\ncommunities. Remote Area Mobile Polling remains an important component of election\nservice delivery.\n\nNorthern Territory enrolment \n\n\n\n\n\nEnrolment in the Northern Territory has shown consistent improvement.\n\nThe enrolment rate in the Northern Territory increased by 9.8 percentage points between\n30 June 2010 and 30 June 2019 while the national enrolment rate increased by\n7.4 percentage points.\n\nNorthern \nTerritory \n\nEnrolment \n\nEstimated \nEligible \nPopulation \n\nEnrolment \nrate \n\nEstimated not \nenrolled \n\n30/06/2010 \n30/06/2011 \n30/06/2012 \n30/06/2013 \n30/06/2014 \n30/06/2015 \n30/06/2016 \n30/06/2017 \n30/06/2018 \n30/06/2019 \n\n118,401 \n121,919 \n122,715 \n126,934 \n130,857 \n129,133 \n133,553 \n137,773 \n138,581 \n140,064 \n\n158,894 \n155,559 \n155,537 \n156,552 \n161,868 \n162,780 \n164,012 \n165,876 \n165,118 \n166,136 \n\n74.5% \n78.4% \n78.9% \n81.1% \n80.8% \n79.3% \n81.4% \n83.1% \n83.9% \n84.3% \n\n40,493 \n33,640 \n32,822 \n29,618 \n31,011 \n33,647 \n30,459 \n28,103 \n26,537 \n26,072 \n\nPublic reporting \n\n A range of enrolment statistics are published regularly on the AEC website.\n\nDate: \nCleared by (FAC): \nTelephone: \nBranch: \nContact officer: \nTelephone: \nConsultation: \nPDR number: \n\n22 October 2019 \nTim Courtney for Andrew Gately \n(02) 6271 4410\nRoll Management and Community Engagement\nRobyn Legg\n(02) 6271 4786\nNil\nSB19-000044\n\nSB19-000044 \n\n3 \n\nLS7888 Released Document No. 41Released under the Freedom of Information Act 1982\fREDACTION CODES \n\nPersonal Information (name) redacted. \n\nPersonal Information (date of birth) redacted. \n\nPersonal Information (photograph) redacted \n\nPersonal Information (facsimile of signature) redacted. \n\nPersonal Information (facsimile of manuscript initialling) redacted. \n\nPersonal Information (Individual’s address) redacted. \n\nPersonal Information (individual’s telephone number) redacted. \n\nPersonal Information (individual’s opinion) redacted. \n\nPersonal Information (opinion about individual) redacted. \n\nPersonal Information (employment history) redacted. \n\nPersonal Information (qualifications) redacted. \n\nPersonal Information (health) redacted. \n\nPersonal Information (identifying individual) redacted. \n\nBusiness information (Bank Account details) redacted. \n\nBusiness information (Billing Account details) redacted. \n\nBusiness information (internal operations) redacted. \n\nLegal Professional Communication redacted. \n\nDeliberative material redacted. \n\nIrrelevant material redacted. \n\nElectoral Roll material redacted. \n\nTests, examinations or audits material redacted. \n\nManagement or assessment of personnel material redacted. \n\nProper and efficient conduct of the operations of AEC material redacted. \n\nLawful methods or procedures for preventing, detecting, investigating, or \ndealing with matters arising out of, breaches or evasions of the law. \n\nTrade Secrets. \n\nCommercial valuable information. \n\nFinancial interests of the Commonwealth. \n\nProperty interests of the Commonwealth. \n\n1 \n\n2 \n\n3 \n\n4 \n\n5 \n\n6 \n\n7 \n\n8 \n\n9 \n\n10 \n\n11 \n\n12 \n\n13 \n\n14 \n\n15 \n\n16 \n\n17 \n\n18 \n\n19 \n\n20 \n\n21 \n\n22 \n\n23 \n\n24 \n\n25 \n\n26 \n\n27 \n\n28 \n\n\f\n\nProvide only the markdown formatted summary text.
