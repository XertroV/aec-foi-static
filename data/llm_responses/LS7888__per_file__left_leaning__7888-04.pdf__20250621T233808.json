            "text": "This document, a series of internal AEC emails from early 2018, starkly illuminates the core tensions of the Indigenous Electoral Participation Program (IEPP) from a left-leaning perspective. It explicitly details the AEC's extensive reliance on sensitive Centrelink data, revealing the identification of 107,607 \"Indigenous people that are only on the Centrelink file\" – meaning not yet on the electoral roll – with a substantial proportion (30.7%) being young people aged 18-24. This direct evidence reinforces significant civil liberties and privacy concerns, highlighting the blurring of lines between social support and civic duties that can erode trust and deter Indigenous individuals from accessing vital social services if they fear automatic data sharing without their explicit consent.\n\nThe discussions within the document illustrate an internal, data-driven approach to addressing Indigenous electoral disparity, focusing on technical solutions like analyzing Email/SMS provision rates and leveraging Births, Deaths, and Marriages (BDM) data to establish eligibility. While acknowledging lower enrolment response rates and \"higher level of disengagement\" among young Indigenous people in regions like NT, WA, and SA, the proposed solutions remain bureaucratic and devoid of community consultation. Crucially, the document contains no evidence of Indigenous involvement in the planning or design of these data-matching and outreach strategies, underscoring a fundamental failing in principles of self-determination and co-design within the program. Despite the stated aim of boosting participation, this document reveals a top-down methodology that prioritizes technical data solutions over genuine, community-led engagement, ultimately undermining the pursuit of genuine social equity and democratic accountability for Indigenous Australians."

  "prompt": "From a left-leaning perspective, summarize this specific document within the context of the FOI request. Emphasize its implications for social equity, environmental concerns, or democratic accountability. The overall FOI overview is: The Australian Electoral Commission's Indigenous Electoral Participation Program (IEPP) between 2018 and 2019 presents a mixed picture from a left-leaning perspective. While commendably recognizing and actively addressing the significant disparity in Indigenous electoral enrolment through pragmatic efforts like leveraging Centrelink data to boost participation towards \"Closing the Gap\" objectives, critical progressive shortcomings persist. A fundamental systemic failing is the continued absence of a direct Indigenous identifier on the federal roll, necessitating reliance on \"indicative only\" data. Crucially, the documents reveal no Indigenous involvement in the program's planning or design, a significant deviation from principles of self-determination and co-design. Furthermore, the extensive use of sensitive Centrelink data raises substantial civil liberties concerns regarding privacy and the blurring of lines between social support and civic duties, indicating that a deeper commitment to genuine equity and community-led solutions is still needed within this vital initiative.\n\nDocument Text:\n\nFrom: Angelo Rojas <Angelo.Rojas@aec.gov.au>  \nSent: Monday, 4 June 2018 3:45 PM \nTo: Guy Lewis <Guy.Lewis@aec.gov.au> \nCc: Stephanie Maxwell <Stephanie.Maxwell@aec.gov.au> \nSubject: FW: Indigenous data [SEC=UNCLASSIFIED] \n\nGuy - as discussed, the number of new enrolments for Indigenous not on the roll could be predicted to a fair extent by the proportion of Email/SMSs \nprovided by State. Further analysis of this shows that the strong correlation is for people aged 18-39. \n\nThe proportion of people aged 18-39 in NT, WA and SA who provided Email/SMS is low and so is their proportion of new enrolments. This analysis will be \nmore direct when Mike provides me with the extract that includes Email and/or SMS sent to confirm two hypothesis: \n\n1. We are sending less Email/SMS to these states.\n2. Additionally, enrolment response rates are also lower for these states than for the rest (higher level of disengagement).\n\nLS7888 Released Document No. 4Released under the Freedom of Information Act 1982\fReleased under the Freedom of Information Act 1982\fReleased under the Freedom of Information Act 1982\f60-69 \n70+ \n\n1.4% \n0.0% \n100.0% \n\n1.2% \n0.2% \n100.0% \n\n1.8% \n0.4% \n100.0% \n\n1.0% \n0.2% \n100.0% \n\n3.6% \n0.2% \n100.0% \n\n0.8% \n0.0% \n100.0% \n\n1.0% \n0.0% \n100.0% \n\n1.9% \n0.4% \n100.0% \n\n1.4% \n0.2% \n100.0% \n\nTotal % \n\nAngelo Rojas | Senior Project Officer  \nRoll Program & Community Engagement Section | Roll Management & Community Engagement Branch \n\nLS7888 Released Document No. 4Released under the Freedom of Information Act 1982 \n \n \n\fAustralian Electoral Commission \nT: (02) 6271 4507 X: 21336 M: \n\nFrom: Warrick Poyser  \nSent: Thursday, 8 March 2018 5:12 PM \nTo: Guy Lewis <Guy.Lewis@aec.gov.au> \nCc: Delyse Paliaga <Delyse.Paliaga@aec.gov.au>; Gina Dario <Gina.Dario@aec.gov.au>; Stephanie Maxwell \n<Stephanie.Maxwell@aec.gov.au>; Angelo Rojas <Angelo.Rojas@aec.gov.au>; Michael Roden <Michael.Roden@aec.gov.au> \nSubject: RE: Indigenous data [SEC=UNCLASSIFIED] \n\nThanks Guy – this data is very interesting. \nI suspect we may have to do something additional/special with the BDM data to establish eligibility prior to being able to do any meaningful \ndirect enrolment effort. \n\nWarrick Poyser  \nSystems Delivery & Modernisation Section | Operations Branch \nAustralian Electoral Commission \nT: (02) 6271 4452 X: 21319 M: \n\nFrom: Guy Lewis  \nSent: Thursday, 8 March 2018 3:38 PM \nTo: Warrick Poyser <Warrick.Poyser@aec.gov.au> \nCc: Delyse Paliaga <Delyse.Paliaga@aec.gov.au>; Gina Dario <Gina.Dario@aec.gov.au>; Stephanie Maxwell \n\nLS7888 Released Document No. 4777Released under the Freedom of Information Act 1982  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n\f<Stephanie.Maxwell@aec.gov.au>; Angelo Rojas <Angelo.Rojas@aec.gov.au>; Michael Roden <Michael.Roden@aec.gov.au> \nSubject: Indigenous data [SEC=UNCLASSIFIED] \n\nWarrick, the age breakdown of the 107,607 Indigenous people that are only on the Centrelink file is. \n\nYear of Birth \n1900 – 1920 \n1924 – 1930 \n1931 – 1940 \n1941 – 1950 \n1951 – 1960 \n1961 – 1970 \n1971 – 1980 \n1981 – 1990 \n1991 – 2000 \n2001 \n\nNumber \n23  \n239  \n944  \n2,667  \n6,201  \n12,345  \n16,216  \n23,863  \n41,597  \n3,512  \n\nTotal   107,607  \n\n% \n0.02% \n0.2% \n0.9% \n2.5% \n5.8% \n11.5% \n15.1% \n22.2% \n38.7% \n3.3% \n100% \n\nYouth Group (18 to 24)  \n\n33,008  \n\n30.7% \n\nMike is also rerunning the data against the deceased persons file and deleted records to remove those who are deceased and identify those who have been \nenrolled in the past.
