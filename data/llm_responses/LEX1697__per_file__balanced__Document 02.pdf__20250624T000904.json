            "text": "### Document Summary\n\nThis document comprises a series of email exchanges between the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC), primarily its Electoral Integrity and Communications Branch (including the Electoral Interference Taskforce - EIAT), and TikTok representatives from May to November 2021. The correspondence details collaborative efforts to ensure electoral integrity and prepare for the 2022 Federal election on the TikTok platform.\n\nKey discussions and actions include:\n*   **Establishing Communication Channels:** TikTok provided the AEC with a dedicated email alias for escalating concerning content, requesting specific details like content URLs and verification of AEC liaison personnel.\n*   **Transparency and Moderation:** TikTok offered the AEC and EIAT a virtual tour of its Transparency and Accountability Centre to demonstrate its recommendation system, content moderation, and data security approaches.\n*   **Combatting Misinformation:**\n    *   TikTok highlighted its ongoing fact-checking partnership with Agence France-Presse (AFP) to combat misinformation.\n    *   TikTok offered to run an on-platform Public Service Announcement (PSA) for the AEC, visible to users searching election-related hashtags, with draft wording and hashtag lists provided for AEC review and input.\n*   **Electoral Protocol and Scenarios:**\n    *   TikTok proposed collaborating on an \"electoral integrity declaration\" similar to an initiative with the Canadian Government.\n    *   The AEC responded by mentioning its ongoing work on an \"Online Media – Elections Protocol\" with other electoral management bodies and shared a template for \"online media content scenarios\" for TikTok's feedback.\n*   **AEC Presence on TikTok:** The AEC considered creating a verified TikTok account for direct public engagement but decided against it for the upcoming election due to internal capacity constraints, while remaining open to the option in the future.\n\n### Relevance to FOI Request LEX1697\n\nThis document is highly relevant to FOI request LEX1697 as it directly illustrates:\n*   **AEC correspondence with major social media platforms:** The entire document is a chain of emails between AEC personnel and TikTok, one of the specifically requested platforms (ByteDance/TikTok).\n*   **Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 compliance and 2022 Federal election preparations:** The core purpose of the engagement is to prepare for the 2022 Federal election by establishing protocols and mechanisms to address potential electoral interference and misinformation, which underpins the integrity requirements of the Act.\n*   **AEC's Electoral Integrity and Communications Branch (including the Electoral Interference Taskforce) extensively collaborating:** The AEC participants are explicitly from this branch and the EIAT, demonstrating their direct involvement and extensive collaboration.\n*   **Developing \"Electoral communications escalation scenarios\":** The sharing of the \"online media content scenarios\" template and discussions around an \"Online Media – Elections Protocol\" directly address the development of such frameworks.\n*   **Establishing clear communication channels:** TikTok's provision of a dedicated reporting email and guidelines for content escalation fulfills this objective.\n*   **Implementing protocols to combat misinformation and disinformation:** The discussions around TikTok's AFP fact-checking partnership, the proposal and development of AEC Public Service Announcements, and the broader engagement on an \"electoral integrity declaration\" all directly relate to implementing strategies to combat misinformation.\n*   **Discussions on TikTok's public service announcements and fact-checking partnerships:** These specific topics are a central theme of the correspondence, demonstrating the AEC's engagement with TikTok on these initiatives."

Do not include any conversational filler or preamble.To aid you, the overview of the FOI request is: [REQUEST OVERVIEW START] The FOI request LEX1697 sought Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) correspondence with major social media platforms (Meta, Twitter, Google, LinkedIn, ByteDance/TikTok) from May 2019, specifically concerning Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 compliance and 2022 Federal election preparations. The released documents, primarily emails, illustrate the AEC's Electoral Integrity and Communications Branch (including the Electoral Interference Taskforce) extensively collaborating with these platforms, particularly TikTok, Google, Twitter, and Meta. This ongoing engagement focused on developing \"Electoral communications escalation scenarios,\" establishing clear communication channels, and implementing protocols to combat misinformation and disinformation in anticipation of the 2022 Federal election, including discussions on TikTok's public service announcements and fact-checking partnerships, and Meta's new reporting portal.\n [REQUEST OVERVIEW END] \n\n--- MAIN DOCUMENT TEXT START ---\n\n\n\n--- Page 1 ---\n\nFrom:\nTo:\nCc:\nSubject:\nDate:\nAttachments:\n\nEIAT\nJulie Igglesden\nRe: RE: [External] TikTok follow-up on AEC PSA [SEC=OFFICIAL:Sensitive]\nWednesday, 10 November 2021 4:18:29 PM\nimage014.png\nimage018.jpg\nimage019.jpg\nimage001.gif\nimage002.gif\nimage021.png\nimage022.png\nimage016.png\nimage017.png\nimage020.png\nimage015.png\n\nCAUTION: This email originated from outside of the Australian Federal Government.

Do not click links or open attachments unless you recognise the sender and know the content is safe.\n\nGood morning Julie,\n\nFully appreciate the need for the AEC/EIAT to consider its options carefully!\n\nWe are glad to hear the AEC is interested in working with TikTok on an Election PSA. Our processes have slightly changed since the last time we did one with the NZ Government, so I will double-check the exact steps before sending them through to you. It is a fairly straightforward process which involves identifying relevant at-risk content (via #hashtags) and providing\ninformation that can be placed on platform to direct people to official / reputable sources when they encounter the identified content. \n\nI also note your point regarding the AEC's limited capacity to run a verified account on TikTok this election period. If the AEC continues to be interested in this option in the future, we can certainly revisit that then and outline the support we can provide. Below I have copied the Singaporean Government's TikTok account which has been positively reported on for its\nsuccess in engaging young people. Its a great example of how serious public safety information can be communicated in an entertaining (and low cost production) format. \n\nhttps://www.tiktok.com/@gov.sg?lang=en (@gov.sg)\n\nLastly, I'll just clarify that the fact-checking partnership with the AFP is ongoing and informs our day-to-day moderation processes. It is part of our broader Trust and Safety efforts (which includes engagement with official bodies such as the AEC) to combat misinformation on TikTok.\n\nI will follow up with you shortly regarding next steps for a PSA!\n\nKind regards\n\nOn Mon, Jul 12, 2021, 5:11 PM <Julie.Igglesden@aec.gov.au> wrote:\n\nHi\n\nComing back to you on the below email after some time to consume and consider.\n\nWhile the fact checking partnership seems like a fabulous initiative in those circumstances, we won’t be able to invest into something similar. As per our initial discussions though we are incredibly appreciative of the cohesive working arrangements we’ll share moving forward for any content referrals. The AEC also acknowledges the effort\nTik Tok is investing into their platform to identify and address disinformation, particularly around Australian federal electoral processes.\n\nWe would like to take up the offer of an AEC PSA during the election period. Very keen to understand this further – i.e. - how, when, formats/constraints for content we’d need to provide etc. Really appreciative of this offer as it will be valuable to reach the Australian Tik Tok audience with an AEC message of this sort, at the appropriate time.\n\nWe’ve carefully considered the idea of creating an AEC Tik Tok account but decided against it at this stage. Our thought process is that if we are to go down this path we need to properly invest the time and effort into appropriate content for the channel and we’re not positioned to do that at this time. Perhaps the federal election after this\none.\n\nKind Regards\nJulie\n\nJulie Igglesden | Electoral Interference Coordinator\nDigital Technology & Communications Branch\nAustralian Electoral Commission\nM: \nT: (02) 6271 4687 X:\n\nAustralian Electoral Commission logo\n\n@tiktok.com> \n\nFrom: \nSent: Friday, 18 June 2021 9:57 AM\nTo: Julie Igglesden <Julie.Igglesden@aec.gov.au>\nCc: Anastasia Batten <Anastasia.Batten@aec.gov.au>; EIAT <EIAT@aec.gov.au>\nSubject: TikTok follow-up on AFP partnership and AEC PSA and verified account\n\nCAUTION: This email originated from outside of the Australian Federal Government. Do not click links or open attachments unless you recognise the sender and know the content is safe.\n\nGood morning Julie, Anastasia, and Taskforce members\n\nThank you again for taking the time to participate in yesterday's Transparency and Accountability Centre tour. I hope the tour provided some useful information about TikTok's recommendation system, content moderation and data security approach. \n\nJust following up on a couple of things that were raised.\n\n1.    TikTok Australia entered into a partnership with Agence France-Presse (AFP) in 2020 to incorporate its expertise on fact-checking and combating misinformation. The article below provides some further detail on the AFP's reputation and how we are working together: \nhttps://www.afp.com/en/agency/press-releases-newsletter/afp-enters-partnership-tiktok-fact-checking-asia-pacific\n\n1.    On-platform PSA and verified AEC account \n\nOne thing that I forgot to mention is that we can offer the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) an on-platform Public Service Announcement (PSA) that will be seen by TikTok users when they search election related hashtags. The screenshot below provides a rough idea of how such a PSA could look.\n\nAustralian Electoral Commission\n\nIf desired, we are also able to help AEC activate and verify an official TikTok account. This would provide the AEC a presence on our platform and direct reach to our large and growing numbers of users. Below I have attached an example of content we worked in collaboration with the Australian eSafety Commission (and local TikTok creators) to produce for their\nverified account on TikTok. \n\nPlease let me know if you have any further questions or would like to follow-up on the above!\n\nKind regards\n\nOn Tue, Jun 15, 2021, 4:06 PM <\n\n@tiktok.com> wrote:\n\nThankyou!\n\nOn Tue, Jun 15, 2021, 1:59 PM <Anastasia.Batten@aec.gov.au> wrote:\n\nHi Nathan,\n\nYes of course, happy to do that in any instance so your IT team doesn’t have to move mountains!\n\nI’ll circulate it on our end now, thanks again.\n\nKind regards,\n\nAnastasia Batten | A/g Operations Manager\nVIC State Office | VIC State Office and Outposts\nAustralian Electoral Commission\nT: (03) 9285 7139 X: \n\nReleased by Australian Electoral Commission under the Freedom of Information Act 1982s 22s 22s 22s 22s 22s 22s 22s 22s 22s 22s 22\n\n\n--- Page 3 ---\n\nAustralian Electoral Commission logo\n\nAustralian Electoral Commission\n\n@tiktok.com> \n\nFrom:\nSent: Tuesday, 15 June 2021 1:50 PM\nTo: Anastasia Batten <Anastasia.Batten@aec.gov.au>\nCc: Julie Igglesden <Julie.Igglesden@aec.gov.au>\nSubject: Re: RE: [External] TikTok follow-up + government reporting channel [SEC=OFFICIAL:Sensitive]\n\nCAUTION: This email originated from outside of the Australian Federal Government.

However I do propose we organise the Transparency and Accountability Centre Tour first (for the AEC\nand Taskforce members together), as it is comprehensive and (from what I have seen) informative for regulators/government stakeholders. \n\nThe tour also includes speakers that we would likely ask to sit-in on meetings to discuss issues that may be of interest to particular agencies so it is an efficent way for us to address any\nquestions from the various departments on the EIAT. \n\nFrom that point onnwards, we can work out what other meetings are needed and I can arrange everyone on my end. \n\nLet me know if that approach sounds appropriate to you. We are a small team so where we can answers questions upfront or consolidate meetings helps us a lot!\n\nKind regards\n\nOn Tue, May 18, 2021, 1:21 PM <Julie.Igglesden@aec.gov.au> wrote:\n\nAfternoon\n\nOur pleasure, thank you also for taking the time to meet with us in person.\n\nWe will note the preferred reporting pathways below and follow that pattern as we go forward.

Your escalation and investigation flow diagrams in particular would be very useful for\nus to go through with our team.

I also extend that thanks to David and the other AEC and Taskforce attendees. \n\nBelow I have summarised the last slide our Trust and Safety team were unable to speak to on Friday due to the video connection dropping out.\n\nAgency Reporting and Support channels\n\nAs discussed, TikTok has a dedicated team managing election risks and responding to issues or concerning content in the lead-up to and on the day\nof an election.\n\nTo enable timely responses to concerning content the AEC may wish for TikTok to review, we ask that any escalation/request be put in email\nthrough to\nThe email should include a summary of the report/incident and the exact URL(s) of the relevant content. \n\n@tiktok.com. \n\nWe would also ask that these emails either be sent from a team email alias or from individual(s) within AEC that you can identify as a liaison with\nTikTok (e.g. social media manager/response team). \nThis ensures we are addressing issues from the appropriate authority/personnel within TEC.\n\nPlease let me know if any of the above is unclear or if you have any more questions! \n\nKind regards,\n\n Sydney Office\n\nTel: AUS +\nEmail\n\n@tiktok.com\n\nImage removed by sender.\n\nFollow us on  \n\nAttachments ar-\n\nDISCLAIMER:\n\nIf you have received this transmission in error please notify us immediately by return email and delete all copies.
