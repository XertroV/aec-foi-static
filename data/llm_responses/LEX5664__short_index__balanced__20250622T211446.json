Released documents included a partially redacted Town Hall transcript and a full transcript of questions, revealing significant discussion around the \"Robodebt\" scandal. An anonymous question specifically requested an independent ethics adviser for the AEC, citing concerns about Robodebt. In response, AEC leadership, including the Moderator and Electoral Commissioner, disavowed any similar systemic issues within the AEC's history and directed staff to existing ethics resources like the Australian Public Service Commission (APSC), noting future integrity work by the APS following Robodebt's findings."

Could we have an independent ethics adviser, not an AEC SES, so if we need to consult someone we can.\"\n*   **AEC's Response to Ethics Concerns:**\n    *   The Moderator (Jeff) responded by acknowledging Robodebt as \"terrible\" and affirming that no similar behaviour or anything close to it had been observed within the AEC during his 10 years there.\n    *   For independent advice, Jeff suggested the Australian Public Service Commission (APSC) and highlighted various other avenues for seeking advice or escalating concerns, including anonymously.\n    *   The Electoral Commissioner, Tom Rogers, also addressed the \"Robo debt question,\" echoing Jeff's sentiment and stating he had \"certainly never seen anything like that, any systemic large scale events such as that internally in the AC,\" even going back 30-40 years in the AEC's history.\n    *   A follow-up comment by another anonymous user and a moderator's reply further reinforced the APSC's Ethics Advisory Service as a resource, noting that the APS would be doing more work around integrity following the findings of Robodebt.\n\nProvide only the markdown formatted summary text. Do not include any conversational filler or preamble."
