Could we have an independent ethics adviser, not an AEC SES, so if we need to consult someone we can.\"\n*   **AEC's Response to Ethics Concerns:**\n    *   The Moderator (Jeff) responded by acknowledging Robodebt as \"terrible\" and affirming that no similar behaviour or anything close to it had been observed within the AEC during his 10 years there.\n    *   For independent advice, Jeff suggested the Australian Public Service Commission (APSC) and highlighted various other avenues for seeking advice or escalating concerns, including anonymously.\n    *   The Electoral Commissioner, Tom Rogers, also addressed the \"Robo debt question,\" echoing Jeff's sentiment and stating he had \"certainly never seen anything like that, any systemic large scale events such as that internally in the AC,\" even going back 30-40 years in the AEC's history.\n    *   A follow-up comment by another anonymous user and a moderator's reply further reinforced the APSC's Ethics Advisory Service as a resource, noting that the APS would be doing more work around integrity following the findings of Robodebt."

Uh, I'm Tom Rogers. For those that haven't met me, and I know we've got a number \nof new staff and I'm the electoral commissioner. Let me welcome you to this Town Hall and to start \nthat I'd like to \n\n0:25 \nbegin by acknowledging the traditional custodians of the country throughout Australia and pay my \nrespects to the elders past and present. So welcome. \n\n0:35 \nThese town halls have proven to be very popular. It's a great way of us being able to give you an \nagency wide update of what's occurring, but also importantly to give you the opportunity to ask any \nquestions that you might have of any of the executive \n\n0:48 \nfor those that have been on these town halls before, you'll know the format. Each of us, each member \nof the executive is going to talk for a bit about what we're doing or issues that we think you might be \ninterested in. \n\n1:01 \nAnd at the same time, we'll have time for questions. So just to remind people, you can ask questions \nin a couple of different ways. You can wait till the end of everyone talking or if you've got a question \non the way through, please ask it in the chat function, in the Q&A function. We'll do everything we \npossibly can to answer those questions. We've got a good track record of answering all of those \nquestions. If we can't just because of time or it's too long, we'll take it on notice and come back to \nyou. We'll either respond \n\n1:31 \nand writing or I'll get one of the executive team to jump on and actually answer the question \npersonally where we can. So again, thank you for that. \n\nSection 22\n\n\n--- Page 2 ---\n\nSection 22\n\n\n--- Page 3 ---\n\nSection 22\n\n\n--- Page 4 ---\n\nSection 22\n\n\n--- Page 5 ---\n\nSection 22\n\n\n--- Page 6 ---\n\nSection 22\n\n\n--- Page 7 ---\n\nSection 22\n\n\n--- Page 8 ---\n\nSection 22\n\n\n--- Page 9 ---\n\nSection 22\n\n\n--- Page 10 ---\n\nSection 22\n\n\n--- Page 11 ---\n\nSection 22\n\n\n--- Page 12 ---\n\nSection 22\n\n\n--- Page 13 ---\n\nSection 22\n\n\n--- Page 14 ---\n\nSection 22\n\n\n--- Page 15 ---\n\nSection 22\n\n\n--- Page 16 ---\n\nSection 22\n\n\n--- Page 17 ---\n\nSection 22\n\n\n--- Page 18 ---\n\nSection 22\n\n\n--- Page 19 ---\n\nSection 22\n\n\n--- Page 20 ---\n\n53:23 \nUh, the Robo debt. \n\n53:26 \nUm question.

Could we have an \nreply from Moderator \nindependent ethics adviser, not an AEC SES, so if we need to consult someone we can. \nModerator \n11/15/2023 2:46 PM \n\nThat is an interesting perspective. Firstly I would say what occurred in Robodebt is \nterrible and I have not seen any of that sort of behaviour, or anything close to it, in the \nAEC in my 10 years here. If you are looking for something independent I would suggest \nthe Australian Public Service Commission but there are many ways to seek advise in the \nQuestion from anonymous user \npublic service or to escalate concerns, including anonymously. Thanks, Jeff \nAnonymous \n11/15/2023 2:39 PM \n\n8\nThis is a comment in relation to a previous question about impartial ethics advice - the \nAPSC has an Ethics Advisory Service https://www.apsc.gov.au/working-\nreply from Moderator \naps/integrity/ethics-advisory-service \nModerator \n11/15/2023 2:47 PM \n\nThanks for the comment. Following the findings of Robodebt the APS will be doing more \nwork around this. You'll also see on the APSC website that there are a range of avenues \nopen to raise concerns, including line managers harassment contact officers yees for \ndealing with concerns, central conduct or integrity units nominated individuals or \nteams in HR, including employee advice units or hotlines, or fraud prevention and \ncontrol units or hotlines email reporting addresses ‘authorised officers’ who receive \npublic interest disclosures.\n\nProvide only the markdown formatted summary text.
