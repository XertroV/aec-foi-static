The document notes widespread negative public sentiment, expressing skepticism about the AEC's impartiality and effectiveness, with comments like \"don't expect AEC to do anything,\" \"the AEC is biased,\" and \"they don't have any power to take action.\" It indicates the AEC's awareness of this public discourse and an intention to monitor and respond to Twitter traffic. The document's relevance to the FOI request is its insight into the public perception and scrutiny surrounding the AEC's handling of such investigations, particularly given the high-profile nature of the Laming inquiry triggered by public complaints and media reports."

  "prompt": "Considering this document as part of an FOI request, summarize the document and its relevance to the FOI request in markdown format. Provide only the markdown formatted summary text. Do not include any conversational filler or preamble.To aid you, the overview of the FOI request is: [REQUEST OVERVIEW START] The FOI request disclosed documents detailing the Australian Electoral Commission's (AEC) investigation into Andrew Laming MP's Facebook pages for compliance with federal electoral authorisation laws. This inquiry was triggered by public complaints and media reports, notably from *The Guardian*, alleging Laming used numerous pages (e.g., \"Redland Bay Bulletin,\" \"Redlands Institute\") disguised as community or news groups to promote political content and attack opponents without mandatory disclosures. The AEC confirmed an active investigation, noting 2018 Electoral Act amendments broadened social media authorisation, and issued formal notices to Laming for detailed information and to third parties (like Facebook) for data, with Facebook confirming its cooperation. Findings revealed some pages were removed or updated with authorisation, while others remained active and unauthorised.\n [REQUEST OVERVIEW END] \n\n--- MAIN DOCUMENT TEXT START ---\n\n\n\n--- Page 1 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 2 ---\n\nAEC.0002.0001.1180\n\nTwitter activityThere is a reasonable level of Twitter activity on the matter off the back of tweets like the ones below. The general response in relation to the AEC – from members of the public - is a mixture of “don’t expect AEC to do anything”, “the AEC is biased so won’t take action” and “they don’t have any power to take action”.  As is standard on the channel – purple signs have been raised a number of times.  We will monitor Twitter traffic and provide some select responses – based on the below enquiry response.
