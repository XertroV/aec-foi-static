It provides precise figures and specific information for most of the detailed statistics sought, covering:\n\n*   The number of new \"designated elector\" declarations across the specified financial years (2022/23, 2023/24, 2024/25).\n*   Confirmation that all declarations were made by a delegate, addressing the authority query.\n*   Comprehensive data on internal review applications and their outcomes for the requested periods.\n*   Confirmation of no applications to the Administrative Review Tribunal within the specified timeframe.\n*   Confirmation of no declarations ceasing effect under s 202AH(3) for the periods.\n\nWhile it clarifies the unavailability of future-dated or geographically broken-down designated elector numbers, it fully addresses the statistical aspects concerning new declarations, review processes, and cessation events, thereby directly fulfilling the core requirements of the FOI request."
