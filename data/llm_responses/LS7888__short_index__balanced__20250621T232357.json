The released documents, primarily emails and internal papers, reveal that the core of the new methodology is the direct matching of electoral roll data with Centrelink Indigeneity data, a more robust approach initiated internally to improve accuracy, replacing less reliable prior regression models. This method helped identify over 107,000 unenrolled Indigenous individuals, contributing to enrolment stimulation events (e.g., 2,646 new enrolments). The documents confirm estimated national Indigenous enrolment rates of 76.4% (June 2018) and 76.6% (June 2019), demonstrating a significant upward trend from previous estimates, though they provide limited information on Indigenous involvement in the design process or the final cost and exact staffing for the project."

  "prompt": "Create a concise, single-paragraph summary in markdown format of the following FOI request summary:\n\nSummary:\n\nThis summary details the FOI request LS7888 and the documents released, focusing on the design, testing, and implementation of the AEC's new methodology for its Indigenous Electoral Participation Program (IEPP).\n\n### Main Purpose of the FOI Request\n\nThe FOI request sought documents from 1 January 2018 to 31 December 2019 relating to the design, testing, and implementation of the Australian Electoral Commission's (AEC) new methodology for its Indigenous Electoral Participation Program (IEPP). Specifically, it requested:\n1.  Planning documents for the new methodology, including any catalysts for its initiation (e.g., ministerial instructions).\n2.  Progress reports on the design, testing, and implementation, including internal emails.\n3.  Documentation on how implementation was tracked, including comparisons with prior methodologies.\n4.  Final summary reports on the outcomes of the new methodology.\n5.  Documentation on the number of Indigenous people involved in the planning, design, and implementation.\n6.  Documentation on the final cost and number of AEC staffers assigned to the task.\n\n### Documents from the FOI Request\n\nThe released documents comprise a schedule of 41 items (some subsumed into others), primarily consisting of:\n*   **Emails:** Extensive internal email correspondence between various AEC staff members (Assistant Directors, Senior Project Officers, Directors, Assistant Commissioners, Deputy Electoral Commissioner, Electoral Commissioner) across different branches (Roll Management & Community Engagement, Operations, Business Intelligence, Research & Electoral Integrity) and one external email from the Department of Finance.\n*   **Internal Papers/Minutes:**\n    *   \"Minute... re Using DHS Indigeneity data to enhance Indigenous enrolment.\"\n    *   Papers titled \"Indigenous Franchise KPIs using Centrelink data.\"\n    *   Papers titled \"Analysis of Indigenous Enrolment.\"\n*   **Official Submissions/Briefs:**\n    *   \"Ministerial Submission... re Publication of Indigenous enrolment rates.\"\n    *   \"Estimates Brief â€“ Hot Issue\" documents providing enrolment figures and trends for parliamentary estimates.\n\n### Main Content from the FOI Request Documents\n\nThe documents provide substantial insight into points 1, 2, 3, and 4 of the request, with limited information on points 5 and 6.\n\n*   **New Methodology (Design, Testing, Implementation):**\n    *   **Core of the methodology:** The key change in methodology for estimating Indigenous enrolment rates is the **direct matching of electoral roll data with Centrelink (Department of Human Services) Indigeneity data**. This allows the AEC to identify individuals who have self-identified as Indigenous to Centrelink and then cross-reference their enrolment status. This method is described as a \"more direct method\" leading to a \"higher likelihood of robust results\" compared to previous indirect estimation methods (e.g., regression models used in 2014 that \"did not fit the data particularly well\").\n    *   **Planning & Catalyst:** The use of Centrelink data for this purpose \"came to fruition in 2017\" following informal proposals within the AEC's Research Section, integrated into the Annual Roll Integrity Review (ARIR). While ministerial offices later requested and were briefed on the data, the impetus appears to be internal to improve data accuracy (\"to enhance Indigenous enrolment\").\n    *   **Implementation Tracking & Data Use:**\n        *   Initial analysis in March 2018 identified over 107,000 Indigenous people \"only on the Centrelink file,\" with a significant portion (30.7%) being youth (18-24).\n        *   The methodology involves calculating raw enrolment rates for Centrelink clients, benchmarking them against overall AEC enrolment rates, and applying adjustment factors to estimate Indigenous and non-Indigenous enrolment rates.\n        *   Detailed \"Analysis of Indigenous Enrolment\" papers provide state-by-state and electoral division breakdowns of estimated Indigenous voting-age population, estimated enrolled, and estimated unenrolled figures (e.g., as at 30 June 2018).\n        *   The Centrelink data was used for \"enrolment stimulation events\" (e.g., February/March 2019), which led to the enrolment of 2,646 Indigenous Australians, reducing the identified \"potentially unenrolled\" cohort.\n        *   Internal emails highlight ongoing data quality discussions, such as issues with matching older Indigenous Australians and the need for clear caveats when presenting \"estimates on top of estimates\" to Ministers due to inherent assumptions and potential biases in the Centrelink data. In September 2019, internal reviews of the 2019 Indigenous KPI numbers were still ongoing, with adjustments being made.\n\n*   **Comparisons with Prior Methodologies:**\n    *   The documents explicitly state that the new Centrelink-based method replaces older regression models from 2014, which yielded \"alarmingly low\" and \"worst case picture\" estimates (e.g., 58% national Indigenous enrolment rate). The new method is considered an \"improved approach.\"\n\n*   **Final Summary Reports & Outcomes:**\n    *   As of 30 June 2018, the estimated national Indigenous enrolment rate was **76.4%**, a significant increase from previous estimates, demonstrating a \"faster pace\" of growth than the Roll as a whole.\n    *   By 30 June 2019, the national estimated Indigenous enrolment rate slightly increased to **76.6%**, continuing an upward trend from 74.7% in 2017.\n    *   While nationally stable, state-level variations were noted, such as a slight decrease in NSW's Indigenous enrolment rate (from 87.3% to 86.2%) balanced by increases in NT, WA, and QLD.\n\n*   **Indigenous People Involved & Staffing/Cost:**\n    *   The released documents do not contain specific information on the **number of Indigenous people involved** in the planning, design, and implementation of the methodology in terms of AEC staff or external consultants.\n    *   Similarly, the documents do not detail the **final cost** of the design, testing, and implementation, nor the precise **number of AEC staffers specifically assigned** to this task. The documents do indicate involvement from various staff within the Roll Management & Community Engagement and Operations branches.\n\nProvide only the markdown formatted summary text. Do not include any conversational filler or preamble."
