Released documents include AEC media releases and their drafts, extensive internal emails discussing and clearing these statements, EIAT Board meeting records (agendas, minutes, talking points), and formal EIAT advice to the Electoral Commissioner. These materials illustrate the AEC's process of assuring public confidence in election integrity, highlight EIAT's central role in informing public messaging, and detail internal review and clearance procedures for public statements. Notably, some withheld documents point to inter-agency input, including from intelligence agencies, and exemptions like \"damage to the security of the Commonwealth\" (Section 33(a)(i)) were applied to certain email chains, indicating sensitive discussions related to election security."
