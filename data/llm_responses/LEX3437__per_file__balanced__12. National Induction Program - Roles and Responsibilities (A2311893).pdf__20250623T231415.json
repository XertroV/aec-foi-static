            "text": "This document outlines the Australian Electoral Commission's (AEC) National Induction Program (NIP), a mandatory program for new or promoted ongoing and non-ongoing staff (APS2-SES levels). It details the roles and responsibilities of Participants, Line Managers, Local Induction Advisers, Executive Level Officers, Local Trainers and Facilitators, the National Electoral Education Centre (NEEC), and the National Training and Education Unit (NTEU) in delivering and completing the program.\n\nA central theme across all roles is the explicit requirement to \"behave in accordance with the APS values and code of conduct\" and to \"conduct themselves in a professional manner, supporting the AEC’s values and commitments.\" Line Managers, Local Induction Advisers, Local Trainers, and NEEC staff are specifically instructed to use and refer to \"approved AEC policies and procedures only\" and to \"refrain from voicing personal opinion on AEC policies, procedures and/or stakeholders during delivery,\" which underscores the commitment to political neutrality and consistent application of guidelines. The NIP aims to ensure staff are set up for success and understand their obligations within the AEC and broader Australian Public Service (APS) framework.\n\nThis document is highly relevant to FOI Request No. LEX3437 as it directly addresses \"AEC policies governing staff adherence to APS Values, Employment Principles, and Code of Conduct.\" It details the comprehensive induction program designed to instil these values, principles, and conduct expectations from the commencement of employment, and outlines the responsibilities of various staff levels in ensuring compliance and reinforcing ethical behaviour and political neutrality. While it does not cover limitations on staff telephone communication with the public or MOUs with the AFP, it provides significant detail on the AEC's approach to staff conduct and values."
