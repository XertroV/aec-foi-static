The request also revealed a small number of internal review applications (four in FY2022/23 and four in FY2024/25), predominantly resulting in confirmed decisions, though one was set aside in FY2024/25. No applications for review to the Administrative Review Tribunal or instances of declarations ceasing effect under s 202AH(3) were recorded for the specified periods.\n\nDocument Text:\n\nLEX7939  \n\nFOI Request LEX7939 â€“ Designated Electors Data  \n\nI seek access to the following, as at the close of rolls 7 April 2025: \n\n1.
