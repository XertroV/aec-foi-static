  "prompt": "With a highly critical view, provide a scathing, single-paragraph summary in markdown format of the following FOI request overview:\n\nSummary:\n\nThe released FOI documents paint a damning picture of systemic opacity, profound incompetence, and deliberate deception within the government's approach to the referendum advertising campaign. Instead of transparency, the public is met with a wall of redactions, effectively gutting the documents of any meaningful insight and confirming a culture of concealment.\n\n**1. A Deliberate Campaign of Secrecy and Obfuscation:**\nThe sheer volume of redactions, particularly the pervasive use of \"s 22\" (irrelevant content removed) and \"s 47\" (confidentiality, commercial-in-confidence, personal privacy), is not merely administrative but a calculated act of obfuscation. Hundreds of pages are rendered unintelligible, proving that the government's priority is to shield its inner workings, hide potentially damaging details of contracts and spending, and suppress accountability rather than inform the public. The repeated declaration of \"irrelevant content\" is a transparent lie, as critical strategic details, financial figures, and direct communications are systematically expunged.\n\n**2. Reckless Endorsement of Risky Platforms, Driven by Expediency:**\nThe internal deliberations regarding the use of TikTok reveal a shocking disregard for national security and public integrity, prioritizing \"reach\" and administrative convenience over well-established risks.\n*   **Ignoring Clear Warnings:** Internal \"Communications Section\" documents explicitly recommended the *removal* of TikTok from all campaign phases, citing \"potential level of risk,\" \"banned on government-owned devices,\" \"ongoing brand safety concerns in Australia and overseas,\" and the critical fact that \"this platform has not been used by any other department or agency for its campaigns.\" This was a clear, unambiguous alarm bell from within the agency.\n*   **Contradictory Advice from \"Defending Democracy Unit\":** Even the \"Defending Democracy Unit,\" tasked with combating disinformation and protecting electoral integrity, expressed significant reservations, stating they would be \"more comfortable if this was an ‘add in later if appropriate’, rather than a ‘remove if required’,\" acknowledging the \"perception risk.\" Yet, their advice was ultimately overridden.\n*   **Incompetent Justification:** Despite these grave warnings, TikTok was *retained* in the media plans and budget. The astonishing justification provided was to avoid \"headaches for budgeting/Rule 18/updates to media plans\" and the cynical logic that it's \"very easy to pull out of plans later, harder to add back!\" This reveals an appalling prioritization of bureaucratic convenience over fundamental security and democratic principles. It demonstrates a profound lack of foresight and a willingness to gamble with public trust.\n*   **Entrusting Critical Information to a Compromised Platform:** Perhaps most egregiously, the documents reveal that TikTok was specifically intended \"to educate the audience on how to vote correctly.\" This is a catastrophic error in judgment, proposing to use a platform notorious for its algorithmic amplification of misinformation and foreign influence to disseminate vital electoral instructions, especially to a vulnerable young demographic. This decision actively undermines the very democratic process it claims to support.\n\n**3. Blatant Deception of the Public:**\nThe most damning evidence of malice and a deliberate attack on public trust comes from the internal draft media response dated April 2023. It states, unequivocally, \"The AEC hasn’t run a trial referendum campaign using Tik Tok, nor is there any plan to do so.\" This statement is a direct, calculated falsehood. The internal documents prove, beyond any doubt, that TikTok was:\n    *   Actively recommended by the media agency (Universal McCann).\n    *   Explicitly \"included in referendum media plans\" for \"budgeting purposes.\"\n    *   Considered for a \"pilot\" program.\n    *   Maintained in plans despite forceful internal warnings and concerns from units tasked with protecting democracy.\n\nThis constitutes a cynical attempt to mislead the public, suppress legitimate concerns, and control the narrative surrounding highly questionable government decisions. It demonstrates a contempt for transparency and a willingness to outright deny facts, further eroding the foundation of democratic accountability.\n\nIn summary, these FOI documents expose a government agency plagued by secrecy, characterized by an alarming willingness to ignore critical security advice, and prepared to actively deceive the public to cover its tracks. The pursuit of \"reach\" through a demonstrably risky platform, against expert advice, for purely administrative convenience, culminates in a shameful exercise in obfuscation and outright deceit.\n\nProvide only the markdown formatted summary text. Do not include any conversational filler or preamble."
