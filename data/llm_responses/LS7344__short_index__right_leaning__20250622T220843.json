  "prompt": "From a right-leaning perspective, provide a concise, single-paragraph summary in markdown format of the following FOI request overview:\n\nSummary:\n\nThese FOI documents reveal a concerning expansion of government regulatory reach into the operations of a private technology company, Twitter, under the guise of electoral compliance. The Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) is seen attempting to offload its enforcement responsibilities onto Twitter, demanding the company implement content removal or blocking for non-compliant electoral communications and threatening legal action if it fails to do so.\n\nFrom a conservative perspective, this presents several significant deviations from core principles:\n\n*   **Economic Efficiency & Fiscal Responsibility:** The AEC's proposed framework effectively turns Twitter into an unpaid enforcement arm of the government. This imposes significant, uncompensated compliance costs and operational burdens on a private enterprise, diverting resources from innovation and value creation towards government-mandated content policing. It represents a subtle but impactful form of regulatory tax on the private sector, externalizing government expenses rather than transparently funding them through taxpayer dollars. This is fiscally irresponsible for the government, as it avoids direct costs by imposing them on the private sector.\n*   **Individual Liberty & Limited Government:** The most striking deviation is the threat to individual liberty and free speech. The AEC demands Twitter 'remove or block' content that lacks specific government-mandated authorization, including anonymous communications. While the stated aim is transparency—allowing voters to know who is behind a message—the mechanism chosen involves government-coerced censorship by a private platform. This is a significant overreach of government power, compelling a private entity to limit the expression of its users based on regulatory labels rather than factual accuracy (as the AEC notes, the Act 'does not regulate truth in electoral communications'). This actively undermines the principle of limited government by expanding state control over information flow and private sector operations, transforming a platform into a de facto regulatory agent.\n*   **National Security:** These documents do not directly address national security concerns; their focus is on domestic electoral compliance and transparency rather than foreign interference or cyber threats.\n\nProvide only the markdown formatted summary text. Do not include any conversational filler or preamble."
