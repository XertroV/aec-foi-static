            "text": "This internal AEC email, dated 4 December 2018, from Guy Lewis to Delyse Paliaga, clarifies the historical baseline for Indigenous electoral enrolment rates. It references the 2016-17 Indigenous Electoral Participation Program (IEPP) National Program Plan, stating that internal AEC research (based on 2011 ABS data and 2014 AEC statistics) estimated approximately 58% of Indigenous Australians were enrolled to vote, meaning 42% were \"missing.\" This figure is corroborated by a 2014 Hansard statement.\n\n**Relevance to FOI Request LS7888:**\n\nThis document is relevant as it establishes the historical context and the \"old 2014 methodology\" baseline for Indigenous enrolment rates (58% enrolled, or 42% unenrolled) that the FOI request seeks to contrast with the AEC's *new* methodology. While not detailing the new methodology itself, it provides the prior understanding of Indigenous enrolment that the new approach, with its significantly higher estimated rates (76.4% in June 2018, 76.6% in June 2019), was intended to update and improve upon."

  "prompt": "Considering this document as part of an FOI request, summarize the document and its relevance to the FOI request in markdown format. FYI the overview of the FOI request is: FOI request LS7888 sought documents from 2018-2019 concerning the Australian Electoral Commission's (AEC) new methodology for its Indigenous Electoral Participation Program (IEPP), specifically regarding its planning, implementation, outcomes, Indigenous involvement, and costs. The released documents reveal the AEC transitioned to a more direct method for estimating Indigenous electoral enrolment rates, primarily by utilising self-identified Indigeneity data from Centrelink. This shift, driven by the availability of new Centrelink data, significantly increased estimated Indigenous enrolment rates from approximately 58% (under the old 2014 methodology) to 76.4% by June 2018 and 76.6% by June 2019. The documents detail the new methodology, its impact, and efforts to track enrolment stimulation, including identifying over 72,000 potentially unenrolled Indigenous Australians in mid-2018 and subsequent enrolment events. However, the released content did not explicitly detail the number of Indigenous people involved in the methodology's development or its final costs and dedicated AEC staffing.\n\nDocument Text:\n\n\n\n--- Page 1 ---\n\nOwen Jones\n\nFrom:\nSent:\nTo:\nCc:\nSubject:\n\nGuy Lewis\nTuesday, 4 December 2018 1:32 PM\nDelyse Paliaga\nMichael Roden; Stephanie Maxwell\nIndigenous missing [SEC=UNCLASSIFIED]\n\nDelyse, just a note the 42% Indigenous missing. The Indigenous Electoral Participation Program 2016‐17 National \nProgram Plan, 22 August 2016 (page 4) states that internal AEC research suggests around 58 per cent are enrolled to \nvote, \non enrolment (2011) \nand AEC participation statistics in June 2014. \n\n. This data was sourced from Internal agency research \nconducted by SRA based on ABS Indigenous population data \n\nThis aligns with the Snowden statement in Hansard ‘In addition, in 2014 the AEC had already identified that 42% of \nIndigenous people were not enrolled to vote’. \n\nRegards \n\nGuy Lewis | Asst.
