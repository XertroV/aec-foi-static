Isabella McCormick, an AEC Digital & Social Media Officer, informs Louise Parrott, a Principal Government Lawyer, that two Facebook pages associated with Mr. Laming (\"Thornlands 4164\" and \"Redland Hospital: Let's fight for fair funding\") have been removed and their URLs are no longer active. McCormick suggests Parrott contact Facebook to retrieve data from these removed pages using provided links and post timestamps. The email also confirms that another page, \"Redlands Institute,\" remains active, providing multiple direct links to posts on that page. Both McCormick and Parrott emphasize the importance of taking screenshots of active pages and their bios, as content can change, with Parrott specifically requesting screenshots of active bio pages from Justin Sowden.\n\n### Relevance to FOI Request\n\nThis document is highly relevant to the FOI request as it provides direct evidence of the AEC's active investigation into Andrew Laming MP's Facebook pages for compliance with electoral authorisation laws. It illustrates the practical steps taken by AEC staff to:\n*   **Track the status of alleged unauthorised pages:** Confirming which pages have been removed and which remain active.\n*   **Gather evidence:** Highlighting the AEC's intent to obtain historical data from removed pages (via Facebook) and to document current content of active pages (via screenshots).\n*   **Internal communication and coordination:** Showing collaboration between the AEC's digital media and legal teams in prosecuting the investigation.\n\nThe document directly addresses the FOI request's overview, which mentions the AEC's efforts to identify and monitor Laming's pages, contact third parties like Facebook for data, and observe changes in page status (e.g., removal or updates)."

  "prompt": "Considering this document as part of an FOI request, summarize the document and its relevance to the FOI request in markdown format. Provide only the markdown formatted summary text. Do not include any conversational filler or preamble.To aid you, the overview of the FOI request is: [REQUEST OVERVIEW START] The FOI request disclosed documents detailing the Australian Electoral Commission's (AEC) investigation into Andrew Laming MP's Facebook pages for compliance with federal electoral authorisation laws. This inquiry was triggered by public complaints and media reports, notably from *The Guardian*, alleging Laming used numerous pages (e.g., \"Redland Bay Bulletin,\" \"Redlands Institute\") disguised as community or news groups to promote political content and attack opponents without mandatory disclosures. The AEC confirmed an active investigation, noting 2018 Electoral Act amendments broadened social media authorisation, and issued formal notices to Laming for detailed information and to third parties (like Facebook) for data, with Facebook confirming its cooperation. Findings revealed some pages were removed or updated with authorisation, while others remained active and unauthorised.\n [REQUEST OVERVIEW END] \n\n--- MAIN DOCUMENT TEXT START ---\n\n\n\n--- Page 1 ---\n\nAEC.0002.0001.1449\n\nFrom:                                 Louise ParrottSent:                                  Thu, 8 Apr 2021 16:10:40 +1000To:                                      Justin SowdenSubject:                             FW: Facebook pages - links [SEC=OFFICIAL:Sensitive]Hi Justin, Could you please also create screen shots of the bio pages still active?

The short URLs for each page are:  Thornlands 4164 – www.facebook.com/ThornlandsQLD Redland Hospital: Let’s fight for fair funding – www.facebook.com/RedlandHospital  We would suggest a reasonable approach here would be for you to contact Facebook, provide the above links and a list of dates and times for relevant posts to be retrieved. The other page – Redlands Institute is still live and all of the links are below: Redland Institute https://www.facebook.com/RInstit/photos/289654448560573 https://www.facebook.com/RInstit/photos/343065656552785\n\n\n--- Page 2 ---\n\nAEC.0002.0001.1450\n\n https://www.facebook.com/RInstit/photos/311386569720694 https://www.facebook.com/RInstit/photos/305907743601910 https://www.facebook.com/RInstit/posts/366292914230059 https://www.facebook.com/RInstit/posts/368025340723483 Assuming you already have but also a good idea to be taking screen shots of everything – including the page bio’s as they can change at any time.
