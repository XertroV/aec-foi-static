It describes an \"AEC Membership Testing – Realtime Report\" dated March 10, 2022, which outlines the results of a membership verification sample for VOTEFLUX.ORG. Out of a 66-person sample, 29 confirmed membership, 17 denied, 4 were neutral, and 16 were non-contactable.\n\nThe document is highly relevant to the FOI request as it directly addresses the AEC's methodology for verifying political party membership and provides concrete data from a specific case (VOTEFLUX.ORG), illustrating the application and outcome of these verification processes. It offers insight into how the AEC assesses compliance with the 1500-member requirement for party registration."
