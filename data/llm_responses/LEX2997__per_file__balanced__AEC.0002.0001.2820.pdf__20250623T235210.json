Prompted by public complaints and media reports, notably from *The Guardian*, the inquiry investigated allegations that Laming used numerous pages (e.g., \"Redland Bay Bulletin,\" \"Redlands Institute\") disguised as community or news groups to promote political content and attack opponents without mandatory disclosures. The AEC confirmed an active investigation, applying broadened 2018 Electoral Act social media authorisation provisions, and issued formal information requests to Laming and third parties, including Facebook, which cooperated. Findings indicated that some pages were subsequently removed or updated with authorisation, while others remained active and unauthorised.\n\nThis document is directly relevant to the FOI request as it constitutes the information disclosed regarding the AEC's investigation into Andrew Laming MP's social media activities and their adherence to federal electoral authorisation laws. It outlines the specifics of the inquiry, including the triggers, the AEC's actions, and the findings related to the alleged non-compliance."
