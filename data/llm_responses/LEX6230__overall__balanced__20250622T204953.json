            "text": "## FOI Request Summary\n\nThis FOI request pertains to the planning, cost estimates, and financial communications related to an advertising or public information campaign.\n\n### Documents from the FOI Request\n\nThe released documents consist primarily of email communications and their associated attachments, dating from May to July 2024. These documents are detailed in an accompanying schedule. Many of the documents have been either refused in full or released in part, with exemptions applied under sections such as S47(1)(b) (personal information or commercial-in-confidence), S47F (business affairs/commercial-in-confidence), S22 (irrelevant information or redactions), and S47E (deliberative processes).\n\n### Main Content from the FOI Request Documents\n\nThe core content of the released emails reveals discussions between an advertising agency (BMF) and the government body, focusing on:\n\n*   **Formalization of Cost Estimates:**\n    *   BMF sought formal approval for initial cost estimates for an \"un-dated phase\" of the campaign.\n    *   These initial estimates included retainer fees for account management, planning, and creative services, as well as costs for digital display, content & social media, and Adbank services.\n    *   Costs for Television Commercial (TVC) production were explicitly noted as pending formalization until the authorization message for the TVC was confirmed.\n*   **Financial Administration and Payment Terms:**\n    *   Communications address practical financial matters, such as confirming the appropriate recipient for invoices due to staff changes within the government body.\n    *   Discussions included the confirmation of suggested payment terms for various project quotes, with an emphasis on aligning with existing contract terms, particularly with the End of Financial Year (EOFY) in mind.\n    *   An \"updated finance tracker\" was referenced and attached, while a previously shared Out-Of-Home (OOH) & Print price quote was retracted as not yet formalized.\n*   **Campaign Planning and Media Queries:**\n    *   Detailed queries were raised by BMF regarding media recommendations and asset requirements for the campaign. These queries highlight specific production considerations and strategic decisions, including:\n        *   Whether a media buy would occur for the \"Brand phase\" and the feasibility of fitting the current script into a 30-second TVC (suggesting alternative formats like 30-second awareness or 2x15-second completion videos).\n        *   Questions about production costs for new TVC edits.\n        *   Recommendations for retaining 60-second formats for cinema advertising.\n        *   Requests for clarity on integrated partnerships and the need to account for new asset creation if required.\n        *   Specific questions about social media formats, including horizontal META formats for platforms like WeChat and Weibo, the strategic rationale behind using only 15-second social video assets versus 6-second or 10-second formats, and whether static social assets would be provided.\n        *   Inquiries about the need for two versions of Formality OOH (with and without QR codes).\n        *   Confirmation on whether UM (likely a media agency) would produce live read pointers and handicapped radio assets.\n    *   The documents mention \"ballot papers\" and reference activities from \"last election,\" indicating the campaign is likely related to public awareness or an electoral event.\n*   **Meeting and Communication Protocols:**\n    *   The emails also show an effort to establish regular communication, including proposals for weekly Work In Progress (WIP) meetings to discuss campaign progress and address queries."

We created a 30” TVC last election \n  30” formality: As mentioned on the call we couldn’t fit the current script into this length. We could look at a 30” that raises awareness of the two ballot papers, and \n\nthen use either one 30” or 2 x 15” on how to complete. \n\no  We have not allowed for production costs to create a new TVC edit either. \n\n  Cinema formality – we would recommended keeping the 60” here given it is an option \n  Can we have some more clarity around the integrate partnerships and what assets we will need to provide/create for those? \n\no \n\nIf they are new, we haven’t allowed for those in the current estimates \n\n  Can we confirm what the horizontal META formats are or are they only for WeChat and Weibo? \n\no  Also, are we reading the plan correctly and are we only going to be creating 15” social video assets? If so, what is the strategic thinking behind not \n\nproducing 6” and 10”? \n\no  To confirm as well, are we not providing social static assets for social? \n  Will we need two versions of the Formality OOH again – with and without the QR code? \n  Will UM be producing the live read pointers and the handicapped radio assets again? \n\nAlso attached is the updated asset delivery timeline which we touched on in our last regroup. Let us know if you have any queries on that. \n\nWould also be great to start our WIPs from next week too if you are available?  \n\nI believe we said Tuesday originally but would Wednesday 5th June between 9:30 and 12pm work for you then we can lock them in weekly ongoing. \n\nCheers, \n\nAccount Director (She/Her) \n\nBMF.COM.AU \n\nGadigal Country  \nLevel 2, 100 Harris Street  \nPyrmont, NSW 2009 Australia \n\n2023 Award for Culture & Bravery—B&T  \n2022 Creative & Agency of the Year—AdNews \n2022 Branding, Design & CX Agency of the Year—B&T \n2021 Australia’s Most Effective Agency—WARC \n2021 NSW Agency of the Year—B&T \n2020 APAC & Australia Effectiveness Grand Prix—Effies \n2020 Agency of the Year & Culture Award—Mumbrella \n2019 Agency of the Year—Effies & Campaign Brief \n2019 NSW, Advertising & Agency of the Year—B&T   \n\nWe acknowledge the traditional custodians of the land on which we work, the Gadigal people of the Eora nation, and pay our respects to their Elders past, present and future. \n\nFrom: \nDate: Wednesday, 29 May 2024 at 1:30 PM \nTo: \nCc: \nSubject: Re: For action: UM Village meeting follow up [SEC=UNOFFICIAL] \n\nHi \n\nThank you for sending this through. \n\n2\n\ns 47Fs 47Fs 47Fs 47Fs 47Fs 47Fs 47Fs 47Fs 47Fs 47Fs 47(F)s 47Es 47E\n\n\n--- Page 3 ---\n\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 1 ---\n\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 1 ---\n\nFrom: \nSent: Monday, June 24, 2024 6:30 PM \nTo: \nCc: \nSubject: Un-dated Phase Formal Cost estimates \n\nCAUTION: This email originated from outside of the Australian Federal Government.
