            "text": "This document is a \"SCHEDULE OF RELEASED DOCUMENTS\" detailing items provided in response to FOI request LS7888, covering the period from January 2018 to December 2019. It lists 40 documents, predominantly internal emails and papers, with many entries noting that they are \"Subsumed\" in other, larger documents, suggesting a consolidation of related communications. The listed documents include emails between various AEC staff (e.g., Guy Lewis, Michael Roden, Angelo Rojas, Delyse Paliaga, Robyn Legg, Jeff Pope, Tita Tabije) and internal papers and submissions. Key themes in the document descriptions are \"Indigenous data,\" \"Indigenous enrolment,\" \"Indigenous Franchise KPIs using Centrelink data,\" \"Indigenous population statistics,\" and \"Analysis of Indigenous Enrolment.\"\n\n**Relevance to FOI Request LS7888:**\n\nThe schedule directly addresses several aspects of FOI request LS7888, which sought information on the AEC's new Indigenous Electoral Participation Program (IEPP) methodology, specifically its planning, implementation, outcomes, Indigenous involvement, and costs:\n\n*   **Planning for the new methodology (Request Point 1):** The schedule includes early emails (e.g., March 2018) and a \"Minute re Using DHS Indigeneity data to enhance Indigenous enrolment\" (July 2018), along with early undated papers on \"Indigenous Franchise KPIs using Centrelink data.\" These items provide evidence of the initial planning and the catalyst (use of Centrelink/DHS data) for the new methodology.\n*   **Progress reports (Request Point 2):** Numerous emails exchanged between AEC staff throughout 2018 and 2019 concerning \"Indigenous data,\" \"Indigenous enrolment rates,\" and \"Indigenous population statistics\" serve as internal progress communications regarding the design, testing, and implementation of the new methodology.\n*   **Tracking implementation and comparisons of results (Request Point 3):** The frequent mentions of \"Paper titled Indigenous Franchise KPIs using Centrelink data\" and \"Paper titled Analysis of Indigenous Enrolment\" indicate the AEC's efforts to track the implementation and assess the new methodology's impact. The FOI overview notes that the released documents detail the new methodology and its impact, confirming this aspect.\n*   **Final summary reports relating to outcomes (Request Point 4):** A \"Ministerial Submission from Tom Rogers, Electoral Commissioner, AEC to Alex Hawke, Special Minister of State re Publication of Indigenous enrolment rates\" (February 2019) and \"Estimates Brief – Hot Issue\" documents (February and October 2019) are listed, which would likely contain summaries of the methodology's outcomes.\n*   **Number of Indigenous people involved (Request Point 5) & Final cost and staffing (Request Point 6):** Crucially, the schedule does *not* list any documents that explicitly detail the number of Indigenous people involved in the methodology's development or the final costs and dedicated AEC staffing for the project. This aligns with the overview of the FOI request, which stated that these specific details were not explicitly covered in the released content. The documents listed are primarily related to data analysis, internal reporting, and communication, rather than project management costs or specific Indigenous consultations/involvement numbers."

  "prompt": "Considering this document as part of an FOI request, summarize the document and its relevance to the FOI request in markdown format. FYI the overview of the FOI request is: FOI request LS7888 sought documents from 2018-2019 concerning the Australian Electoral Commission's (AEC) new methodology for its Indigenous Electoral Participation Program (IEPP), specifically regarding its planning, implementation, outcomes, Indigenous involvement, and costs. The released documents reveal the AEC transitioned to a more direct method for estimating Indigenous electoral enrolment rates, primarily by utilising self-identified Indigeneity data from Centrelink. This shift, driven by the availability of new Centrelink data, significantly increased estimated Indigenous enrolment rates from approximately 58% (under the old 2014 methodology) to 76.4% by June 2018 and 76.6% by June 2019. The documents detail the new methodology, its impact, and efforts to track enrolment stimulation, including identifying over 72,000 potentially unenrolled Indigenous Australians in mid-2018 and subsequent enrolment events. However, the released content did not explicitly detail the number of Indigenous people involved in the methodology's development or its final costs and dedicated AEC staffing.\n\nDocument Text:\n\n\n\n--- Page 1 ---\n\nRequest for: \n\ndocuments relating to the design, testing and implementation of the AEC's new methodology during 2018 & 2019 for its Indigenous Electoral \nParticipation Program (IEPP), namely: \n\n1. \n\n2. \n\n3. \n\n4. \n\n5. \n\n6. \n\nCopies of documentations from 1 Jan 2018-31 Dec 2019 (inclusive) outlining planning for the new methodology. This should include any \ndocuments relating to the nature of catalyst for the new methodology starting to be planned (e.g. instructions from relevant Ministers to \nundertake a new methodology); \n\nCopies of any progress reports filed between 1 Jan 2018-31 Dec 2019 (inclusive) about the progress of the design, testing and \nimplementation of the new methodology—this can include internal emails between staffers if necessary; \n\nCopies of documentation from 1 Jan 2018-31 Dec 2019 (inclusive) outlining how implementation of the new methodology was tracked by the \nAEC, including any comparisons of results conducted with prior methodologies for assessing Indigenous enrolment rates; \n\nCopies of final summary reports relating to the outcomes of the new methodology from 1 Jan 2018-31 Dec 2019 (inclusive);  \n\nDocumentation from 1 Jan 2018-31 Dec 2019 (inclusive) outlining the number of Indigenous people involved by the AEC in the planning, \ndesign and implementation of the new methodology; and \n\nDocumentation from 1 Jan 2018-31 Dec 2019 (inclusive) outlining the final cost of the design, testing and implementation of the new \nmethodology—this should also include details of the number of AEC staffers assigned to the task. \n\nFOI REQUEST LS7888 \n\nSCHEDULE OF RELEASED DOCUMENTS \n\nDocument \nNo. \n\nDescription \n\nEmail from Guy Lewis, Assistant Director,
