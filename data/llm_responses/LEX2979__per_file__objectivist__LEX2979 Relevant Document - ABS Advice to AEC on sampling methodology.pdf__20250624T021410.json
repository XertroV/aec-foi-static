            "text": "The Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) advice to the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) details a proposed sampling methodology for assuring the accuracy of Australian Senate ballots. The core recommendation is a refined, state-specific sampling rate (e.g., 1 in 3,000 in NSW, 1 in 120 in NT), aiming to manually check approximately 9,895 ballots nationally. This process involves two stages of testing: matching scanned images to physical ballots, and matching scanned images to extracted data files. The methodology is designed to provide 99% confidence that the observed error rate in each state's sample will be less than 1%, assuming a national error rate of 0.45% as observed in 2019. Key improvements over the 2019 approach include achieving higher confidence in the national error rate with *fewer* ballots, and enabling ballot assurance to occur concurrently with processing, enhancing efficiency. The document also details the practical implementation through clustered sampling of ballot bundles and explains how to calculate the national error rate from varying state samples.\n\nFrom an Objectivist perspective, this document, as highlighted by the FOI request overview, largely *reflects* and *aligns* with the values of reason, individualism, and free enterprise, rather than contradicting them.\n\n**Reason:**\nThe document is a prime example of applied reason. It employs precise statistical methodologies, objective data (2019 error rates, estimated ballot counts), and quantifiable confidence levels to achieve a specific, verifiable goal: ensuring the accuracy and integrity of election results. The entire framework—from determining optimal sample sizes to calculating confidence intervals and outlining practical, efficient implementation strategies (like assuring while processing and using clustered sampling)—demonstrates a commitment to rational, fact-based decision-making. The \"conservative approach\" and \"round numbers\" for simplifying implementation also show practical rationality in seeking robustness and ease of use. The goal is to establish objective truth regarding electoral accuracy.\n\n**Individualism:**\nThe FOI request overview correctly identifies this function as directly upholding the individual's right to vote. By ensuring the accuracy and integrity of election results through verifiable statistical methodologies, the ABS advice safeguards the fundamental aspect of personal freedom and political agency: knowing one's vote is counted accurately and reliably. This protects the individual's ability to participate effectively in the political process, ensuring that collective outcomes are an honest reflection of individual choices. It is a technical function that facilitates, rather than impedes, individual action within a crucial societal institution.\n\n**Free Enterprise:**\nWhile not directly related to business transactions, the principles evident in the document resonate with values supporting free enterprise. The ABS provides specialized expertise, an intellectual form of productive achievement, to enhance the efficiency and reliability of a critical public service. The focus on \"higher confidence in the national error rate, while requiring fewer ballots\" and enabling \"assurance to be undertaken while processing\" exemplifies a commitment to efficiency, resource management, and delivering a higher-quality \"product\" (electoral integrity). A stable, fact-based electoral framework, secured by objective truth, is vital for maintaining societal confidence, which in turn underpins personal prosperity and independent economic action, as it contributes to the stable rule of law necessary for a functioning market.\n\n**Evidence of Bureaucratic Obstacles, Forced Altruism, or Suppression of Productive Achievement:**\nThere is *no evidence* of bureaucratic obstacles, forced altruism, or suppression of productive achievement within this document.\n*   **Bureaucratic Obstacles:** The document presents a collaborative and logical process between two government agencies, focused on *improving* efficiency and confidence. It highlights *solutions* to logistical challenges (e.g., clustered sampling for efficiency), not obstacles.\n*   **Forced Altruism:** The document's purpose is to ensure the objective integrity of an electoral process that benefits all individuals by upholding their right to vote, not to compel individuals to sacrifice their interests for the sake of others. It protects a common good that serves individual rational self-interest in a stable society.\n*   **Suppression of Productive Achievement:** On the contrary, the document *exemplifies* productive achievement. It represents the application of specialized statistical knowledge and rational problem-solving to enhance a vital societal function, delivering higher confidence and greater efficiency in electoral outcomes. It is a technical, expert-driven improvement to a critical system."

The number of \nballots that are manually checked for errors should be sufficient to demonstrate with a high level \nof confidence that the possible national error rate is low. \n\nThe ABS recommends that Senate ballots should be assured at the following rate: \n\n•  1 in 3,000 ballots in New South Wales and Victoria; \n•  1 in 2,500 ballots in Queensland; \n•  1 in 1,250 ballots in Western Australia; \n•  1 in 1,000 ballots in South Australia; \n•  1 in 350 ballots in Tasmania; \n•  1 in 300 ballots in Australian Capital Territory; \n•  1 in 120 ballots in Northern Territory. \n\nBased on these rates, it is estimated that 9,895 ballots will be assured nationally for the 2021/22 \nSenate election. A state breakdown is provided in Table 1: \n\nThis assurance approach will provide a high level of confidence in confirming that the national \nerror rate and error rates in each of the states and territories is low. \n\nIn comparison with the internal AEC assurance approach implemented in 2019, the proposed \nallocation delivers a higher confidence in the national error rate, while requiring fewer ballots to \nbe assured. The proposed approach also allows ballot assurance to be undertaken while \nprocessing. This is helpful to speed up the assurance. \n\nBackground \n\nThe Senate assurance process implements two stages of ballot testing. The first stage of testing \nchecks that the scanned image matches the physical ballot paper. The second stage checks that \nthe scanned image of the ballot paper matches the extracted data file, i.e. that the preferences \nfrom the scanned image match the datafile that is used to run the preference allocation process. \n\nAn assurance of the 2019 Senate election found no errors during the first stage at ballot testing. \nThe national estimate of the proportion of errors during the second stage of ballot testing is \n0.45%. The calculation of the national error rate is discussed here. \n\n1\n\n\n--- Page 2 ---\n\nThe emphasis of this report is to determine an appropriate allocation to assurance for stage 2 \nerrors. Given that no stage 1 errors were detected as part of the 2019 assurance from a sample \nof 1,368, it is evident that the true stage 1 error rate is very low. For the purposes of stage 1 \ntesting, it should be sufficient to assurance 1 in 10 of the ballots selected for stage 2 testing. The \npractical implementation is discussed here. \n\nRecommended Allocation \n\nThis section details the recommended allocation and diagnostics associated with it \nAlternate allocations were considered and informed the final recommended allocation. See \nAppendix. \n\nThe allocation utilised the following assumptions. \n\n•  While the 2019 assurance indicated that the prevalence of stage 2 errors differed by \nstate, the difference between the state and national proportion of errors was not \nstatistically significant, with the exception of the ACT, which had no errors detected.1 \nTherefore, the calculated national stage 2 error rate of 0.45% was assumed in each \nstate.  \n\n•  An estimate of 16.095 million Senate forms nationally for the 2021/22 election. The \n\ndistribution of form by state as provided by the AEC – see Table A1. \n\nThe main criterion implemented for designing the target number of ballots to assurance by state \nwas to have 99% confidence that the observed error rate in the sample for each state will be less \nthan 1%, assuming that an error rate of 0.45% (as estimated in 2019) applies for the full \npopulation of senate votes. \n\nThe minimum sample size to achieve this is to select 828 ballots in each state and territory – see \nAppendix for details. \n\nThe recommended allocation places sample beyond this minimum value into each state. This is \na conservative approach to ensure we have enough sample to meet the accuracy targets, and it \nproduces round numbers for the sampling skips to be used, simplifying the implementation of this \nproposal.  It also helps to ensure robustness. The sample allocation will remain statistically valid \nif the actual number of Senate ballots in a particular state or the error rate differs slightly from \nwhat has been assumed.  \n\nTable 1: Number of ballots to assure for stage 2 error by state \n\n State \n\nEstimated \nForms 2021/22 \n\nEstimated \nBallots assured \n(stage 2) \n\nAssurance \nRate (1 in X \nballots) \n\n95% confidence \nlimit for maximum \nerror rate \n\n99% confidence \nlimit for maximum \nerror rate \n\nNSW \n\n5,200,000 \n\nVIC \n\nQLD \n\nSA \n\nWA \n\n4,130,000 \n\n3,180,000 \n\n1,200,000 \n\n1,590,000 \n\n1,733 \n\n1,377 \n\n1,272 \n\n1,200 \n\n1,272 \n\n3,000 \n\n3,000 \n\n2,500 \n\n1,000 \n\n1,250 \n\n2 \n\n0.72% \n\n0.75% \n\n0.77% \n\n0.77% \n\n0.77% \n\n0.83% \n\n0.88% \n\n0.89% \n\n0.91% \n\n0.89% \n\n1 The 2019 assurance found zero errors in ACT, during stage 2 testing.  Consequently, there is over 95% \nconfidence that the true ACT stage 2 error rate is less than the national stage 2 error rate. The national second \nstage error rate is applied to ACT in the interests of simplicity and to ensure that ACT is not under-allocated.\n\n\n--- Page 3 ---\n\nTAS \n\nNT \n\nACT \n\nAUS \n\n387,000 \n\n115,000 \n\n293,000 \n\n1,106 \n\n958 \n\n977 \n\n350 \n\n120 \n\n300 \n\n16,095,000 \n\n9,895 \n\n0.79% \n\n0.81% \n\n0.81% \n\n0.59% \n\n0.92% \n\n0.96% \n\n0.95% \n\n0.65% \n\nTesting conclusions \n\nBased on the observed error rates from the 2019 assurance and the sample sizes in each state \nthe following statistical statements could be made. \n\n• \n\nIf there is a 0.45% error rate found in the assurance sample, then the AEC can be 95% \nconfident that nationally, there are less than 6 errors per 1,000 ballot papers in the \nSenate scanning process.  It is also true that if the true error rate in the population is \n0.45%, then the AEC can be 95% confident that the error rate estimated from the \nassurance sample will be less than 6 errors per 1,000 ballot papers. \n\n•  Similarly, there is 99% confidence that nationally there are less than 6.5 errors per 1,000 \n\n• \n\nballot papers. \nIn any given state, there is 99% confidence that there are less than 10 errors per 1,000 \nballot papers. \n\nThese statistical statements are illustrative only. They are based on the assumption of a true \nerror rate of 0.45% in the population to give confidence on the size of the estimated error rate \nfrom the sample; or similarly on the assumption of an error rate of 0.45% in the assurance \nsample to give confidence in what the error rate is for the full population.  Final confidence \nintervals will depend on the actual error rates found during the 2021/22 assurance. \n\nComparison with 2019 assurance approach \n\nIt is instructive to compare the proposed assurance approach with the assurance approach \npreviously implemented in 2019. \n\nFirst, it is noted that the total expected number of ballots to assurance (9,895) is slightly lower \nthan in 2019 (10,400).  \n\nSecondly, rather than assuring a constant number of ballots in each state, the proposed \nallocation is assurances of more ballots in the more populous states and less ballots in the less \npopulous states.  \n\nIncreasing the number of ballots assured in the more populous states allows the proposed \nallocation to deliver a higher confidence in the national error rate, while assuring a smaller \nnumber of ballots. \n\nThird, it is specified to assure at a constant rate in each state, rather than a fixed total number of \nballots. This is efficient to allow ballots to be assured while processing is ongoing, rather than \nhaving to wait for all ballots to be processed before commencing assurance. \n\n3\n\n\n--- Page 4 ---\n\nPractical implementation of assuring \n\nThe AEC arranges senate ballots into bundles of 50. From a logistical perspective, it would be \nmore efficient to first select a number of bundles and then select more than one ballot from each \nbundle. \n\nFurthermore, selecting bundles at a constant rate allows assurance to be undertaken while \nprocessing is ongoing – as it will not be necessary to have every bundle processed for assurance \nto commence. \n\nThis is known as clustered sampling of the ballots.  Clustered samples can lead to lower \naccuracy if errors can also be clustered together, i.e. if errors are not evenly spread across all \nbundles.  We have suggested an approach that we believe balances the risk to accuracy from \nusing a clustered sample with the benefits that it provides, i.e. reducing the number of bundles \nthat need to be selected for the assurance sample.  The allocations provided in Table 1 have \nalready allowed for some ‘slack’ by selecting more ballots than strictly necessary to obtain a \nprecise national estimate of the stage 2 error. \n\nWe propose the assurance selects a certain proportion of ‘bundles’ (e.g. 1 in every 300 bundles \nin NSW) and then to select 1/10 of all ballots in the bundle for stage 2 testing (so that overall 1 in \nevery 3,000 ballots is selected in NSW). \n\nOnce ballots have been selected for stage 2 testing, select 1 in every 10 of the stage 2 sample \nfor stage 1 testing.  \n\nIf the sampling rate from Table 1 is adopted, then the process is described below in Table 2. \n\nTable 2: Number of forms to assure by state \n\n State \n\nEstimated \nForms \n2021/22 \n\nEstimated \nBundles \n2021/22 \n\nNSW \n\n5,200,000 \n\n104,000 \n\n4,130,000 \n\n82,600 \n\n3,180,000 \n\n63,600 \n\n1,200,000 \n\n24,000 \n\n1,590,000 \n\n31,800 \n\n387,000 \n\n115,000 \n\n293,000 \n\n7,740 \n\n2,300 \n\n5,860 \n\nVIC \n\nQLD \n\nSA \n\nWA \n\nTAS \n\nNT \n\nACT \n\nAUS \n\nAssurance \nRate  \n(1 in X \nbundles) \n\nEstimated \nBundles \nselected \n\nEstimated \nBallots \nassured  \n(stage 2) \n\nAssurance \nRate  \n(1 in X \nballots) \n\nEstimated \nBallots \nassured \n(stage 1) \n\n300 \n\n300 \n\n250 \n\n100 \n\n125 \n\n35 \n\n12 \n\n30 \n\n347 \n\n275 \n\n254 \n\n240 \n\n254 \n\n221 \n\n192 \n\n195 \n\n1,733 \n\n1,377 \n\n1,272 \n\n1,200 \n\n1,272 \n\n1,106 \n\n958 \n\n977 \n\n9,895 \n\n3,000 \n\n3,000 \n\n2,500 \n\n1,000 \n\n1,250 \n\n350 \n\n120 \n\n300 \n\n173 \n\n138 \n\n127 \n\n120 \n\n127 \n\n111 \n\n96 \n\n98 \n\n989 \n\n16,095,000 \n\n321,900 \n\n1,979 \n\n4\n\n\n--- Page 5 ---\n\nCalculating the national error rate \n\nIf an assurance approach uses a different sampling rate in different states, then in order to \ncalculate the national error rate, it is  important to weight the number of errors found in each state \nby the state’s proportion of the national population. \n\nTable 3: 2019 assurance calculation of national error rate \n\nTotal Senate \nballots 2019  \n(formal + informal) \n\nProportion of \nnational total \n\nStage 2 \nerrors \n2019 \n\nStage 2 \nsample \n2019 \n\nError \nrate \n\nEstimated \ntotal errors \n\n4,905,472 \n\n3,896,236 \n\n2,999,372 \n\n1,134,556 \n\n1,497,532 \n\n365,272 \n\n108,994 \n\n276,651 \n\n15,184,085  \n\n32.3% \n\n25.7% \n\n19.8% \n\n7.5% \n\n9.9% \n\n2.4% \n\n0.7% \n\n1.8% \n\n7 \n\n6 \n\n6 \n\n5 \n\n4 \n\n6 \n\n2 \n\n0 \n\n1,300 \n\n0.54% \n\n1,300 \n\n0.46% \n\n1,300 \n\n0.46% \n\n1,300 \n\n0.38% \n\n1,300 \n\n0.31% \n\n1,300 \n\n0.46% \n\n1,300 \n\n0.15% \n\n1,300 \n\n0.00% \n\n26,414 \n\n17,983 \n\n13,843 \n\n4,364 \n\n4,608 \n\n1,686 \n\n168 \n\n0 \n\n0.45% \n\n69,065 \n\n State \n\nNSW \n\nVIC \n\nQLD \n\nSA \n\nWA \n\nTAS \n\nNT \n\nACT \n\nAUS \n\nThe error rate in each state is estimated by dividing the number of errors in each state by the \nassurance sample size.  For example, in NSW the assurance for 7 errors from a sample of \n1,300, giving an error rate of 0.54%.  An error rate of 0.54% would mean that there is a total of \n26,414 errors from the full population of 4,905,472 votes in NSW. \n\nAfter calculating the estimated number of total errors in each state they can be added to produce \nan estimate of total number of errors in Australia.  This total is 69,065 based on the 2019 \nassurance results. \n\nDividing the estimate of 69,065 errors by the total national votes of 15,184,085 gives the \nestimated national error rate of 0.45%. \n\nAn alternate approach to calculate this national error rate is to multiply the error rate in each state \nby the proportion of votes in that state.  This gives:  \n(0.323 x 0.0054) + (0.257 x 0.0046) + (0.198 x 0.0046) + (0.075 x 0.0038) +  \n(0.099 x 0.0031) + (0.024 x 0.0046) + (0.007 x 0.0015) + (0.018 x 0)  \n= 0.0045.   \n\n5\n\n\n--- Page 6 ---\n\nAppendix \n\nTable A1: Estimated senate forms by state for 2021/2022 Senate Election – source AEC \n\nState \n\nEstimated \nSenate Forms \n\nNSW \n\nVIC \n\nQLD \n\nSA \n\nWA \n\nTAS \n\nNT \n\nACT \n\n5,200,000 \n\n4,130,000 \n\n3,180,000 \n\n1,200,000 \n\n1,590,000 \n\n387,000 \n\n115,000 \n\n293,000 \n\nTable A2: number of stage 2 errors by state – 2019 Senate assurance – source AEC \n\n State \n\nNSW \n\nVIC \n\nQLD \n\nSA \n\nWA \n\nTAS \n\nNT \n\nACT \n\nStage 2 errors \n2019 assurance \n\n2019 Error rate \n\n7 \n\n6 \n\n6 \n\n5 \n\n4 \n\n6 \n\n2 \n\n0 \n\n0.54% \n\n0.46% \n\n0.46% \n\n0.38% \n\n0.31% \n\n0.46% \n\n0.15% \n\nAlternate allocations \n\nThis section outlines various allocation options that were considered, that informed the final \nrecommended approach.

Furthermore, the estimate of the national error \nrate would be easier to interpret as no weighting would be required. \n\nThe disadvantage of applying a constant sample rate is that the smallest states would have \nrelatively few ballots assured. This would result in a less confidence in the estimate of the state \nerror rate. \n\nSample allocations \n\nTable A3 shows the national level of accuracy associated with different sample sizes, while \napplying a constant sample rate nationally. \n\nTable A3: National sample size vs 95% margin of error of estimate \n\nScenario \n\nNational \nsample size \n\n1 in \nRate \n\nOne-sided 95% \nconfidence level \n\nOne-sided 99% \nconfidence level \n\nA \n\nB \n\nC \n\n10,400 \n\n1,548 \n\n5,810 \n\n2,770 \n\n6,438 \n\n2,500 \n\n0.56% \n\n0.60% \n\n0.59% \n\n0.61% \n\n0.66% \n\n0.65% \n\nScenario A represents the national sample size that was used for stage 2 testing as part of the \n2019 assurance.

This will result in wide confidence intervals for the \nstate level estimates of proportion of errors in smaller states/territories. \n\nThe following two allocations examine the number of ballots required to be assured in each state \nin order to be 95% or 99% confident that the true state level error rate would be less than 1%  \n\nTable A5 : state assurance size required to be 95/99% confident that the true error rate < 1% \n\nState one-sided confidence \ninterval \n\nState sample \n\nNational 95% confidence \ninterval bound \n\nNational 99% confidence \ninterval bound \n\n95% \n\n413 \n\n99% \n\n828 \n\n0.71% \n\n0.64% \n\n0.82% \n\n0.71% \n\nTherefore, the state allocation to be 99% confident that the observed error rate is less than 1% in \neach state (assuming a 0.45% error rate in the population) is as in Table A6. \n\nTable A6 : State sample size and rate to be 99% confident that the assurance error rate is less than 1% \n\n State \n\nEstimated \nForms \n2021/22 \n\n State \nsample \n\nState \nsample rate \n(1 in X) \n\nNSW \n\n5,200,000 \n\nVIC \n\nQLD \n\nSA \n\nWA \n\nTAS \n\nNT \n\nACT \n\n4,130,000 \n\n3,180,000 \n\n1,200,000 \n\n1,590,000 \n\n387,000 \n\n115,000 \n\n293,000 \n\n828 \n\n828 \n\n828 \n\n828 \n\n828 \n\n828 \n\n828 \n\n828 \n\n6,280 \n\n4,988 \n\n3,841 \n\n1,449 \n\n1,920 \n\n467 \n\n139 \n\n354 \n\nTable A6 was used as the basis behind the recommended option in Table 1.

In the context of senate assurance, one-sided confidence limits \nare calculated for the stage 2 error rates, to determine the maximum error rate that could \npotentially occur, for the given level of confidence. \n\nMargin of Error (MoE) \n\nMargin of Error describes the distance from the population value that the assurance estimate is \nlikely to be within, for a specified given level of confidence. For instance, at the 95% confidence \nlevel, the MoE indicates that there are about 19 chances in 20 that the estimate will differ from \nthe population value (the figure obtained if all senate ballots had been assured) by less than the \nspecified MoE. Equivalently it is one chance in 20 that the difference is greater than the specified \nMoE, i.e. outside the MoE. . \n\nSignificance testing \n\nTo determine whether a difference between two survey estimates is a real difference in the \npopulations to which the estimates relate, or merely the product sampling variability, the \nstatistical significance of the difference can be tested. The test is performed by calculating the \nstandard error of the difference between two estimates and then dividing the actual difference by \nthe standard error of the difference. If the result is greater than 1.96, there are 19 chances in 20 \nthat there is a real difference in the populations to which the estimates relate.  \n\nStandard error \n\nThe square root of the variance of the sampling distribution of a statistic (square root of variance \nof state or national error rate in the context of senate assurance) \n\nVariance \n\nThe variance is the mean square deviation of the variable around the average value. It reflects \nthe dispersion of the empirical values around its mean. \n\n2 Glossary definitions have been taken from ABS publications and The OECD Glossary of Statistical Terms \n and modified to fit the context of senate assurance \n\n10\n\nProvide only the markdown formatted summary text.
