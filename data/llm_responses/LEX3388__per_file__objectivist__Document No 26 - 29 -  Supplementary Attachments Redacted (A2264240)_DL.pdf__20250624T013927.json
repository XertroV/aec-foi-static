            "text": "The provided document is an internal Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) email exchange detailing the logistical and financial implications of political party membership testing methodologies, specifically in the context of VOTEFLUX.ORG. It outlines the time and cost associated with the current \"in-house\" testing (based on a small sample size) and contrasts this with the significantly higher estimates for testing a larger, more statistically robust sample of 564 members. The document's core content expresses internal AEC concerns and \"risks\" related to increasing the sample size, notably citing that such an increase would strain current staffing, introduce management complexities, and, critically, \"create a precedent\" that would put an \"unnecessary strain on resources\" if parties were to submit even larger membership lists. It mentions a letter from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) that conditionally validates the current methodology, provided the Commission deems the required membership list size reasonable.\n\nFrom an Objectivist perspective, the document reflects a profound contradiction of reason, individualism, and free enterprise, serving as concrete evidence of bureaucratic obstacles and suppression of productive achievement, consistent with the FOI request's overview.\n\n**Reason:** The document overtly contradicts the value of reason by prioritizing administrative convenience and arbitrary adherence to an \"endorsed methodology\" over objective statistical validity. Despite the implicit acknowledgement that a larger sample size (564 members) would be more robust (\"using the existing parameters for risk of false acceptance and rejection\"), the AEC's internal discourse focuses on perceived \"risks\" and \"strain on resources\" as justifications for maintaining a less accurate, less rational testing standard. The framing of scaling to meet a legitimate need as \"mis-managing member responses,\" \"duplications,\" or challenges to \"ensuring accuracy\" does not represent rational problem-solving, but rather an evasion of the objective necessity for rigorous validation. The explicit fear of setting a \"precedent\" for accurate testing of larger lists demonstrates a bureaucratic unwillingness to face reality and adapt to the logical consequences of a party's productive success.\n\n**Individualism:** The document's content fundamentally undermines the Objectivist value of individualism. The state, whose proper function is to protect individual rights, is shown here as actively impeding the individual's right to free association and the pursuit of productive achievement. By citing the relatively minor monetary and time costs as \"unnecessary strain on resources,\" the AEC effectively declares that a political party's significant effort in accruing members is a burden on the state's budget and internal convenience. This implicitly places the individual's productive efforts and right to organize as secondary to the bureaucratic imperative for ease and minimal expenditure, thereby punishing excellence and discouraging the rational self-interest that drives individuals to build successful political movements.\n\n**Free Enterprise:** The document contradicts the principles of free enterprise, applied here to the \"market of ideas\" and political participation. Free enterprise thrives on unhindered production and voluntary exchange. VOTEFLUX's \"significant productive efforts in accruing members\" are effectively met with artificial, state-imposed barriers to validation. The AEC's concern that acknowledging and properly testing a larger membership list might \"create a precedent\" where parties submit \"10,000 or more members\" reveals a protectionist and anti-competitive stance. It views the *success* of a party in attracting a large following as a \"strain,\" rather than a legitimate outcome in a free society. This acts as a deterrent to new political entrants and productive endeavors, undermining the free market of ideas by stifling growth and innovation in the political sphere for the sake of bureaucratic tranquility.\n\n**Evidence of Bureaucratic Obstacles, Forced Altruism, or Suppression of Productive Achievement:**\n\n*   **Bureaucratic Obstacles:**\n    *   **Redaction (s 42 LPP):** The initial pages being redacted under Legal Professional Privilege immediately signal a lack of transparency and an inherent bureaucratic barrier to full understanding.\n    *   **Resistance to Scaling:** \"A list of 564 members would not be possible for the current Party Registration Team staffing arrangement to undertake without substantial changes to the team’s structure – the list is simply too large for it to be manageable.\" (Page 39-40, point 3.ii.1). This explicitly states an unwillingness to adapt or expand capacity to meet a legitimate, objectively necessary task, framing the party's success as the AEC's unmanageable burden.\n    *   **Exaggerated Risks of Accuracy:** \"This poses a number of risks including: a. Mis-managing member responses b. Duplications c. Ensuring accuracy in the membership results.\" (Page 40, point 3.ii.2). These are presented as reasons *not* to undertake more thorough testing, implying systemic fragility or an unwillingness to invest in robust processes, rather than solvable problems.\n    *   **Avoidance of Resource Allocation:** \"it is probable that the Party Registration Team would need to increase staffing numbers, or engage other areas of the AEC to assist.\" (Page 40, point 3.ii.4). This highlights an explicit bureaucratic reluctance to allocate necessary resources to uphold the integrity of the electoral process when it inconveniences existing arrangements.\n\n*   **Suppression of Productive Achievement:**\n    *   **Fear of Precedent:** \"Further concerns testing a size this large could create a precedent in which the AEC (or the Electoral Commission) will test membership lists of any size, despite there being an endorsed methodology.\" (Page 40, point 3.ii.5). This directly illustrates the AEC's desire to suppress the recognition of large membership drives by fearing the \"precedent\" that acknowledging productive effort might set. It prioritizes an arbitrary \"endorsed methodology\" over objective reality (the actual number of members accrued).\n    *   **\"Unnecessary Strain on Resources\":** \"Furthermore, if the AEC tests a list of over 4,000 members, what’s to stop a party submitting a list of 10,000 or more members? Lists of this size would put an unnecessary strain on resources and is not consistent with the endorsed methodology.\" (Page 40, point 3.ii.5). This is the clearest evidence of suppression. The AEC explicitly states that a party's *success* in accumulating large membership is an \"unnecessary strain\" on its resources and should be resisted, not because the members aren't real, but because it inconveniences the bureaucracy and deviates from its self-serving \"methodology.\" This directly disincentivizes and punishes productive achievement.\n\n*   **Forced Altruism (Indirect):** While the document doesn't demand direct sacrifice *from* VOTEFLUX *to* the AEC's benefit, the *outcome* of the AEC's stance is that VOTEFLUX's productive efforts in gathering members are discounted and hampered for the sake of the AEC's administrative convenience and budget. This forces VOTEFLUX to bear the cost (in terms of unrecognized effort and potential deregistration) for the AEC's unwillingness to uphold an objectively rational and accurate process, thereby sacrificing VOTEFLUX's earned value for the state's arbitrary \"will.\""

The AEC's use of a demonstrably flawed and irrational membership testing methodology, despite internal expert admission of its statistical invalidity, constitutes a profound disregard for objective reality and reason—foundations essential for personal freedom and a just society. By arbitrarily limiting and rejecting VOTEFLUX's significant productive efforts in accruing members, the AEC actively suppresses individual initiative and disincentivizes rational self-interest, effectively punishing excellence and forcing stagnation under the guise of bureaucratic \"convenience.\" This prioritization of administrative \"costs\" over truth and liberty exemplifies the dangers of collectivism, where the individual is sacrificed for the arbitrary will of the state, thereby stifling the free association and productive endeavors of citizens and undermining the proper role of government as a protector of rights.\n [REQUEST OVERVIEW END] \n\n--- MAIN DOCUMENT TEXT START ---\n\n\n\n--- Page 1 ---\n\ns 42 (LPP)\n\n\n--- Page 2 ---\n\ns 42 (LPP)\n\n\n--- Page 3

I’ve slightly updated our\nquestion 3 below in light of ABS response at 2(a) of their letter. As you’ll see the ABS considers that\nthe current testing methodology continues to be appropriate, provided that the Commission is\nsatisfied that it is reasonable to require a political party to provide a list of between 1,500 to 1,650\nmembers. As we noted below, the Commission has orally advised the Commission Secretariat that\nthey would also like to seek advice from the AEC, and to the extent necessary, Services Australia in\nrelation to the likely cost of various options for membership testing.  \n\nKind regards\n\n | Senior Government Lawyer\nLegal Services Section | Legal & Procurement Branch\nAustralian Electoral Commission\n\nFrom: Commission Secretariat \nSent: Tuesday, 30 August 2022 11:36 AM\nTo: \n\ns 47F (Personal Privs 47F (Personal Privacy)s 47F (Personal Privacy)s 47F (Pe s 47F (Pe s 47F (Personal Privacy)s 47F (Personal Privacy)s 47F (Personal Privacy)s 47F (Personal Privacy) 47F (Personal s 47F (Personal Privacy)s 47F (Pe s 47F (Personal Privacy)s 47F (Personal Privacy)s 47F (Personal Privacy)s 47F - Pe\n\n\n--- Page 39 ---\n\nCc: FAD <FAD@aec.gov.au>; \n\nSubject: voteflux.org - Request for advice from Party Registration Team/Services Australia (LEX1991)\n[SEC=OFFICIAL]\n\nDear \n\nOn 23 August 2022 the Electoral Commissioner wrote to Dr Gruen AO at the ABS to ask a number of\nquestions about the testing methodology currently employed by the AEC. Please see attached a copy\nof that correspondence.\n\nAs you will see, in that letter the Electoral Commission requested formal ABS advice in relation to\noptions for testing party membership. ABS have not yet responded to the letter, but the Commission\nhas orally advised the Commission Secretariat that they would also like to seek advice from the AEC,\nand to the extent necessary, Services Australia in relation to the likely cost of various options for\nmembership testing.\n\nWe understand that the AEC has an agreement with Services Australia for Services Australia to\nundertake membership testing. However, the AEC Party Registration Team also has capacity to\nundertake some membership testing ‘in-house’.\n\nWhilst that advice may depend on the response from ABS, and whilst the Commission may write with\nfurther questions, we would be grateful at this stage if you could prepare initial advice responding to\nthe following questions.\n\n1.  On the basis of the current methodology (noting the sample size would be less than 60\n\nmembers for a list of between 1500-1650 members), what is the average amount of time that\nperforming a membership test takes?\n\na.  How long does it usually take from the AEC providing instructions to undertake testing\n\nuntil a result is provided?\n                                                               i.      Approximately 2 weeks.\n\nb.  Roughly how many hours of Commonwealth employees’ time does testing take?\n\n                                                               i.      Contacting members takes approximately 6 hours.\n                                                             ii.      Data cleaning of the membership list and matching the list to the\n\nCommonwealth Electoral Roll takes approximately 15 hours.\n\n2.  What is the average cost of performing a membership test with the current methodology when\n\ntesting undertaken by Services Australia or by the AEC?\n\n                                                               i.      Current inhouse staffing arrangements would have an APS5 undertake\n\nmembership testing. An APS 5’s hourly rate is $51.54 (incl Leave, Long Service\nLeave and Superannuation). Using the assumption that it requires 21 hours\nfor end-to-end testing of the membership list, it would costs the\nCommonwealth $1,082 of a Commonwealth Employee’s time.\n\n                                                             ii.      In regards to Services Australia, my understanding is that the AEC has paid\nfor Services Australia’s services for a one year period in which any number of\nmembership lists can be tested.\n\n3.  Noting that the current methodology requires a sample size of less than 60 members, can you\n\nprovide an estimate of how long it would take and how much it would cost to test a list\nassuming a sample size of 564 members?\n\n                                                               i.      Using the same set of assumptions above, and noting to do this this in a\n\ntimely manner, 5 to 10 staff members would need to work on the list\nconcurrently, it would take:\n\ns 47F (Personal Privacy)s 47F (Personal Privacy)s 47F (Pe\n\n\n--- Page 40 ---\n\n1.  Approximately 2 to 3 weeks for end-end-testing: 56 hours to contact\n\nmembers; and 141 hours to undertake data cleaning and matching of the\nlist to the Commonwealth Electoral Roll (using 9.4 multiplier, which is the\nmultiplier I used to calculate time of testing a list of 60 vs 564). Using the\nAPS5 multiplier of $51.54 it would cost $10,153 of a Commonwealth\nEmployee’s time.\n\n                                                             ii.      There are a number of considerations and risks should the agency choose\n\nto increase the size of testing to (for example) a list of 564 members. This\nincludes:\n1.  A list of 564 members would not be possible for the current Party\n\nRegistration Team staffing arrangement to undertake without substantial\nchanges to the team’s structure – the list is simply too large for it to be\nmanageable.\n\n2.  The most efficient way to manage a list this size would be to split it\n\namongst 5 to 10 staff. This poses a number of risks including:\n\na.  Mis-managing member responses\nb.  Duplications\nc.  Ensuring accuracy in the membership results.\n\n3.  Under current arrangements, splitting a list between 5 to 10 staff would\ninvolve further engagement with Services Australia and a possible split of\nwork between AEC and Services Australia staff. In theory, by splitting the\nlist between 5 to 10 people, the membership testing could be completed\nwithin 2-3 weeks.\n\n4.  The size of such a membership list however would be a substantial increase\nin work at the first part of the process in which members are matched to\nelectors on the Commonwealth Electoral Roll (which is done by the AEC), it\nis probable that the Party Registration Team would need to increase\nstaffing numbers, or engage other areas of the AEC to assist.\n\n5.  Further concerns testing a size this large could create a precedent in which\nthe AEC (or the Electoral Commission) will test membership lists of any\nsize, despite there being an endorsed methodology. Should the Electoral\nCommission wish to test a list of that size, we may need to consider an\nentirely new membership testing methodology and ensure that the process\nis fair, robust and not providing an opportunity for deregistered parties to\nchallenge established processes. Furthermore, if the AEC tests a list of over\n4,000 members, what’s to stop a party submitting a list of 10,000 or more\nmembers? Lists of this size would put an unnecessary strain on resources\nand is not consistent with the endorsed methodology. \n\nYou will note that the third question proceeds from the assumption of testing a list of over 4,000\nmembers based on the sample size suggested by the ABS calculator using the existing parameters for\nrisk of false acceptance and rejection.\n\nThank you for your assistance.\n\n | Commission Secretariat\n\nAustralian Electoral Commission\n\ns 47F (Personal Privacy)s 47F (Personal Privacy)\n\nProvide only the markdown formatted summary text.
