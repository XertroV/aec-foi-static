This opaqueness is further compounded by the inclusion of multiple \"intentionally left blank\" pages, which points to significant bureaucratic waste, a poorly managed process, or even an intentional design to dilute limited disclosure, ultimately reflecting a system where information is tightly controlled and administrative operations appear wasteful and opaque."

  "prompt": "From a government skeptic's viewpoint, provide a concise, single-paragraph summary in markdown format of the following FOI request overview:\n\nSummary:\n\nThe provided FOI documents reveal a concerning pattern of information control and potential administrative inefficiency regarding access to the electoral roll. While the request pertains to fundamental democratic infrastructure, the government has granted only \"Access to edited copy\" for both an email and a signed deed concerning the roll, citing exemption `s 47F`. This raises immediate red flags about transparency: what critical details about who is accessing the electoral roll, for what purpose, or under what conditions are being redacted? The use of an exemption, ostensibly for personal information, could be a broad justification to obscure broader insights into data handling, potential misuse, or the terms of third-party access to this sensitive public resource.\n\nFurthermore, the physical composition of the FOI response itself points to significant administrative waste and inefficiency. Pages 2 through 8 are almost entirely blank, repeatedly stating \"This page intentionally left blank.\" This bureaucratic padding not only inflates the apparent volume of the response without providing any substantive information but also suggests a lack of streamlining within the FOI process. It implies a system that is either poorly managed, needlessly cumbersome, or perhaps intentionally designed to dilute the impact of limited disclosure by presenting a thick file of empty pages, thus raising questions about the government's commitment to lean and transparent operations. The overall picture is one of information tightly controlled and administrative processes that appear wasteful and opaque.\n\nProvide only the markdown formatted summary text. Do not include any conversational filler or preamble."
