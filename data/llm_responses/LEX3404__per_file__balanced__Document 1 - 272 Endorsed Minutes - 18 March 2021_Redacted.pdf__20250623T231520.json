            "text": "### Summary of Document and Relevance to FOI Request\n\nThis document comprises the minutes from Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) Meeting No. 272, held on March 18, 2021, falling within the FOI request's specified timeframe. The minutes detail key discussions and decisions central to the FOI's scope concerning political party registration and membership verification.\n\n**Key points from the document:**\n\n*   **Party Membership Testing Methodology:** The Commission reviewed its existing statistical sampling methodology for verifying that non-parliamentary parties meet the then-current 500-member requirement. Discussion included the methodology's history (developed 2010, updated 2011, 2017), previous advice from former Australian Statistician Mr David Kalisch regarding non-responses, and potential risks of challenges to the methodology (e.g., by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal).\n*   **Engagement with ABS for Methodology Review:** A significant outcome was the decision (Action 272.1) to engage with the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS). The purpose was to obtain updated advice on the current membership testing methodology and to explore alternative methodologies that could increase statistical confidence without unduly affecting AEC resources. This directly addresses the FOI request's focus on \"seeking Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) advice on membership testing\" and the \"evolving methodology for verifying party membership.\"\n*   **Party Registration Decision:** The Commission formally decided to affirm the delegate's refusal of registration for the \"Stop Selling Australia Party.\" This decision, made under s141 of the *Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918*, was based on the party failing to meet the minimum 500 eligible member requirement during testing, demonstrating the practical application of membership rules and the Commission's decision-making on party registration.\n\n**Relevance to FOI Request:**\n\nThis document is highly relevant as it is an endorsed set of minutes from an AEC meeting within the specified period. It directly addresses the FOI's core themes by detailing the Commission's discussions and decisions regarding:\n\n*   The evolving methodology for verifying party membership, specifically initiating engagement with the ABS to review and potentially enhance the statistical confidence of the testing process.\n*   A specific ruling on a political party's registration (\"Stop Selling Australia Party\"), including the application of membership verification rules.\n*   General discussions on party registration processes and name restrictions, underscoring the Commission's oversight role."

Do not include any conversational filler or preamble.To aid you, the overview of the FOI request is: [REQUEST OVERVIEW START] An FOI request sought minutes from Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) meetings held between March 2, 2021, and October 19, 2022, resulting in the release of seven sets of endorsed, edited minutes. These documents primarily detail the Commission's decisions and discussions concerning political party registration, deregistration, and name changes, alongside the evolving methodology for verifying party membership, particularly in response to legislative amendments increasing the minimum member requirement from 500 to 1,500. Key discussions included seeking Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) advice on membership testing, and specific rulings on party names (e.g., \"The New Liberals,\" \"Liberal Democratic Party\"), deregistration (e.g., \"Australian People’s Party,\" \"VOTEFLUX.ORG\"), and re-registration (e.g., \"Seniors United Party of Australia\").\n [REQUEST OVERVIEW END] \n\n--- MAIN DOCUMENT TEXT START ---\n\n\n\n--- Page 1 ---\n\nMinutes \n\nAustralian Electoral Commission \nMeeting No. 272 \n\nDate: Thursday 18 March 2021  Time: 11:30am  Location: Commissioner’s Boardroom, \n10 Mort Street, Canberra, ACT \n\nAttendees:  \nThe Hon. Justice Susan Kenny AM (Chair);  \nMr Tom Rogers (Electoral Commissioner);  \nDr David Gruen (Australian Statistician)   \nMs Joanne Reid (Assistant Commissioner Disclosure, Assurance, and Engagement Branch)  \nMr Andrew Johnson (Chief Legal Officer) \n\nAction Officer: \n\n (Commission Secretariat) \n\nAgenda  \n\nItem \n\n1.  Welcome and Commissioner’s introduction \n\n2.  For information: Membership testing and advice \n\n3.  For Decision: Application for review under s141 – Stop Selling Australia Party \n\n4.  Closing \n\nAgenda item 1: Welcome and Commissioner’s introduction \n\nThe Chair opened the meeting at 11:40am. Mr Tom Rogers acknowledged the traditional owners of \nthe land and welcomed the Commission members; the Hon. Justice Susan Kenny, and \nDr David Gruen. The Commission members welcomed this meeting as the first opportunity for a face-\nto-face meeting since all three members were appointed to the Commission. \n\nsection 47F\n\n\n--- Page 2 ---\n\nAgenda item 2: For information: Party membership process \n\nMs Jo Reid provided background on party registration for federal elections. \n\n•  The role of the AEC is to ensure that parties who apply for registration are compliant under \n\nthe Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 (the Electoral Act). \n\n•  Part of Ms Reid’s role as the Assistant Commissioner of Disclosure, Assurance, and \nEngagement Branch, is to act as the delegate of the Electoral Commission for party \nregistration matters under s126(3) of the Electoral Act.  \n\n•  Parties can either be parliamentary or non-parliamentary. Parliamentary parties must have \n\none Member of Parliament to register. Non-parliamentary parties must provide evidence that \nthey have at least 500 active members.  \n\n•  The AEC currently has 74 parties and state branches registered. Registered parties can have \n\ntheir party name on the ballot paper next to the name of the candidate. \n\n•  Parties are not incorporated entities and are only accountable under the Electoral Act. \nRegardless of registration, all candidates for an election must lodge a financial return. \n•  Ms Reid noted that decisions made by the delegate can be subject to further review by the \n\nCommission under s141 of the Electoral Act. \n\nMembers discussed s129 of the Electoral Act and restrictions of party names, noting the previous \ndecisions made by the AEC and the Commission. \n\nMs Reid provided Commission Members an overview of the Australian Electoral Commission’s \nmembership testing process. \n\n•  The AEC uses statistical sampling to attain confidence that a party has at least 500 members. \nThe methodology for this process was developed in March 2010, and reviewed and updated \nin 2011 and 2017.  \n\n•  To determine whether a political party meets the requirements of the Electoral Act relating to \nthe number of members, the AEC will contact a random sample of 18 to 50 members where \nthe sample size corresponds with the size of the list provided. A certain percentage of \nmembers must confirm their membership when contacted by the AEC. \n\n•  Mr Rogers noted that the review of the methodology in 2017 pertained to whether non-\n\nresponses are able to be considered as neither confirming nor denying membership. The \nadvice received from the previous Australian Statistician, Mr David Kalisch, indicated that the \noriginal membership testing considered a non-response a denial. The approach taken by the \nAEC would not disadvantage the party, in fact considering non-responses as neither \nconfirmations nor denials would be potentially advantageous for the party. \n\n•  Based on the advice of the then Australian Statistician, Mr David Kalisch, the current \n\nmethodology provides no less than a 90% confidence rate that a party has 500 members.  \n\n•  Ms Reid noted that the process has never been tested in a court. Commission members \nnoted that the process could be tested by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT). \n\nMembers discussed the process, noting the risk that the AAT would consider resourcing limitations a \nweak argument for the random sample approach. Members noted that a stronger argument would \ninvolve a high statistical confidence in the methodology, demonstrated attempts to avoid penalising \napplicants, and evidence that alternative methodologies have been investigated. \n\nMembers agreed that further investigation of the membership testing methodology should be \nundertaken. \n\nMinutes: Australian Electoral Commission Meeting No. 272 \n\nPage 2\n\n\n--- Page 3 ---\n\nAction \n\nOfficer \n\n272.1  The Australian Electoral Commission will engage with the Australian \n\nTom Rogers \n\nBureau of Statistics, regarding the membership testing methodology, to: \n\n1.  Obtain updated advice on the current methodology  \n2.  Explore whether there is an alternative methodology that \n\nincreases the statistical confidence without unduly affecting the \nresourcing of the Australian Electoral Commission \n\nMs Jo Reid excused herself from the meeting. \n\nAgenda item 3: For Decision: Application for review under s141 – Stop Selling Australia Party \n\nMembers discussed the application for review under s141 of the Electoral Act concerning the \nregistration of the Stop Selling Australia Party, as outlined by the commission paper. \n\nMembers noted the recommendation that the Commission affirms the delegate’s decision of 18 \nSeptember 2020 to refuse the application to register the Party. \n\nMembers noted that, as the membership list contains exactly eligible 500 members, a single denial \nfrom the testing of 18 members of the list results in a failure to meet the minimum required number of \neligible members. . Members reflected the discussion and resultant action item 272.1 that had \noccurred under agenda item 2. \n\nThe Commission reflected that the AEC made demonstrated and numerous attempts to remain in \ncontact with the Party.  \n\nOn this basis, the Members agreed to affirm the delegate’s decision of 18 September 2020 to refuse \nthe application to register the Party, and the additional information provided by the affected party \nunder review pursuant to section 141(4) of the Electoral Act.  \n\nAgenda item 4: Closing \n\nThe Chair closed the meeting at 12:30pm. \n\nMinutes: Australian Electoral Commission Meeting No. 272 \n\nPage 3\n\n"
