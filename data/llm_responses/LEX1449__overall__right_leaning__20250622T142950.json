            "text": "These FOI documents detail the administrative process undertaken by the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) in considering objections to the registration of \"David Pocock\" as a non-Parliamentary political party. The documents provide insight into the AEC's adherence to the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 when faced with public scrutiny and challenges to a political entity's formation.\n\n**Economic Efficiency:** The documents do not directly address economic efficiency in terms of government spending or market operations. However, the detailed administrative process for party registration, including public advertisement, managing objections, and formal responses, represents a bureaucratic overhead. From a fiscally conservative viewpoint, while necessary for procedural fairness, this process underscores the ongoing cost of regulatory oversight. The objectors' concerns about potential election challenges if the party's registration were deemed invalid highlight a potential future drain on public resources for legal disputes, suggesting that rigorous upfront adherence to rules can prevent greater fiscal burdens later.\n\n**Individual Liberty:** The core function revealed is the government's role in facilitating the right of individuals to form political associations. The AEC's decision-making, which strictly adheres to the explicit requirements of the Electoral Act and resists subjective interpretations of what constitutes a \"party,\" strongly aligns with individual liberty. By rejecting objections that sought to impose qualitative or conceptual definitions on a political party (e.g., that a single person's name cannot constitute a party), the AEC demonstrated a commitment to allowing individuals the freedom to organize politically within clear, statutory boundaries, without arbitrary bureaucratic interference.\n\n**National Security:** The objection referencing David Pocock's alleged foreign citizenship (a Section 44 issue) touches indirectly on national loyalty, a component often associated with national security. However, the documents show the AEC maintaining a clear distinction: candidate eligibility is separate from party registration. The AEC's position, that such eligibility is assessed at the point of nomination rather than party registration, exemplifies a compartmentalized and defined governmental function, avoiding mission creep into areas outside its immediate statutory remit for party registration. This narrow interpretation prevents the AEC from overstepping its boundaries into broader national security assessments.\n\n**Fiscal Responsibility:** While the documents do not detail specific expenditures, the administrative steps outlined (advertisement, objection processing, legal review) require significant public resources. The AEC's diligent process to ensure compliance with the Electoral Act, and its robust defense against objections, can be viewed as a responsible effort to prevent future, more costly legal challenges that could arise from an improperly registered party. By ensuring the process is legally sound, the AEC aims to prevent wasteful litigation and uncertainty, thereby indirectly promoting fiscal prudence.\n\n**Limited Government:** This principle is strongly affirmed by the AEC's actions. The documents clearly demonstrate the AEC's commitment to operating strictly within its statutory authority under the Commonwealth Electoral Act. The AEC explicitly declined to engage in \"qualitative evaluation of what a party should be\" or subjective assessments of a party's name beyond specific prohibitions in Section 129. This refusal to exercise discretion beyond the explicit text of the law is a hallmark of limited government, preventing bureaucratic overreach and ensuring that government actions are predictable and grounded in established legal frameworks rather than arbitrary judgment. The clear separation of responsibilities (party registration versus candidate eligibility) further reinforces the principle of a government agency operating within its precisely defined legal boundaries."

LEX1499 \n\n  Copies of all documents relating to consideration of Applicant’s objection [made in response to the AEC’s advertisement of an application made by \n\nDavid Pocock to register as a non-Parliamentary party in the Register of Political Parties]. \n\nSCHEDULE OF RETRIEVED DOCUMENTS \n\nDoc No. \n\nDescription \n\nDate \n\n  Minute: For action – Final determination of application made under s 126(1)(b) of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 \n\n18 March 2022 \n\n(Electoral Act) for registration as a non-Parliamentary party – David Pocock (the Party)\n\n\n\n--- Page 1 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 2 ---\n\nAEC authorised officer for the purposes of s 132(1) of the Electoral Act, authorised the advertisement \nof the Application in 10 newspapers nationally and on the AEC website (OBJECT ID: A1389361). \n\nOFFICIAL \n\nOn 11 February 2022, the Application was advertised on the AEC website and in 10 major \nnewspapers. A copy of the advertisement is at OBJECT ID: A1354991. The closing date for the \nsubmission of written particulars was 11 March 2022.  \n\nThe AEC received four sets of written particulars (‘objections’) during the public consideration period \nfor the Application, from three persons (‘the Objectors’).  \n\nWritten particulars submitted \n\nWritten particulars \nfrom \n\nDate received \n\nRelevant part of \nthe Electoral Act \n\nOBJECT IDs: \n\n1. \n\n2. \n\n3. \n\n4. \n\n Ernst \n\nErnst \n\n Neil \n\n Lis \n\n10 March 2022 \n\nSs 126 or 129 \n\n10 March 2022 \n\nSs 126 or 129 \n\n10 March 2022 \n\nSs 126 or 129 \n\n10 March 2022 \n\nSs 126 or 129 \n\n– original - A1428572 \n– redacted - A1428570 \n– original - A1431087 \n– redacted - A1431089 \n– original - A1428568 \n– redacted - A1428566 \n– original - A1428574 \n– redacted - A1428564 \n\nLegislative framework – written particulars \nSection 132(2)(b) of the Electoral Act provides that a person can only submit written particulars \nobjecting to an application to register a party (or a logo in the case of s 132(2)(b)(iv) of the Electoral \nAct) if the person believes that:  \n\na)  the application does not relate to an eligible political party; or \nb)  the application is not in accordance with s 126 of the Electoral Act \n(the section setting out the requisite contents of an application); or  \n\nc)  the application should be refused under s 129 of the Electoral Act (the name and \n\nabbreviation tests); or \n\nd)  the Electoral Commission should refuse to enter a logo of the party in the Register under \n\ns 129A of the Electoral Act (the logo test). \n\nFor the Application, written particulars are required to meet the following administrative requirements \nunder ss 132(2)–(3) of the Electoral Act: \n\n1.  be in writing; \n2.  be signed by the objector (either physically, or electronically as per s 10(1) of the Electronic \n\nTransactions Act 1999); \n\n3.  specify a postal address of the objector that does not consist of a post office box number \n(noting the definition of ‘address’ in s 123(1) of the Electoral Act and the postal service \nrequirements in s 140(1) of the Electoral Act); \n\n4.  be submitted within 1 month after the publication of the relevant s 132(1) Notice on the AEC \n\nwebsite; and \n\n5.  set out the objector’s belief that the Application should be refused for a reason listed in \n\ns 132(2)(b) of the Electoral Act and provide grounds in support of that belief. \n\nWritten particulars received objecting to the Application must be processed in accordance with \nss 132(4) and (5) of the Electoral Act. This requires the Electoral Commission to make the written \nparticulars available for public inspection (published on the AEC website) under s 132(4) of the \nElectoral Act, and provide a copy to the Registered Officer for an opportunity to reply under s 132(5) \nof the Electoral Act. \n\nMinute  \n\nPage 2\n\n\n--- Page 3 ---\n\nSummary of Objection one from \n\nErnst\n\nOFFICIAL \n\n‘At the time the application for registration as a political party was lodged it was clear from \ninterviews published in the media including the Canberra Times that Mr David Pocock was a \ncitizen of a foreign country, Zimbabwe, and therefore ineligible for the Senate.’ \n\n‘The AEC should not accept registration of a party named in relation to a person who is \nineligible for the Senate.’ \n\n‘To name a party with the name of a person who at the time of application for registration of \nthe party is ineligible for election is surely inappropriate.’ \n\n‘Election of a number of persons to the Parliament was overturned by the High Court. \nAmongst other things the High Court held the critical issue was eligibility at the time of \nnomination.’ \n\n‘The AEC should reject this registration application. Mr Pocock should be invited to resubmit \nthe application if and when he has become eligible for election to the Senate.’ \n\nSummary of Objection two from  Ernst \n\n‘I submit this proposed name must be rejected because the proposed name is not consistent \nwith the concept of a party. \n\nSimply put, a party is a body of persons united in some sort of cause or opinion or otherwise \nengaged together. \n\nA single person or the name of a single person cannot constitute a party. Accordingly I submit \nthe registration must be rejected. \n\nThis can be compared or contrasted with the proposed registered party logo, David Pocock \nfor the ACT. That represents a cause. So an application to register the name of a party along \nthe lines David Pocock for the ACT may well be valid. So would a name along the lines David \nPocock for the environment. Names along these lines indicate a cause or opinion or some \nsort of engagement beyond a mere name. \n\nThe AEC will appreciate that an invalid registration could have serious consequences. For \nexample if this ‘party’ was registered and placed above the line and the candidate was \nsuccessful another candidate could challenge the validity of the election. \n\nThe AEC should not countenance such obvious uncertainty which can so easily be corrected \nby a fresh application with a name that satisfies the concept of ‘party’.’ \n\nSummary of Objection from \n\n Neil \n\n: \n\n‘I object to acceptance of the proposed party name as simply “David Pocock”.’ \n\n‘Such a title is a person’s name only and not indicative of a political party and social cause. If \nthe applicant wishes only to be referred to by name, as a candidate he can appear in that way \nbelow the line on the ballot paper. If this application is successful. The same words would be \nprinted on the ballot paper above and below the line which would surely be confusing.’ \n\n‘Secondly, if media reports and suggestions are correct in that, at the time of submission of \nthe application for registration of a political party, Mr Pocock was a citizen of another country, \nsurely this renders him in eligible to submit such an application until such time as he has \nsurrendered citizenship of that other country.’ \n\nMinute  \n\nPage 3\n\n\n--- Page 4 ---\n\nSummary of Objection from \n\n Lis \n\n: \n\nOFFICIAL \n\n‘A single person or the name of a single person cannot constitute a party. The reason being: a \nparty is a body of persons united in some sort of cause or opinion or otherwise engaged \ntogether. \n\nThis can be compared or contrasted with the proposed registered party logo, David Pocock \nfor the ACT. That represents a cause. So an application to register the name of a party along \nthe lines David Pocock for the ACT may well be valid. So would a name along the lines David \nPocock for the environment. Names along these lines indicate a cause or opinion or some \nsort of engagement beyond a mere name.’ \n\n‘However, a single name on its own obviously does not constitute a party in accordance with \nthe ordinary meaning of party, hence I submit the registration must be rejected.  \n\n‘The AEC will appreciate that an invalid registration could have serious consequences. If this \n‘party’ was registered and placed above the line and the candidate were to be successful, \nthen another candidate could challenge the validity of the election. \n\nThe AEC should not countenance such obvious uncertainty which can so easily be corrected \nby a fresh application with a name that satisfies the concept of a ‘party.’ \n\nOn 16 March 2022, the Registered Officer of the Party, Mr Glenn Cummings, responded to the \nwritten particulars contained in the objections from ‘Ernst’, ‘Neil’ and ‘Lis’ (OBJECT ID: A1435232 \nand A1435234). The response was published on the AEC website in accordance with s 132(6) of the \nElectoral Act.  \n\nThe response from the Party to each of the objections is outlined below. \n\n‘In summary, our client’s view is that there has been nothing raised in the Objections which, \nunder the Act, would either (i) prevent the Electoral Commissioner from registering the Party \nor (ii) respectfully, permit the Electoral Commissioner to decline to register the Party, as a \nnon-Parliamentary party under Part XI of the Act.).’ \n\nIn relation to Objections from Ernst (2), Neil (3) and Lis (4) the Party responded that: \n\na)  none of the particulars of the Objections refer to a provision of the Act which would prevent \n\nthe registration of the Party with its proposed name;  \n\nb)  there is no requirement in the Act that a name of a party be ‘consistent with the concept of a \n\nparty’;  \n\nc)  the ground invites a qualitative evaluation of what a party should be or how it should operate \nwhich goes far beyond the requirements in the Act and in doing so asks the Commissioner to \nperform a task which it is not empowered by the Act to do;  \n\nd)  in any event, the objects and operation of the Party meet the requirements of the Act as set \nout at 6(a) such that it is entirely consistent with the concept of a party. The name is simply \nthe means by which that party is identified and there is no requirement that the name include \na specific reference to it being a ‘party’, ‘group’ or some other ‘cause based entity’ as is \nargued in the Objections. \n\nIn relation to the second Objection from Ernst the Party responded that: \n\na)  it is a speculative allegation that the outcome of the election could be challenged on the basis \nthat the Party is placed above the line and the Objections are silent as to which provision of \nthe Act could properly found such a challenge or declaration of invalidity under s 362 of the \nAct; \n\nMinute  \n\nPage 4\n\n\n--- Page 5 ---\n\nb)   again, it invites a qualitative evaluation of the effect of the name of a party, where that name \n\ndoes not contain any of the prohibited features in s 129 of the Act. \n\nOFFICIAL \n\nIn relation to Objections from Ernst (1) and Neil (3) (the Section 44 reference) the Party responded \nthat: \n\na)  the question of eligibility of a proposed endorsed candidate of a party for election is separate \n\nto the eligibility of a party to be registered as a non-Parliamentary Party; \n\nb)  the Party meets the requirements for registration as a non-Parliamentary Party and the \n\neligibility of any proposed endorsed candidates is not permitted by the Act to be undertaken in \nthe assessment of a party registration application; \n\nc)  even if it were relevant to consider the eligibility for election of a proposed candidate, the point \nat which a candidate must be eligible is the point at which they nominate for election, not the \npoint at which the party is registered. \n\n‘Based on the above, the Party submits that the Electoral Commissioner should reject the \nparticulars in the Objections and not decline to register the Party on the basis of such \nparticulars.’ \n\nConsideration of the Objections and the Response \n\nUnder ss 132A(1) and 133(3) of the Electoral Act, if the Electoral Commission refuses an application \nfor registration, the Electoral Commission must: \n\n•  publicise the reasons for the Electoral Commission’s decision; and  \n•  give written notice of those reasons to the applicant(s); and \n•  give written notice of those reasons to any person who submitted an objection under s 132(2) \n\nin relation to the application. \n\nUnder ss 133(1) and 133(1A) of the Electoral Act, if the Electoral Commission makes a determination \nthat a political party should be registered, the Electoral Commissioner must:  \n\n•  publish notice of the registration on the AEC website (and may publish the notice in any other \n\nway that the Electoral Commissioner considers appropriate); \n•  give written notice of the registration to the applicant(s); and \n•  give written notice to any person who submitted an objection under s 132(2) in relation to the \n\napplication, setting out the reasons for rejecting the person’s reasons for making their \nobjection. \n\nYou are a delegate of the Electoral Commission for the purposes of ss 132A(1), 133(1) and 133(3), \nand you are authorised to publish notice of registration under s 133(1A) of the Electoral Act. \nA copy of a draft statement of reasons (‘the Draft Statement of Reasons’) is at OBJECT ID: \nA1389673 and has been drafted on the recommendation that you make the determination that the \nParty should be registered. \n\nAlthough it would not be a legal requirement for you to publicise or provide reasons to the Applicants \nif you make the determination that the Party should be registered (as opposed to if you decide to \nrefuse the Application), the Draft Statement of Reasons has been drafted in the interests of \ntransparency and consistency.  \n\nConclusion \n\nOn 24 December 2021, the AEC received all of the procedural requirements for an application for \nregistration from the Applicants under ss 126(1)(b) and 126(2) of the Electoral Act. \n\nMinute  \n\nPage 5\n\n\n--- Page 6 ---\n\nOFFICIAL \n\nOn 4 February 2022, a delegate for the purposes of s 131 of the Electoral Act of the Electoral \nCommission determined that the Application passed the initial assessment. The delegate (also an \nauthorised officer for the purposes of s 132(1) of the Electoral Act) approved the advertisement of the \nApplication in 10 newspapers circulating generally in each State and Territory and on the AEC \nwebsite. The Application was advertised on 11 February 2022 and four sets of written particulars \nfrom three objectors, were received during the public consultation period by the closing date of 11 \nMarch 2022. \n\nAfter considering the objections and response from the Party, the AEC found there are no additional \ngrounds or information provided to give reason for the delegate to refuse the application for \nregistration.  \n\nBased on this information, there is no basis to refuse the Application and the Application should be \napproved for registration. Under s 126(3) of the Electoral Act you, as a delegate of the Electoral \nCommission, have the authority to approve the Application. \n\nMinute  \n\nPage 6\n\n\n--- Page 7 ---\n\n\n\nProvide only the markdown formatted summary text.
