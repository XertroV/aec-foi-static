The NICC asserts Norfolk Island is a distinct, independent colony not lawfully part of Australia, claiming Australian authority is invalid and indigenous residents are not Australian citizens, thereby making their inclusion in federal elections illegal and demanding the AEC rectify this. Conversely, the AEC maintains its statutory obligation to administer elections under the *Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918*, relying on existing Australian law and High Court decisions affirming Norfolk Island's inclusion, while consistently advising that constitutional and territorial governance issues fall outside its remit and referring such matters to other government departments without further engagement."

  "prompt": "Create a single paragraph summary of the following FOI request summary:\n\nSummary:\n\nThis FOI request pertains to the communications and official stance of the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) regarding the participation of Norfolk Island residents, particularly indigenous Norfolk Islanders, in Australian Federal elections, based on claims about Norfolk Island's constitutional and historical status.\n\n**Documents from the FOI Request:**\n\nThe released documents include:\n*   Formal letters and emails from the Norfolk Island Chamber of Commerce (NICC) and an individual (Cherri Buffett) to the Australian Electoral Commission.\n*   Attachments to these communications, including detailed \"Submissions to the Governance Committee re Preamble\" (with an addendum), which outline historical and legal arguments.\n*   Copies of historical documents such as the Queen Victoria Royal Warrant of 1856 and various Orders in Council relating to Norfolk Island's governance.\n*   Internal government briefs from the Department of Infrastructure, Regional Development and Cities concerning the Norfolk Island Act 1979 Preamble and petitions to the United Nations regarding Norfolk Island's status.\n*   Email correspondence between the AEC's Legal Services and the Norfolk Island Chamber of Commerce/Cherri Buffett.\n*   Official responses from the AEC to the Norfolk Island Chamber of Commerce.\n\n**Main Content from the FOI Request Documents:**\n\nThe core content of the documents revolves around a dispute concerning Norfolk Island's sovereignty and the legality of including its residents in Australian federal elections:\n\n1.  **Norfolk Island Chamber of Commerce's (NICC) Claims:**\n    *   **Independent Status:** The NICC asserts that Norfolk Island is not part of the Commonwealth of Australia, claiming it has been a \"distinct and separate Colony\" since 1856, established by Queen Victoria for the Pitcairn Settlers, who were granted self-governance under the Imperial Crown.\n    *   **Invalid Australian Authority:** They argue that the Australian Government's claim of authority over Norfolk Island, particularly via the Norfolk Island Act 1913, is unlawful and invalid. They contend that Section 122 of the Australian Constitution (regarding territories \"placed by the Queen under the authority of and accepted by the Commonwealth\") was not properly followed, as there was no explicit Imperial legislation or process of \"placement\" and \"acceptance\" as legally required.\n    *   **Citizenship:** The NICC states that indigenous Norfolk Islanders are not Australian citizens, and therefore, their forced inclusion in Australian federal elections is a breach of law and international law.\n    *   **Rejection of Precedent:** The NICC challenges the AEC's reliance on High Court cases (e.g., *Berwick Ltd v Gray* and *Bennett v Commonwealth*), directly citing a portion of Justice Callinan's judgment in *Bennett v Commonwealth* (paragraph 177), which states that Norfolk Island \"did not on its acceptance by Australia, nor has it since, become part of Australia, geographically or politically. Statements to the contrary in Berwick Ltd v Gray [198] are wrong.\"\n    *   **Demand for Rectification:** The NICC repeatedly requests the AEC to immediately rectify what they view as unlawful and illegal actions regarding Norfolk Island's electoral inclusion.\n\n2.  **Australian Electoral Commission's (AEC) Position:**\n    *   **Statutory Obligation:** The AEC states it is a statutory authority required to administer federal elections in accordance with the *Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918*.\n    *   **Reliance on Legal Framework:** The AEC maintains its position based on existing Australian law, specifically the Norfolk Island Act 1913, and the High Court decisions in *Berwick Ltd v Gray* and *Bennett v Commonwealth*, which it interprets as affirming that Norfolk Island forms part of the Commonwealth and that Parliament's power under Section 122 of the Constitution is valid for governing the territory and granting electoral rights.\n    *   **Referral to Other Departments:** The AEC consistently advises the NICC that constitutional and territorial administration matters fall under the responsibility of other government departments, namely the Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development, Communications and the Arts (responsible for territories and Norfolk Island) and the Attorney-General's Department (responsible for constitutional matters). The AEC states it does not intend to engage further on the constitutional issues raised."
