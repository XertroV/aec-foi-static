            "text": "The provided Freedom of Information documents paint a damning picture of a government agency (the AEC) riddled with transparency failures, internal distrust, and a dismissive, bureaucratic response to serious ethical concerns.\n\n**1. Catastrophic Transparency Failure and Deliberate Obfuscation:**\n\n*   **Massive Redactions Under False Pretence:** The overwhelming majority of the \"ELT Townhall 2023 - Transcript\" (25 out of 26 pages) is redacted under the exemption s 22(1)(b)(ii), which relates to \"information that is not relevant to the request.\" This is an egregious misapplication of the FOI Act. If the request was for the \"Transcript of 2023 Town Hall,\" then the *entire transcript* is inherently relevant. This level of redaction strongly suggests a deliberate, systemic attempt to conceal the content of the town hall, rather than a genuine irrelevance of information. It indicates either gross incompetence in processing FOI requests or, more likely, a calculated effort to withhold information from the public and its own employees.\n*   **Selective Release to Control Narrative:** While the main transcript is almost entirely hidden, the \"Transcript of Questions\" is released in full. This creates a highly imbalanced and misleading view. The agency is comfortable revealing the *concerns* of its staff but ruthlessly suppresses its *own responses and discussions*. This is a transparent tactic to control the public narrative, allowing the agency to appear open to feedback while simultaneously burying its potentially damaging internal dialogue and official stances.\n*   **Shoddy Record-Keeping and Process:** The reliance on a \"voice to text AI function\" to produce the town hall transcript, followed by its near-total redaction under a relevance clause, raises serious questions about the agency's record-keeping integrity. It implies either the AI transcription was so poor as to be unusable (highlighting technological incompetence) or that the agency retrospectively deemed the vast majority of its own town hall discussions \"irrelevant\" to hide their content, undermining the very purpose of an FOI request.\n\n**2. Deep-Seated Internal Distrust and Ethical Lapses:**\n\n*   **Staff Distrust of Senior Leadership:** The anonymous question, \"Some of us have been super concerned watching Robodebt. Could we have an independent ethics adviser, not an AEC SES, so if we need to consult someone we can,\" is a profound indictment of the AEC's internal culture. It reveals a pervasive lack of trust in the impartiality and integrity of the agency's own Senior Executive Service (SES). Staff explicitly state they cannot rely on their direct leadership for ethical guidance, fearing reprisal or biased advice. This suggests a climate where employees feel unsafe raising concerns through official channels.\n*   **Fear of Speaking Out (Anonymity):** Both critical questions regarding ethics and Robodebt were submitted anonymously, further underscoring the climate of fear and lack of psychological safety within the agency. Employees evidently believe that openly associating their names with concerns about ethics and independence could lead to negative consequences.\n*   **Superficial Denial of Systemic Issues:** The isolated, unredacted snippet mentioning \"Robo debt\" on page 20, where the Commissioner claims, \"I've certainly never seen anything like that, any systemic large scale events such as that internally in the AC and I don't think you're in fact I'd even go back before I arrived even in our history in our 3040 odd year history,\" is a breathtakingly arrogant and potentially false denial. To dismiss the possibility of systemic failures over decades, especially in response to an employee's \"super concern\" about Robodebt, reveals a dangerous level of complacency or active whitewashing of organizational history. This pre-emptively shuts down genuine self-reflection and accountability.\n\n**3. Incompetent and Dismissive Leadership Response:**\n\n*   **Trivializing Serious Concerns:** The moderator's (Jeff's) initial response, \"That is an interesting perspective,\" to a staff member's \"super concern\" about a national scandal and demand for independent ethics advice is condescending and dismissive. It minimizes a critical ethical issue as a mere \"perspective\" rather than acknowledging a legitimate fear.\n*   **Deflective and Bureaucratic Non-Answers:** Instead of addressing the core issue of distrust in AEC's internal ethics mechanisms, Jeff's responses are a masterclass in bureaucratic evasion.\n    *   He immediately denies personal observation of \"Robodebt-like behaviour\" in his 10 years, which is irrelevant to systemic issues that might predate him or be hidden from his direct view.\n    *   He deflects responsibility to the \"Australian Public Service Commission\" and provides a generic list of \"many ways to seek advice in the public service.\" This avoids any commitment to improving *AEC's specific internal culture* that causes the distrust.\n    *   His second response, a boilerplate recitation of generic \"avenues open to raise concerns\" (including \"line managers,\" \"HR,\" \"conduct units,\" etc.), is a direct insult to the original anonymous question. The staff explicitly asked for an *independent* advisor, not a rehash of the very internal mechanisms they distrust. This demonstrates a complete failure to comprehend or a deliberate refusal to address the fundamental lack of trust in AEC's existing internal integrity frameworks.\n*   **Passing the Buck:** The statement that \"Following the findings of Robodebt the APS will be doing more work around this\" is a classic bureaucratic evasion, passing responsibility to a higher, more abstract entity (the APS as a whole) rather than committing the AEC to specific internal reforms or genuine assurance for its own staff.\n\nIn conclusion, these documents reveal an AEC that operates with a veil of secrecy, is deeply distrusted by its own employees on critical ethical matters, and responds to legitimate concerns with dismissive, deflective, and fundamentally inadequate bureaucratic platitudes, all while redacting almost its entire internal discourse from public scrutiny. This paints a grim picture of an agency that is failing in its duties of transparency, accountability, and fostering an ethical and trustful internal environment."

Uh, I'm Tom Rogers. For those that haven't met me, and I know we've got a number \nof new staff and I'm the electoral commissioner. Let me welcome you to this Town Hall and to start \nthat I'd like to \n\n0:25 \nbegin by acknowledging the traditional custodians of the country throughout Australia and pay my \nrespects to the elders past and present. So welcome. \n\n0:35 \nThese town halls have proven to be very popular. It's a great way of us being able to give you an \nagency wide update of what's occurring, but also importantly to give you the opportunity to ask any \nquestions that you might have of any of the executive \n\n0:48 \nfor those that have been on these town halls before, you'll know the format. Each of us, each member \nof the executive is going to talk for a bit about what we're doing or issues that we think you might be \ninterested in. \n\n1:01 \nAnd at the same time, we'll have time for questions. So just to remind people, you can ask questions \nin a couple of different ways. You can wait till the end of everyone talking or if you've got a question \non the way through, please ask it in the chat function, in the Q&A function. We'll do everything we \npossibly can to answer those questions. We've got a good track record of answering all of those \nquestions. If we can't just because of time or it's too long, we'll take it on notice and come back to \nyou. We'll either respond \n\n1:31 \nand writing or I'll get one of the executive team to jump on and actually answer the question \npersonally where we can.

Could we have an \nreply from Moderator \nindependent ethics adviser, not an AEC SES, so if we need to consult someone we can. \nModerator \n11/15/2023 2:46 PM \n\nThat is an interesting perspective. Firstly I would say what occurred in Robodebt is \nterrible and I have not seen any of that sort of behaviour, or anything close to it, in the \nAEC in my 10 years here. If you are looking for something independent I would suggest \nthe Australian Public Service Commission but there are many ways to seek advise in the \nQuestion from anonymous user \npublic service or to escalate concerns, including anonymously. Thanks, Jeff \nAnonymous \n11/15/2023 2:39 PM \n\n8\nThis is a comment in relation to a previous question about impartial ethics advice - the \nAPSC has an Ethics Advisory Service https://www.apsc.gov.au/working-\nreply from Moderator \naps/integrity/ethics-advisory-service \nModerator \n11/15/2023 2:47 PM \n\nThanks for the comment. Following the findings of Robodebt the APS will be doing more \nwork around this. You'll also see on the APSC website that there are a range of avenues \nopen to raise concerns, including line managers harassment contact officers yees for \ndealing with concerns, central conduct or integrity units nominated individuals or \nteams in HR, including employee advice units or hotlines, or fraud prevention and \ncontrol units or hotlines email reporting addresses ‘authorised officers’ who receive \npublic interest disclosures.\n\nProvide only the markdown formatted summary text.
