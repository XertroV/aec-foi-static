Main Content from the FOI Request Documents\n\nThe released documents provide content primarily related to the first part of the FOI request concerning staff adherence to professional standards and limitations on public communication. No documents were provided regarding MOUs with the Australian Federal Police.\n\n##### a. Measures for AEC Staff Adherence to APS Values, Employment Principles, and Code of Conduct:\n\n*   **Formal Breach Procedures:**\n    *   `AEC Procedures for Determining Breaches of the APS Code of Conduct and Sanctions` outlines the process for investigating suspected breaches of the APS Code of Conduct, including who can determine a breach, the requirement for procedural fairness (informing the employee, opportunity to respond, independent decision-makers), and the selection of proportionate sanctions (ranging from reprimand to termination). Records of determinations and sanctions are required.\n*   **Obligation Acknowledgement at Engagement:**\n    *   The `Acknowledgement and declaration of key obligations` form requires staff to acknowledge their commitment to political neutrality, avoiding conflicts of interest, accuracy of provided information, Work Health and Safety (WHS) compliance, and familiarity with relevant legislation (including the Public Service Act 1999) and AEC policies. It specifically references the APS Values, APS Employment Principles, and Code of Conduct as key obligations.\n    *   The `Letter of engagement as an ongoing APS employee` explicitly states that engagement is conditional on \"Complying with the Australian Public Service (APS) Values and Code of Conduct.\" It reiterates the requirement for political neutrality and details several points of the APS Code of Conduct (e.g., honesty, diligence, respect, compliance with laws/directions, confidentiality, conflict of interest avoidance, proper resource use, not providing false information, upholding integrity). Failure to meet these conditions can lead to offer withdrawal or employment termination.\n*   **Induction and Training Programs:**\n    *   The `APS1 Induction and training booklet` introduces new staff to the AEC's values (Electoral Integrity, Quality, Agility, Professionalism, \"Every task matters,\" and \"Ballot paper principles\"), the APS Values (ICARE: Impartial, Committed to service, Accountable, Respectful, Ethical), and the full text of the APS Code of Conduct. It emphasizes that Code breaches can lead to sanctions up to termination. It lists mandatory eLearning courses covering WHS, Protective Security, Fraud, Privacy, IT Security, and Ballot Paper Handling, among others.\n    *   The `National Induction Program` documents (`Outline`, `Curriculum Overview`, `Roles and Responsibilities`, `Detailed curriculum and associated learning outcomes`) describe a structured, nationally consistent induction program for APS2-SES staff (APS1 staff are noted as outside its direct scope, but are covered by the APS1 booklet). This program aims to ensure staff behave in accordance with AEC/APS values and the Code of Conduct, promote a positive organizational culture, and comply with policies and legislation. The curriculum explicitly includes modules on APS Values and Code of Conduct, Privacy, Protective Security, Fraud, Political Neutrality, Conflict of Interest, and Public Governance. It defines the roles and responsibilities of Line Managers, Local Induction Advisers, Executive Level Officers, and Trainers in guiding new staff to meet these standards, emphasizing professional conduct and adherence to established procedures.\n\n##### b. Limitations, Restrictions, or Prohibitions on Telephone Communication with Members of the Public:\n\n*   **Public Engagement Team Handbook:**\n    *   Outlines the responsibilities of Public Enquiries Officers, including answering calls to the National Office switchboard and managing public email inquiries.\n    *   Details contact telephone numbers, hours of operation (9am-5pm, Mon-Fri, diverted to call centre during federal elections).\n    *   Provides procedures for **Interpreter Calls** and the **National Relay Service**.\n    *   Specifies instructions for **Transferring switchboard to an internal number** and back.\n    *   Under \"Incoming calls\" (Appendix A), it explicitly states:\n        *   Marketing and sales calls are *not* to be transferred to staff.\n        *   Officers *may not confirm* whether a person works for the AEC, a person’s work number, a person’s email address, or the format of AEC email addresses.\n        *   For Senior Executive Staff (Assistant Commissioners and above), Public Enquiries Officers *do not transfer calls from members of the public*; instead, they take a message. For MPs, Senators, major political party executives, or other Government Agency callers, contact relevant Executive Assistants or Branch Project Officers for discussion.\n    *   Details the AEC's responsibility for recording **Recorded messages for switchboard** for outside business hours, public holidays, and emergencies, including specific scripts for these messages.\n*   **APS1 Induction and Training Booklet:**\n    *   Includes a \"Public Enquiries\" section with guidelines for quality client service, emphasizing a positive and helpful approach, accurate information, and timely resolution.\n    *   Sets \"Service level standards\" for public contact channels: Phone (answered within 90 seconds), Walk-in (acknowledged within 5 minutes), Email/Post (responded within 5 working days).\n    *   Instructs staff to resolve straightforward inquiries at the first point of contact and record them in the Public Engagement Contact Tool (PECT).\n    *   For more complex inquiries, or those from political parties/candidates, staff are instructed to refer them to their supervisor or the Divisional Returning Officer (DRO).\n    *   All complaints are to be logged in PECT, acknowledged promptly, and resolved within 10 business days.\n\n##### c.
