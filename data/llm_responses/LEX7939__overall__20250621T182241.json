The request aimed to understand the number of designated electors, how many were declared in recent financial years, who made these declarations, the volume and outcomes of internal reviews of these declarations, and the number of external reviews (to the Administrative Review Tribunal) and declarations ceasing effect.\n\n**Documents from the FOI Request:**\nThe provided document *is* the response to the FOI request. It does not include separate attachments but directly provides answers and numerical data within the body of the response, structured against each original query from the applicant. For one specific item (1), it notes that no *document* response could be provided as per a decision letter, but then offers context regarding where similar general data can be found on the AEC website.\n\n**Main Content from the FOI Request Documents:**\nThe document directly addresses each point of the FOI request, providing the following key information:\n\n1.  **Number of Designated Electors (as at 7 April 2025):** The request for a breakdown of designated electors by state/territory and electoral division for a future date (7 April 2025) was not met with a specific document response. However, the AEC noted that historical data on designated electors per federal electoral event since 2019 is available on their website.\n2.  **Number of Designated Electors Declared by Financial Year:**\n    *   2022/23: 37 declarations\n    *   2023/24: 1 declaration\n    *   2024/25 (to date): 211 declarations\n    *   All these declarations were made by a delegate of the Electoral Commissioner, not by the Commissioner directly.\n3.  **Number of Unique Applications for Internal Review:**\n    *   2022/23: 4 applications\n    *   2023/24: 0 applications\n    *   2024/25 (to date): 4 applications\n4.  **Outcome of Unique Internal Review Decisions:**\n    *   2022/23: All 4 applications were **confirmed**.\n    *   2023/24: Not applicable (no applications).\n    *   2024/25 (to date): 3 applications were **confirmed**, and 1 was **set aside**.\n5.  **Applications for Review to the Administrative Review Tribunal (ART):**\n    *   2024/25 (to date): 0 applications for review to the ART.\n6.  **Declarations Ceasing to Have Effect (s 202AH(3)):**\n    *   For financial years 2022/23, 2023/24, and 2024/25 (to date): 0 declarations ceased to have effect by virtue of s 202AH(3)."
