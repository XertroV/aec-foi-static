It confirms that the AEC has responded to *The Guardian* regarding its investigation into Andrew Laming MP's Facebook page authorisations, explicitly stating the response \"simply confirms our investigation of the matter.\" The email indicates that a follow-up article from *The Guardian* focusing on the AEC investigation is expected soon. It also notes significant public skepticism on Twitter regarding the AEC's capacity or impartiality to act on the matter, prompting the AEC to plan monitoring and selective responses to online discourse. Electoral Commissioner Tom Rogers emphasizes the need to \"move pretty smartly\" with the issue.\n\n**Relevance to FOI request:**\nThis document directly pertains to the FOI request by providing a real-time snapshot of the AEC's internal communication and media management regarding its active investigation into Andrew Laming MP's Facebook pages. It confirms the AEC's engagement with media inquiries (specifically *The Guardian*) about the investigation, highlights the public and media scrutiny surrounding the case, and demonstrates the AEC's awareness of the urgency and public perception concerning the ongoing inquiry into compliance with federal electoral authorisation laws."

  "prompt": "Considering this document as part of an FOI request, summarize the document and its relevance to the FOI request in markdown format. Provide only the markdown formatted summary text. Do not include any conversational filler or preamble.To aid you, the overview of the FOI request is: [REQUEST OVERVIEW START] The FOI request disclosed documents detailing the Australian Electoral Commission's (AEC) investigation into Andrew Laming MP's Facebook pages for compliance with federal electoral authorisation laws. This inquiry was triggered by public complaints and media reports, notably from *The Guardian*, alleging Laming used numerous pages (e.g., \"Redland Bay Bulletin,\" \"Redlands Institute\") disguised as community or news groups to promote political content and attack opponents without mandatory disclosures. The AEC confirmed an active investigation, noting 2018 Electoral Act amendments broadened social media authorisation, and issued formal notices to Laming for detailed information and to third parties (like Facebook) for data, with Facebook confirming its cooperation. Findings revealed some pages were removed or updated with authorisation, while others remained active and unauthorised.\n [REQUEST OVERVIEW END] \n\n--- MAIN DOCUMENT TEXT START ---\n\n\n\n--- Page 1 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 2 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 3 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 4 ---\n\nAEC.0002.0001.1270\n\nFrom: Tom Rogers <Tom.Rogers@aec.gov.au> Sent: Wednesday, 7 April 2021 11:27 AMTo: media <media@aec.gov.au>; Executive Leadership Team <ExecutiveLeadershipTeam@aec.gov.au>Subject: RE: Guardian response re Laming FB authorisation [SEC=OFFICIAL] Thanks, Evan – we’ll need to make sure we move pretty smartly with this.

The response simply confirms our investigation of the matter and otherwise provides minor extraneous details re application of the law. Receipt has been acknowledged & we can expect a follow-up article very soon with AEC investigation as a lead.  Twitter activityThere is a reasonable level of Twitter activity on the matter off the back of tweets like the ones below. The general response in relation to the AEC – from members of the public - is a mixture of “don’t expect AEC to do anything”, “the AEC is biased so won’t take action” and “they don’t have any power to take action”.  As is standard on the channel – purple signs have been raised a number of times.  We will monitor Twitter traffic and provide some select responses – based on the below enquiry response.   CheersEvan\n\n\n--- Page 5 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 6 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 7 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 8 ---\n\nAEC.0002.0001.1274\n\n"
