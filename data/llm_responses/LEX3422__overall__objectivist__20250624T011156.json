            "text": "The Australian Electoral Commission's (AEC) FOI documents regarding \"Complaints Management Procedures\" starkly illustrate the dangers of collectivism and government overreach, serving as a prime example of bureaucratic interference antithetical to individual liberty and laissez-faire capitalism.\n\n**Violation of Individual Rights and Liberty through Bureaucratic Overreach:**\nThe very existence of such an extensive, prescriptive framework for managing citizen complaints reveals a fundamental misapprehension of government's legitimate role. A just government, in a truly free society, would be limited to protecting individual rights – life, liberty, and property – from the initiation of force. Its primary function would not be to offer \"services\" or manage \"dissatisfaction\" over electoral rolls, which themselves raise questions of individual privacy and the state's undue compilation of personal data.\n\nThe detailed \"Complaints Management Procedures\" (Doc No. 8) are a testament to bureaucratic expansion. They outline rigid steps for \"Receipt,\" \"Assessment,\" \"Assignment,\" \"Acknowledgement,\" \"Investigation,\" and \"Response,\" complete with strict timeframes, required record-keeping, and template responses. This level of granular control is not about protecting individual rights but about managing and containing public dissent within a pre-defined statist framework. The \"right to make a complaint,\" as acknowledged, is merely a procedural concession granted by the state, rather than an unalienable individual right to demand non-initiation of force.\n\n**Suppression of Personal Initiative and Rational Self-Interest:**\nThe document consistently prioritizes institutional self-interest over individual initiative and rational self-interest. The stated purpose of effective complaints management for the AEC includes \"strengthen[ing] our organisational reputation\" and \"reduc[ing] the volume of complaints received.\" These are metrics of bureaucratic efficiency and public image, not indicators of value creation or the protection of individual liberty.\n\nFurthermore, the procedures explicitly suppress the personal initiative and independent judgment of AEC staff. They are required to \"act in compliance with the Policy and these Procedures\" and use prescribed \"templates\" for communication. This transforms individuals into cogs in a collective machine, stifling their capacity for rational thought and independent action in addressing specific situations. The meticulous \"record keeping\" and the centralized \"Public Engagement Contact Tool\" represent resources diverted from any potentially productive function to purely administrative overhead, designed for bureaucratic oversight rather than genuine problem-solving driven by individual ingenuity.\n\n**Antithesis to Laissez-Faire Capitalism:**\nThis entire framework is fundamentally at odds with the principles of laissez-faire capitalism. In a free market, service providers are held accountable by voluntary transactions and the individual's choice to take their business elsewhere. Complaint resolution would be driven by market forces, a company's desire to retain customers, and contractual agreements, not by elaborate government protocols enforced from above. The AEC's role in \"managing online access to the Australian electoral roll\" and \"detect[ing] and prevent[ing] unlawful disclosures of protected information\" (FOI request points 2a, 2b) implies a state-managed information system that would ideally be decentralized and privately managed in a truly free society, with individuals having direct control over their own data.\n\nThe focus on \"monitoring performance\" and \"reporting arrangements\" through quantitative and consolidated reports further illustrates a collectivist approach, where governmental success is measured by process adherence and statistical aggregation, not by the empowerment and prosperity of individual citizens. This is the hallmark of a system where the state asserts control over areas that rightfully belong to the sphere of individual choice and private enterprise.\n\nIn summary, the AEC's Complaints Management Procedures, while superficially presenting an organized approach to public feedback, epitomize bureaucratic overreach and the dangers of collectivism. They replace individual initiative and market-driven solutions with rigid, top-down control, diverting resources to self-serving institutional maintenance rather than upholding the foundational principles of individual rights, rational self-interest, and laissez-faire capitalism."

The Framework is \ndesigned to provide a consistent professional structure for the decentralised management \nof complaints within the AEC.  \n\nThe AEC’s Service Charter explains the standard of service that the AEC is expected to \nprovide. The Framework acknowledges that the public and other stakeholders have a right \nto make a complaint where it is viewed that the AEC has not met this quality of service, \nand the AEC has an obligation to manage complaints in compliance with the Framework. \n\nScope \nThe Framework applies to complaints that originate from external parties and are lodged \nwith the AEC. Complaints management is a decentralised responsibility handled at the \ndivisional, state/territory and National Office level. The Procedures are designed to \nprovide consistent, national direction for complaints management that must be followed by \nall staff when managing complaints.   \n\nIf a particular work area, such as a state/territory office or branch, creates localised \ncomplaints management arrangements to support the implementation of the Policy or the \nProcedures, the localised arrangements must not contradict the national Framework.  \n\nThese Procedures should be read alongside the Policy and Internal Review Management \nProcedures.   \n\nThe importance of effective complaints management \nManaging complaints is one of the most important stakeholder relationship activities that \nstaff undertake on behalf of the AEC.  Effective complaints management is important \nbecause it provides us with the opportunity to: \n•  resolve an issue of dissatisfaction raised by a member of the public or stakeholder  \n•  ensure that a complainant’s overall experience of our services is positive \n• \n•  review our organisational performance \n• \nimplement business improvements, and  \n•  strengthen our organisational reputation. \n\nimprove the way we do business so that we reduce the volume of complaints received \n\nPage 5    Complaints Management Procedures | 2015\n\n\n--- Page 7 ---\n\nOther policies and procedures governing complaints \nmanagement \nThere are also specific AEC policies and procedures that prescribe how legal, fraud, \nprivacy and public interest disclosure complaints are to be managed, in order to meet \nspecific legislative requirements.  \n\nThese complaints are managed by the relevant business areas only, in compliance with \nthe Framework and these other governing policy and procedures. The Procedures provide \nguidance on escalating these complaints to these business areas.  \n\nOperation during electoral event periods \nThe Framework applies at all times including during electoral events. During electoral \nevents priority must be given for the acknowledgement of, and response to, electoral \nevent related complaints. \n\nRoles and responsibilities \n\nAll staff \nAll staff have a role in, and are responsible for, the effective management of complaints.  \n\nWhether managing a complaint, or providing information and assistance to another \nmanaging a complaint, all staff must understand their responsibilities in this process.   \n\nStaff responsibilities include: \n• \n• \n• \n\nunderstanding the Framework and how it relates to their role  \n\nacting in compliance with the Policy and these Procedures  \n\nunderstanding any localised complaints management arrangements that support the \nimplementation of the Policy and Procedures and acting in compliance with them \n\n• \n\nacting in accordance with broader legislation, APS Code of Conduct and other \nrequirements as AEC employees. \n\nThese responsibilities must be undertaken in a timely manner to ensure that complaints \nare resolved at the earliest opportunity. \n\nPublic engagement staff \nStaff with specific responsibilities for public engagement, such as those with frontline roles \nin divisional offices, are likely to be the first point of contact for most complaints received \nby the AEC.  It is especially important that these staff fully understand and comply with the \nPolicy and Procedures.   \n\nPage 6    Complaints Management Procedures | 2015\n\n\n--- Page 8 ---\n\nState/territory Managers and Assistant Commissioners \nState/territory managers and Assistant Commissioners are responsible for ensuring that \ntheir staff undertake complaint management in compliance with the Framework, Policy \nand Procedures, and for providing management support within their workplaces.   \n\nAssistant Commissioner, Education and Communications \nThe Assistant Commissioner, Education and Communications, is responsible for the \nComplaints Management Framework, which includes establishing and monitoring of the \nPolicy, Procedures, other supporting documents and the system for recording and \nmanaging complaints, the Public Engagement Contact Tool. The Assistant Commissioner, \n\nEducation and Communications is also the internal central contact for the receipt and \nescalation of internal review requests. \n\nPublic Engagement Contact Tool \nThe Public Engagement Contact Tool (the Tool) is the national system that supports the \nmanagement of enquiries, complaints and feedback to the AEC.   \n\nEvery complaint received by the AEC must be recorded in the Public Engagement \nContact Tool.  This includes less complex complaints that are resolved at first point of \ncontact. \n\nfacilitating the efficient resolution of complaints \n\nimproving communication in complaint management \n\nRecording all complaints in the Tool provides organisational benefits including:  \n• \n• \n• \n• \n• \n• \n\nproviding information to monitor performance in managing complaints \n\nproviding information to review organisational performance \n\nsupporting staff in their engagement with complainants \n\nproviding information on trends and issues that can lead to business improvements. \n\nThe Tool is also the mechanism to escalate complaints to other staff and business areas \nfor their response.  A reference guide is available which provides instructions on how to \nrecord and manage a complaint in the Tool.  \n\nRecord keeping \nStaff must understand their recordkeeping obligations and responsibilities and adhere to \nthe AEC’s recordkeeping policy and supporting procedures in the management of \ncomplaints.  \n\nThe record of a complaint in the Tool should include as attachments, all key \ncorrespondence that relates to the complaint. If there are any confidentiality or privacy \nissues with a complaint, identifying information should not be entered into or attached to \nthe tool, but a file reference made to where it is kept. \n\nPage 7    Complaints Management Procedures | 2015\n\n\n--- Page 9 ---\n\nIn addition to the online Tool, it is expected that each state/territory and branch office will \nmaintain consolidated files in relation to their complaint management.  \n\nSupporting resources \nThese procedures should be read alongside: \n• \n• \n\nAEC Complaints Management Policy \n\nAEC Service Charter \n\nEngaging with Stakeholders at the AEC – A Best Practice Guide \n\nFurther information on public enquiries and client contact is available on the AEC intranet: \n• \n• \n• \n• \n\nManaging Public Enquiries and Dealing with Difficult People  \n\nList of recommended national office contact referral points for complaints (at \nattachment b) \n\nPublic Enquiries intranet page \n\nPage 8    Complaints Management Procedures | 2015\n\n\n--- Page 10 ---\n\nComplaints Management \n\nDefinition of a complaint \nA complaint is where an individual or organisation has expressed dissatisfaction to the \nAEC in relation to an AEC service, process or program, or where it is viewed the AEC has \nnot met its expected quality of service.     \n\nComplaints are one form of contact that the AEC has with the public and stakeholders \nthrough its external engagement channels.  The vast majority of contact is in the form of \nan enquiry which is defined as a request for information or service, or the provision of \nfeedback such as a suggestion or compliment.  These must be managed in compliance \nwith the information on the Public Enquiries and client contact intranet page.  \n\nTypes of complaints \nThe Policy defines complaints into the broad categories – general nature, legal nature, \nregarding electoral fraud, breach of privacy, Public Interest Disclosure and those that are \noutside AEC responsibilities.  \n\nPrinciples for complaints management \nThe Policy outlines six principles – accessibility, responsiveness, confidentiality, fairness, \ntransparency and efficiency – that are fundamental to an effective complaints \nmanagement process.  It is important that you understand and follow these principles \nwhen managing complaints. \n\nFirst point of contact resolution \nWherever possible, complaints should be resolved at the first point of contact.  This \nmeans that the complaint is resolved by the person who initially receives the complaint \nand often at the same time the complaint is received.  \n\nComplaint management service standards \n\nAcknowledgment \nA complaint must be acknowledged within three working days of its receipt by the AEC.  \n\nDuring electoral event periods, acknowledging an election-related complaint must be \ngiven priority. \n\nResponse \nA complainant should be provided with a response within ten working days of its receipt, \nunless they have been specifically informed the investigation will take longer.  \n\nPage 9    Complaints Management Procedures | 2015\n\n\n--- Page 11 ---\n\nDuring electoral event periods, an election-related complaint must be given priority and \nresolved as soon as possible after its receipt. \n\nIf a complaint is found to be more complex than originally expected and advised, a \ncomplainant must be advised of a revised timeframe for response as soon as \npracticable. \n\nPage 10    Complaints Management Procedures | 2015\n\n\n--- Page 12 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 13 ---\n\nExtra assistance is available for: \n•  people who are deaf or have a hearing or speech impairment who can contact the AEC \n\nthrough the National Relay Service  \n\n•  people who would prefer to contact the AEC in a language other than English who can \n\ncontact the AEC through the telephone interpreter service. \n\nThe AEC may also be able to provide other assistance to a complainant to assist them in \nthe complaints process, on request.  You should work with the complainant to ensure that \nthey are adequately, and reasonably, supported during the complaints management \nprocess. \n\nComplaints of a serious or complex nature lodged in person or phone \nIf a complaint is received in person or over the phone, and it is apparent that it is of a \ncomplex or serious nature, you should request that the complainant lodges their complaint \nin writing, wherever possible. \n\nIf it is not possible for a complainant to lodge their complaint in writing, it is critical that you \npromptly record all details of the complaint, along with the contact details of the \ncomplainant in the Tool.   \n\nComplaints lodged anonymously or using a pseudonym \nThe Policy outlines the right for complainants to lodge their complaint anonymously or \nusing a pseudonym.   \n\nComplaints lodged anonymously are to be managed, as far as possible, in line with the \nPolicy and these Procedures, however, if relevant information is not provided, and there is \nno other reasonable way to gain it, there may be limitations to the process.  \n\nComplaints lodged indicating ‘no further contact’ \nThe Policy outlines the option for complainants to specify whether they wish to be \ncontacted regarding the complaint. If a complainant indicates that they do not wish to be \ncontacted, the complaint is to be investigated but no acknowledgment or response is \nprovided to the complainant.  \n\nComplaints which do not fall within AEC responsibility \nIf it is clear that the nature of the complaint relates to matters outside the AEC’s area of \nresponsibility, you should inform the complainant that the complaint cannot be managed \nby the AEC.  In such cases, wherever possible, you should provide the details of an \nappropriate organisation to which the complainant can refer their complaint.  \n\nManaging difficult behaviour at lodgement \nIf a complaint is lodged with aggressive or rude behaviour or language, you are supported \nin communicating to complainants that their behaviour is not tolerated in our workplace.  \n\nPage 12    Complaints Management Procedures | 2015\n\n\n--- Page 14 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 15 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 16 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 17 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 18 ---\n\nIf you are unsure you should consult with your manager.  Alternatively, you can \ncontact the specialist business area above, by phone, and discuss with them the \ncomplaint that you have received. \n\nOnce a fraud/privacy/Public Interest Disclosure/legal request has been escalated to the \nrelevant area, you are no longer responsible for management of the complaint. \n\nThe relevant area will be responsible for entering the complaint into the Tool. \n\nEscalating general complaints \n\nii) \nIf the complaint is a general complaint then you are to record the details of the complaint \nin the Tool, and attach copies of related correspondence. This will assign the complaint \nwith a unique identification number which is to be used in any further correspondence with \nthe complainant. \n\nYou are then to use the Tool to escalate the complaint, by assigning the complaint to a \nselected staff member or business area. \n\nA list of contact points for escalating complaints, such as the Roll Management Helpdesk \nor Funding and Disclosure Helpdesk is available.  When available, the generic contact \npoint for the business area that the complaint relates to is the preferred referral point.   \n\nIf a generic contact point or specific staff member, based on their job title, cannot be \nidentified, you should consult with your manager to determine who the complaint should \nbe escalated to.  \n\nIf a complaint has been assessed as high in terms of risk, complexity, urgency or \nseriousness, once you have escalated it via the Tool you should also phone the relevant \nstaff member/business area to draw their attention to it.   \n\nIf there are any confidentiality or privacy issues with a complaint, identifying information \nshould not be entered into or attached to the tool, but provided separately to the \nescalation point. \n\nOnce the complaint has been escalated you are no longer responsible for the \nmanagement of the complaint. \n\nReceiving an escalated complaint \nIf you have been escalated a complaint to manage via the Tool, you will receive advice via \nan email.  You are now responsible for conducting the management of the complaint from \nstep four ‘Acknowledgement’. \n\nIt is also suggested that you revisit the assessment of the complaint against the factors \noutlined in step two ‘Assessment’ on page 14. \n\nPage 17    Complaints Management Procedures | 2015\n\n\n--- Page 19 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 20 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 21 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 22 ---\n\nreceive it before you provide any response to the complainant.  If you are not sure \nwhether any approval is needed, you should consult with your manager. \n\nIf a complaint has been assessed as high in terms of risk, complexity or seriousness the \n\nstate/territory manager or Assistant Commissioner must provide approval for the \nresponse. You must also comply with any localised approval arrangements in place. \n\nContent of the response \nOnce you have approval for your response you should advise the complainant as soon as \npracticable.  In your response you should include: \n\n• \n• \n\n• \n\n• \n• \n\na clear statement of the AEC’s decision in response to the complaint \n\nan explanation of the investigation undertaken including reference to any relevant \nlegislation or policy \n\nan explanation of any corresponding action that we may be taking (for example, \n\namending a process or updating information on our website)  \n\nan apology, if there has been any AEC mistake or misunderstanding, and \n\nthe internal review process available to them if they are dissatisfied with the process \nused to investigate their complaint, or with our response to their complaint. \n\nComplaint response templates \nThe complaint response templates must be used when providing a response to a \ncomplaint.  \n\nIf the complainant has requested that they not be contacted regarding the outcome of their \ncomplaint then do not provide them with a response. \n\nChannel of response \nWhen responding to a complaint, generally you should provide the response in the \nchannel that the complaint was received.  For example, if the complaint was received via \nemail you should provide the response by return email.   \n\nHowever, there may be some cases when specific consideration is needed to determine \nwhether using the same channel is appropriate to provide the response.  This is \nparticularly the case for more complex complaints that are received over the phone, via \nsocial media, or in person. \n\nTimeframe for response \nA complainant should be provided with a response within ten working days of its receipt, \nunless they have been specifically informed the investigation will take longer.  \n\nDuring electoral event periods, an election-related complaint must be given priority and \nresolved as soon as possible after its receipt. \n\nPage 21    Complaints Management Procedures | 2015\n\n\n--- Page 23 ---\n\nIf a complaint is found to be more complex than originally expected and advised, a \ncomplainant must be advised of a revised timeframe for response as soon as \npracticable. A template response is available. \n\nRecording in the Public Engagement Contact Tool \nAfter the response has been provided to the complainant, details of the investigation \nundertaken and the response provided must be entered and/or attached to the complaint \n\nrecord in the Tool.   \n\nIf there are any confidentiality or privacy issues with a complaint, identifying information \nshould not be entered into or attached to the tool, but a file reference made to where it is \nkept. \n\nWhere a written response is not provided, it is important to record the response given over \nthe phone or in person in the Tool.  You should also include detail as to whether the \ncomplainant appeared satisfied with the response provided. \n\nIn addition to recording the details in the Tool, staff must understand their recordkeeping \nobligations and responsibilities and adhere to the recordkeeping policy and supporting \nprocedures. It is expected that each state/territory and branch office will maintain \nconsolidated files in relation to their complaint management.  \n\nPage 22    Complaints Management Procedures | 2015\n\n\n--- Page 24 ---\n\nAn overview of the complaints management process \n\nPage 23    Complaints Management Procedures | 2015\n\n\n--- Page 25 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 26 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 27 ---\n\nExtra support available to assist lodgement \nYou should make any complainant who may require particular assistance aware that there \nis extra assistance available to support them. This is part of the AEC’s commitment to \nhaving an accessible complaint management process. \n\nExtra assistance is available for: \n\n•  People who are deaf or have a hearing or speech impairment who can contact the \n\nAEC through the National Relay Service  \n\n•  People who would prefer to contact the AEC in a language other than English who \n\ncan contact the AEC through the telephone interpreter service. \n\nThe AEC may also be able to provide other assistance to a complainant to assist them in \nthe complaints process, on request.  You should work with the complainant to ensure that \nthey are adequately, and reasonably, supported during the complaints management \nprocess. \n\nRequests for an internal review lodged anonymously or using a \npseudonym \nThe Policy outlines a complainant’s right to lodge a request for an internal review \nanonymously or using a pseudonym.  A request for an internal review lodged \nanonymously is still to be escalated.   \n\nRequest for an internal review lodged with no contact details \nThe Policy requests complainants to provide contact details. If a complainant does not \nprovide any/sufficient contact details, the request for an internal review is still to be \nescalated.  \n\nRequest for an internal review lodged indicating ‘no further contact’ \nThe Policy outlines the option for complainants to specify whether they wish to be \ncontacted regarding their request for an internal review. If a complainant indicates they do \nnot wish to be contacted, the request for an internal review is still to be escalated. \n\nEscalating a request for an internal review \nIf you receive a request for an internal review, you must escalate it to the Assistant \nCommissioner, Education and Communications via the Tool. \n\nThis escalation should occur immediately, but as soon as possible on the same \nworking day, of receiving a request for an internal review. \n\nWhen escalating the request, you should include as much detail as possible in the Tool, \nincluding specifically stating that the complainant has requested an internal review, and \nthe time and date that they requested it.   \n\nPage 26    Complaints Management Procedures | 2015\n\n\n--- Page 28 ---\n\nAny supporting documentation to accompany the request, such as an email exchange \nbetween the complainant and the AEC, or a letter from the complainant, must be scanned \nand attached to the entry in the Tool. \n\nIf you believe that the complainant has not provided sufficient information for the AEC to \nundertake an internal review, you must still escalate the request.  You should not seek \nfurther information yourself.  When the request is assigned to staff to undertake the \nreview, if there is not sufficient information then they will seek it themselves. \n\nIf you assess the request as high in terms of risk, complexity, urgency or seriousness, \nonce you have escalated it via the Tool you should contact the Assistant Commissioner, \nEducation and Communications to draw their attention to it. \n\nIf there are any confidentiality or privacy issues with a complaint, identifying information \nshould not be entered into or attached to the Tool, but should be provided separately to \nthe Assistant Commissioner, Education and Communications. \n\nWhilst you may be called upon to assist during the internal review process, once a request \nfor an internal review has been escalated to the Assistant Commissioner, Education and \n\nCommunications, you are no longer responsible for the review. \n\nPage 27    Complaints Management Procedures | 2015\n\n\n--- Page 29 ---\n\nExternal Review \n\nWhilst we recommend that complainants use the AEC internal review process in the first \ninstance, all complainants have the right to seek an external review if they are dissatisfied \nwith the process used to investigate their complaint or with our response, or if they remain \ndissatisfied following the conduct of a review.  \n\nThe conduct of any external review will be undertaken according to the policy and \nprocedures of the relevant organisation or body. The Policy outlines some options for \nexternal review, and the AEC’s responsibility to cooperate with legal requirements of any \nexternal review.  \n\nGeneral advice, such as the options available for external review, may be provided to \ncomplainants seeking an external review, however, you are not to enter into any \ndiscussion about whether any external body will accept a request for a review or what the \npossible response could be from any external review process.    \n\nPage 28    Complaints Management Procedures | 2015\n\n\n--- Page 30 ---\n\nReporting arrangements \n\nProperly managing complaints is not just about dealing with and resolving individual \ncomplaints but it is also important in helping to deliver AEC services and to evaluate and \nmake continuous improvement in the delivery. \n\nMonitoring performance   \nThe Policy outlines the AEC’s commitment to monitoring our performance in managing \ncomplaints against the set service standards. This will be achieved by: \n\nRegular review of complaints management data \nThe complaints information in the Tool is subject to ongoing review by all business areas \nwith regard to the content of complaints but also AEC staff performance in meeting the set \nservice standards. The Public Engagement Team in NO Education and Communications \nBranch will provide oversight for this through the reporting arrangements outlined below, \nbut all managers are independently required to establish regular mechanism to monitor \nperformance in their business area.  \n\nSampling of complainants \nThe AEC will also at least once in each calendar year contact a sample of complainants to \nseek their external feedback on how we managed their complaint. Complainants who \nmake a complaint via the complaints form on our website are advised that the AEC may \ncontact them for feedback about how we managed their complaint.  At this time, \ncomplainants who make a complaint via post, phone, social media or in person will not \nform part of this feedback.     \n\nNon-election complaints reporting arrangements  \nThe reporting listed below is coordinated by the Public Engagement Team but requires \nthe assistance of all staff through the consistent and accurate recording of complaints \ndata in the Tool, and the assistance of other NO areas that manage specialist types of \n\ncomplaints.  \n\nThese arrangements will be reviewed in its first year of operation, and any changes will be \nupdated in the Procedures. \n\nQuantitative monthly reports \nA monthly report on the number of complaints recorded in the Tool will be provided to \nAssistant Commissioner Education and Communications.  \n\nThis report will provide for each month: \n• \n• \n\nthe overall number of complaints recorded in the Tool \n\nbreakdown by complaint categories, channels for receipt, state/territory  \n\nPage 29    Complaints Management Procedures | 2015\n\n\n--- Page 31 ---\n\n• \n• \n\ncomparison of overall number to previous months \n\ndetection of any key recurring issues.   \n\nFollowing the identification of a key issue, the Assistant Commissioner Education and \nCommunications will provide the report to the relevant state/territory managers or NO \nbranch manager with responsibility for the business area the issue relates to. \n\nConsolidated quarterly reports \nA quarterly report on complaints management over the previous quarter will be provided \nto the Operational Compliance Group. This report will provide for that quarter: \n• \n\nthe overall number of complaints recorded in the Tool, consolidated with complaints \nrecorded in the Legal register \n\n• \n• \n• \n• \n\nbreakdown by complaint categories, channels for receipt,  state/territory  \n\ncomparison of overall number to previous quarter \n\nfeedback from the sampling of complainants feedback (if undertaken in the quarter) \n\ndetection of any key recurring issues. \n\nAnnual reporting \nA consolidated financial year report will be provided to meet the legislative requirement to \nreport on complaint management within each financial year within the agency’s annual \nreport.  \n\nElectoral event complaints reporting arrangements  \nDuring an electoral event, the reporting of public complaints will be integrated into the \nElection dashboard and closely monitored by the Public Engagement Team. The number \nand nature of complaints will also be integrated into the post-event evaluations and \n\nincorporated in Public Engagement Team Quarterly reporting. \n\nBusiness improvements \n\nIdentification of business improvements \nThe provision of the complaints reporting provides an accurate and regular mechanism for \nthe analysis of complaints data. This will assist the AEC to detect any systemic issues, to \nactively inform service delivery and identify potential business improvements. The \nresponsibility for the analysis and implementation of improvements lies with the relevant \nbusiness area. \n\nInternal communications \nKey examples of the input of complaints data into identifying business improvements will \nbe highlighted to AEC staff through intranet news features. \n\nPage 30    Complaints Management Procedures | 2015\n\n\n--- Page 32 ---\n\nAttachment A  \n\nTemplate acknowledgement and response documents \n\n1.
