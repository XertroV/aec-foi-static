These documents include:\n*   A detailed letter regarding methodology from the ABS to the AEC (8 August 1996).\n*   A letter from the AEC to the ABS (28 August 1996).\n*   A letter and sample table from the ABS to the AEC (4 September 1996).\n*   An internal AEC minute approving the methodology policy (9 September 1996).\n*   Another letter from the ABS to the AEC (29 October 1996).\n\nThe main content of these documents, as indicated by their descriptions and dates, outlines the collaborative process between the ABS and AEC in establishing the AEC's membership testing methodology during 1996. This involved the ABS providing expert advice and detailed information, the AEC engaging with this advice, and subsequently approving an internal methodology policy based on or influenced by the ABS's recommendations. The documents represent a historical exchange on the foundational aspects of the AEC's membership testing approach. No documents relating to the \"most recent advice\" were provided in the visible portion of these released pages.\n\nProvide only the markdown formatted summary text. Do not include any conversational filler or preamble."
