            "text": "## Summary of Document 30 and its Relevance to the FOI Request\n\nDocument 30 is a letter from the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) dated September 2022, informing an applicant that their request for a review of the decision to deregister VOTEFLUX.ORG | Upgrade Democracy! (VFUD) has been declined.\n\nThe AEC's primary reason for declining the review was that the applicant was not deemed a \"person affected by\" the delegate's deregistration decision, as required by section 141(2) of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918. The AEC determined that merely being an enrolled elector, a member of the general public, or expressing dissatisfaction with the decision was insufficient to establish the necessary connection or particular consequence. The applicant had cited a VFUD website article and general agreement with the party's claims of unfair deregistration as their basis for the review request, but provided no evidence of specific ties to VFUD (e.g., as a member).\n\nThe letter confirms that the delegate's decision to deregister VFUD was made on 24 March 2022. It notes that the delegate considered the results of membership testing on two lists provided by VFUD: 1,649 names on 7 December 2021 and 4,680 names on 13 February 2022. The AEC also states that it has received other applications for review of VFUD's deregistration from individuals it considers \"persons affected\" by the decision, and the outcome of those reviews will be published. The applicant is advised of their right to seek review of this specific decision (that they are not a \"person affected\") by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT).\n\n### Relevance to the FOI Request:\n\nThis document directly relates to the FOI request by providing administrative context to the deregistration of VFUD. It confirms key dates and details surrounding the process:\n*   It establishes the delegate's deregistration decision date as 24 March 2022.\n*   It corroborates the involvement of the two membership lists mentioned in the FOI overview (the 7 December 2021 list of 1,649 names and the 13 February 2022 list of 4,680 names) as integral to the delegate's original decision.\n*   While not detailing the specific reasons for deregistration (e.g., methodology flaws), the document demonstrates that the deregistration was contested and led to multiple attempts at administrative review, highlighting the contentious nature of the AEC's decision and the party's subsequent efforts to challenge it. It shows the process for review and the AEC's criteria for eligibility for such reviews."

  "prompt": "Considering this document as part of an FOI request, summarize the document and its relevance to the FOI request in markdown format. Provide only the markdown formatted summary text. Do not include any conversational filler or preamble.To aid you, the overview of the FOI request is: [REQUEST OVERVIEW START] The FOI request concerned the deregistration of the political party VOTEFLUX.ORG | Upgrade Democracy! (VFUD) by the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) for failing to meet the mandatory 1,500-member threshold. This decision stemmed from VFUD's submitted membership lists failing the AEC's statistical testing methodology, which the party contended was fundamentally flawed, particularly after a procedural error saw the delegate non-randomly test only 1,650 names from a larger 4,680-member list. During the subsequent internal review, the AEC Commission affirmed the deregistration, critically acknowledging that the delegate's non-random testing of the second list was a \"departure from the methodology\" and placed \"no weight\" on its results. However, the deregistration was upheld based on the definitive failure of VFUD's *first* membership test and the party's subsequent failure to provide a properly testable list within the AEC's established, resource-constrained methodology.\n [REQUEST OVERVIEW END] \n\n--- MAIN DOCUMENT TEXT START ---\n\n\n\n--- Page 1 ---\n\nDocument No 30\n\nAEC reference: LEX1984 \n\nBy email: \n\nDear \n\nRequest for review of decision under s 141 of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 \n\n1.\n\n2.\n\nThe Australian Electoral Commission (‘the Commission’) refers to your email dated\n6 May 2022, in which you requested that the Commission review the delegate’s\ndecision to deregister VOTEFLUX.ORG | Upgrade Democracy! (VFUD) under\nsection 137(6) of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 (‘Electoral Act’).\n\nThis letter is to notify you that the Commission has decided that it is unable to review\nthe delegate’s decision at your request.\n\nYour application \n\n3.\n\n4.\n\n5.\n\nOn 6 May 2022, the Commission Secretariat received an email from you, requesting\na review of the delegate’s decision to deregister VFUD under section 137(6) of the\nElectoral Act (‘delegate’s decision’).\n\nIn your email, you stated that you were linked to an article on VFUD’s website “via\none of their communication channels: https://www.voteflux.org/2022/04/20/wrongful-\nderegistration/” and agreed with the reasoning in that article for VFUD’s belief that\n“their deregistration was unfair/unjust”. You also stated that “there is no reason not to\npoll the list of active memberships extensively to reach the firmest result” and that\nVFUD “pose a plausible attempt at contesting the status quo and creating a better life\nfor all Australians”.\n\nThe Commission notes that no action could lawfully be undertaken regarding your\napplication from 11 April 2022 when the writs were issued for the recent federal\nelection until writs were returned on 23 June 2022.\n\nPage 1 \n\ns 47F (Personal Privacy)s 47F (Personal Privacy)s 47F (Personal Privacy)s 47F (Personal Privacy)\n\n\n--- Page 2 ---\n\nDecision \n\n6. \n\nThe Commission has considered your request and has decided that the Commission \nis unable to review the delegate’s decision at your request, because you are not a \nperson “affected by” the delegate’s decision within the meaning of section 141(2) of \nthe Electoral Act.  \n\nMaterial taken into account \n\n7. \n\nIn making this decision, the Commission has had regard to the material before it, \nincluding: \n\n(a)  your email dated 6 May 2022 requesting a review of the delegate’s decision;  \n\n(b)  the delegate’s decision and notice dated 24 March 2022 setting out her \n\nreasons for that decision; \n\n(c) the material and other information before the delegate in making the \n\ndelegate’s decision, including the list of 1,649 names provided by VFUD on \n7 December 2021 (7 December 2021 list); the list of 4,680 names provided \nby VFUD under cover of a letter dated 13 February 2022 (13 February 2022 \nlist); and the results of membership testing of the 7 December 2021 list and \nthe 13 February 2022 list set out at [16]-[24] of the delegate’s reasons for \ndecision; \n\n(d) correspondence between the Commission Secretariat and you, including the \nemails sent by the Commission Secretariat to you dated 24 June 2022 and \n4 July 2022; \n\n(e)  Part XI of the Electoral Act, in particular section 141.  \n\nSection 141 of the Electoral Act  \n\n8. \n\nSection 141(2) of the Electoral Act provides for making an application to the \nCommission for review of a “reviewable decision”. A decision to deregister a political \nparty under s 137(6) of the Electoral Act is a “reviewable decision”. \n\n9. \n\nSections 141(2) and 141(3) of the Electoral Act require the application: \n\n• be in writing; \n• be made to the Commission; \n• specify an address of the applicant; and  \n• include reasons for making the application.  \n\nYour request for review met these requirements. \n\nPage 2\n\n\n--- Page 3 ---\n\n10. \n\nIn addition, section 141(2) provides that an application can only be made: \n\n• by a person affected by the decision who is dissatisfied with the \n\ndecision; and \n\n• within the period of 28 days after the day on which the decision first \n\ncomes to the notice of the person, or within such further period as the \nCommission (either before or after the expiration of that period) \nallows. \n\n11. \n\nBy an email dated 24 June 2022, the Commission Secretariat advised you that the \nwrit for the recent election had been returned; that the Commission was therefore \nable to process your request; and that if you wished to submit an updated application \nor additional material, you were able to do so. By a further email dated 4 July 2022, \nthe Commission Secretariat specifically referred to the statutory requirements in \nsection 141(2) and invited you to provide such further submissions or comments as \nyou wished. The Commission notes that the Commission Secretariat received no \nresponse to its emails of 24 June 2022 and 4 July 2022. \n\n12.  On the material before it, the Commission is not satisfied that you are a person \n\n“affected by” the decision within the meaning of section 141(2) of the Electoral Act, \nalthough it accepts that you are dissatisfied with that decision. \n\n13. \n\n14. \n\n15. \n\nThe term “person affected” is not defined in the Electoral Act and has not received \njudicial consideration in the context of electoral law. Judicial consideration of the term \nin other contexts indicates that the meaning of the term in section 141(2) of the \nElectoral Act is referable to Part XI of the Electoral Act, having regard to the subject, \nscope and purpose of the Act as a whole. \n\nYour email of 6 May 2022 shows that you are dissatisfied with the delegate’s decision \nto deregister VFUD under section 137(6) of the Electoral Act, but this does not \nestablish that you are a person “affected by” the delegate’s decision within the \nmeaning of section 141(2) of the Electoral Act. \n\nThe Commission is of the view that a person is not “affected by” a decision to which \nsection 141(2) applies simply because the person is an elector enrolled on the \nCommonwealth Electoral Roll or a member of the Australian general public. The \nmaterial before the Commission does not indicate that you have any particular \nconnection to the delegate’s decision or to VFUD (for example, as a member of the \nParty). This material does not indicate that the delegate’s decision would have any \nparticular consequence for you other than as an elector or member of the public. \nHaving regard to the terms of section 141(2), Part XI of the Electoral Act and the Act \nas a whole, the Commission has concluded that this is not sufficient to make you a \nperson “affected by” the delegate’s decision for the purpose of section 141(2) of the \nElectoral Act.  \n\nPage 3\n\n\n--- Page 4 ---\n\n16. \n\n17. \n\nAccordingly, the Commission is of the view that you are not a “person affected” by \nthe delegate’s decision to deregister VFUD under section 137(6) of the Electoral Act \nand that you are therefore not eligible to apply for a review of that decision under \nsection 141 of the Electoral Act. \n\nOther matters \n\nThe Commission notes that the Commission Secretariat has received other \napplications for review of the delegate’s decision to deregister VFUD from two other \nindividuals who contest the delegate’s decision for the same or similar reasons to \nyour own. The Commission accepts that these individuals are “persons affected” by \nthe delegate’s decision and otherwise eligible to apply for a review of the delegate’s \ndecision. The Commission proposes to publish the outcome of its review of the \ndelegate’s decision on the AEC website. \n\nStatement of review rights \n\n18. \n\nA statement of review rights in respect of this decision is enclosed.  \n\nPage 4\n\n\n--- Page 5 ---\n\nYours sincerely, \n\nThe Hon Justice Susan Kenny AM  \n\nChairperson \n\nSeptember 2022 \n\nMr Tom Rogers \n\nElectoral Commissioner \n\nSeptember 2022 \n\nDr David Gruen AO \n\nAustralian Statistician  \n(non-judicial member) \n\nSeptember 2022 \n\nPage 5\n\n\n--- Page 6 ---\n\nYour review rights \n\nUnder s 141(5) of the Electoral Act, a person (including an organisation) affected by the \nCommission’s decision who is dissatisfied with the decision may make an application to the \nAdministrative Appeals Tribunal (‘the AAT’) for review of the decision.  \n\nHow is an application made to the AAT for a review of a Commission decision? \n\nIn accordance with s 29 of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975, the application \nmust: \n\n(a)  be made in writing; \n\n(b)  be accompanied by any prescribed fee; \n\n(c)  contain a statement of reasons for the application; and  \n\n(d)  be made within the prescribed time. \n\nThe application should also: \n\n(a)  specify the name of the applicant; and \n\n(b)  include an address at which documents in relation to the AAT proceedings \n\nmay be given.  \n\nMore information on how to apply to the AAT can be found on the AAT website: \nhttps://www.aat.gov.au/apply-for-a-review.    \n\nPrescribed fee \n\nThe AAT’s standard application fee is $962.
