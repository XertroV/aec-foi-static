            "text": "This document, an \"APS1 Induction and training booklet\" (February 2022), details the Australian Electoral Commission's (AEC) expectations for new staff, directly addressing policies on staff conduct and public engagement relevant to FOI Request LEX3437.\n\n**Staff Adherence to APS Values, Employment Principles, and Code of Conduct:**\nThe booklet outlines the AEC's core values (Electoral Integrity, Quality, Agility, Professionalism) and commitments (\"every task matters,\" \"Ballot paper principles\"), providing specific \"I statements\" to guide expected behaviours. It explicitly covers the Australian Public Service (APS) Values (ICARE: Impartial, Committed to service, Accountable, Respectful, Ethical) and the APS Code of Conduct (s13 of the Public Service Act 1999), listing 13 behavioural requirements. The document states that breaches of the Code of Conduct can result in sanctions up to termination. Mandatory eLearning courses for new staff (e.g., Protective Security Awareness, Fraud Awareness, Privacy Awareness, IT Security) are prescribed to reinforce these standards. Furthermore, it details policies on the private use of IT systems and social media, emphasizing political impartiality and upholding the AEC's reputation. Strict privacy and security responsibilities are highlighted, including rules against unauthorized access to or disclosure of personal information and the requirement to report such mishandling.\n\n**Limitations on Staff Telephone Communication with the Public:**\nThe document provides guidelines for APS1 staff handling public inquiries, including telephone communication. It stresses \"Quality client service\" principles, such as taking a positive, helpful approach, maintaining up-to-date knowledge, and aiming for timely resolution (phone calls to be answered within 90 seconds). For straightforward inquiries, staff are expected to resolve them at the first point of contact and record details. However, significant limitations are placed on information disclosure: staff must never disclose personal information from an elector's record over the phone unless they have confirmed they are speaking to that individual (by asking for identifying information, not offering it). Complex inquiries, requests for enrolment record details in writing, and all inquiries from political parties, candidates, or officials (e.g., police officers, lawyers) seeking information or copies of enrolment records must be immediately referred to a supervisor or the Divisional Returning Officer and logged in the Public Engagement Contact Tool.\n\n**Memoranda of Understanding (MOUs) with the Australian Federal Police (AFP):**\nThis document does not contain any information pertaining to Memoranda of Understanding with the Australian Federal Police (AFP)."

It provides information, tips and \nexpectations for APS1s in their role with the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC).  \n\nA list of training can be found at Attachment A and a list of resources is located at Attachment B of \nthis booklet. \n\nThe audience for this document is all APS1s. \n\n Page 3 \n\nAPS1 Induction and training booklet\n\n\n--- Page 5 ---\n\nAbout the AEC \n\nThe AECâ€™s purpose \n\nThe Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) is an independent statutory authority established by the \nAustralian Government and our purpose is to: \n\nMaintain an impartial and independent electoral system for eligible voters through active \nelectoral roll management, efficient delivery of polling services and targeted education \nand public awareness programs \n\nWe do this by: \n\nâ–   ensuring confidence in the Commonwealth electoral roll \n\nâ–   conducting successful electoral events, including federal elections, by-elections, \n\nreferendums and industrial elections and ballots \n\nâ–   undertaking public awareness activities \n\nâ–  \n\nregulating political party registrations and financial disclosure \n\nâ–   supporting electoral redistributions1. \n\nStructure of the AEC \n\nThree tier structure \n\nThe AEC has a three-tier structure: \n\nâ–   a national office in Canberra \n\nâ–   state and territory offices, and \n\nâ–   divisional offices. \n\nNational office \n\nThere are three divisions in the national office â€“ the Service Delivery Division, the Enabling and \nRegulation Division and the Organisational Transformation Division â€“ headed by the agency's three \nfirst assistant commissioners. The First Assistant Commissioner, Service Delivery Division is the \nNational Election Manager. \n\n1 AEC Corporate Plan 2021-22: https://www.aec.gov.au/About_AEC/Publications/corporate-plan/index.htm  \n\n Page 4 \n\nAPS1 Induction and training booklet\n\n\n--- Page 6 ---\n\nState offices \n\nState offices are located in each state capital. The Northern Territory office is in Darwin. The \nAustralian Capital Territory (ACT) is managed by the NSW State Manager except during election \nperiods, when an Australian Electoral Officer (AEO) for the ACT is appointed. \n\nDivisional offices \n\nDivisional offices are responsible for electoral administration within each electoral division, which \nincludes the conduct of elections, management of the electoral roll and carrying out public awareness \nactivities. Some divisions are located in a standalone office, while others are co-located with other \ndivisions and operate as larger work units. \n\nElectoral divisions are also known as electorates. There are 151 electoral divisions in Australia, and \neach electoral division is represented by a member of the House of Representatives.  \n\nThe AEC values and commitments \n\nThe AECâ€™s values of electoral integrity through quality, agility and professionalism, supported by the \norganisational commitment to the ballot paper principles and every task matters principle, were first \nintroduced in February 2015. \n\nSince then, the AEC values and commitments have been a fundamental part of the AEC; forming a \nvalues and behaviours framework that has underpinned everything the AEC does as individuals and \nas an organisation. \n\nDefining the AEC values \n\nEach value has been defined to support all staff in having a common understanding of what each \nvalue means. The definition for each value is written as a â€˜We statementâ€™ to reflect its connection to \nthe AECâ€™s purpose and vision: \n\nOur purpose is to maintain an impartial and independent electoral system for eligible voters \nthrough active electoral roll management, efficient delivery of polling services, and targeted \neducation and public awareness programs. \n\nOur vision â€“ We are a leader in refining and delivering best practice in election management. \n\nThe definitions are supported by I statements that provide examples of what each value looks like in \naction (i.e. a guide of the behaviours expected of AEC staff). These statements will help staff identify \nand promote behaviours around the workplace that demonstrate Electoral \nIntegrity through Professionalism, Agility, and Quality. \n\nA spotlight on each value, can be found on the AEC values launch page on the Intranet. \n\nElectoral integrity \n\nWe provide electoral services to deliver the franchise \n\nWe are neutral, transparent, and accountable in the preparation and conduct of electoral processes \n\nWe provide voters and stakeholders with confidence in the conduct and result of an election \n\nWhat does this look like in the AEC? \n\nâ–  \n\nâ–  \n\n Page 5 \n\nI maintain political neutrality and impartiality \n\nI respect and protect the privacy of an electorâ€™s personal information \n\nAPS1 Induction and training booklet\n\n\n--- Page 7 ---\n\nâ–  \n\nâ–  \n\nâ–  \n\nâ–  \n\nâ–  \n\nI uphold the integrity of the electoral roll at all times \n\nI uphold the sanctity of the ballot paper in all its forms and at all times \n\nI provide accurate information to stakeholders and work to correct any misunderstanding that \nmay occur \n\nI ensure my actions reflect positively on the reputation of the AEC \n\nI consider the integrity of electoral process in every task and how my conduct can impact the \nintegrity of the election \n\nâ–  \n\nI follow policies and procedures to support delivery of tasks related to elections administration \n\nQuality \n\nWe maintain the highest possible standards and continue to improve upon best practice while \nconsidering the needs of our users, stakeholders and clients \n\nWe understand that no matter how small a task is, it has the potential to impact the reputation of the \nAEC, our stakeholders, and electors \n\nWhat does this look like in the AEC? \n\nâ–  \n\nâ–  \n\nâ–  \n\nâ–  \n\nâ–  \n\nâ–  \n\nI commit to consistently achieving the highest standard of work \n\nI ensure the information and advice I provide is accurate and timely \n\nI am aware that no matter how small or insignificant a task appears to be, it has the potential \nto impact the AEC, our stakeholders, and our customers \n\nI respond positively and constructively to feedback and guidance on my performance \n\nI acknowledge that robust and transparent information management drives quality business \noutcomes \n\nI collect, use and disclose personal information in strict compliance with the Australian Privacy \nPrinciples \n\nAgility \n\nWe embrace and respond positively to the dynamic and complex environment in which we operate \n\nWe will anticipate, adapt and respond to change and welcome new ways of working. \n\nWhat does this look like in the AEC? \n\nâ–  \n\nâ–  \n\nâ–  \n\nâ–  \n\nâ–  \n\nâ–  \n\nâ–  \n\nI adapt and respond to change and ask for help when it is needed. \n\nI stay calm and focused when working under pressure and in difficult situations. \n\nI provide workable solutions to solve immediate problems and I identify and escalate more \ncomplex problems that may impact on my tasks \n\nI maintain an awareness of the work of other business areas and adapt to changing priorities \nas required. \n\nI share my knowledge and information with team members and staff \n\nI work collaboratively with teams on shared problems and initiatives \n\nI identify lessons to be learned or opportunities for innovation in my work \n\n Page 6 \n\nAPS1 Induction and training booklet\n\n\n--- Page 8 ---\n\nProfessionalism \n\nWe deliver our work to the highest standards, using our knowledge and skills to provide excellent \nservice in all areas of our work \n\nWe continue to develop a high performing, capable and responsive AEC workforce \n\nWe show respect and courtesy to our colleagues and to our stakeholders \n\nWhat does this look like in the AEC? \n\nâ–  \n\nâ–  \n\nâ–  \n\nâ–  \n\nâ–  \n\nâ–  \n\nâ–  \n\nI conduct myself in a cordial and respectful manner with colleagues, customers and \nstakeholders at all times. \n\nI respond and anticipate client needs in a timely, professional and helpful matter. \n\nI keep up to date with information and new processes relevant to my role. I act honestly and \nethically and encourage others to do the same. \n\nI seek opportunities to develop and learn, taking responsibility for my own personal \ndevelopment \n\nI respectfully challenge behaviour that is inconsistent with organisational values, standards of \nthe APS Code of Conduct. \n\nI recognise and value the contribution of others. \n\nI follow through reliably and take personal responsibility for my actions and decisions and their \nconsequences. \n\nâ–  \n\nI take pride in doing my job well \n\nEvery task matters \n\nWe have a mantra at the AEC that â€˜every task mattersâ€™, so it is expected that all staff conduct AEC \nbusiness in a professional manner - regardless of the task, no matter how big or how small. It is \ncritical that staff follow all AEC procedures at all times; delivering high quality electoral events that \nare transparent and uphold the AECâ€™s reputation as a leading electoral management body.  \n\nBallot paper principles \n\nThe AEC upholds the sanctity of the ballot paper in all its forms and at all times. This is given effect \nthrough two principles: \n\nâ–   All ballot papers remain â€˜liveâ€™ from printing through to statutorily authorised destruction. \n\nâ–   The security, integrity and accountability of ballot papers must be preserved at all times â€“ \n\nincluding transit and storage by the AEC, contractors, or other third parties. \n\nThese principles underpin all AEC planning, training, systems, handling and practices associated \nwith ballot papers. They show how important ballot paper security is and provides a basis for the \ntreatment of every ballot paper from printing to destruction by anyone who handles ballot papers, \nincluding but not limited to staff, polling officials and contractors.  \n\nVisual representation of the values and commitments \n\nThe values and commitments are captured in one visual representation (see below) to frame and \nguide how we work and underpin everything we do. This is displayed in all AEC offices and should \nact as a daily reminder of the importance of modelling these core values. It is important to continually \ntalk about the values and commitments and how they apply to you as an individual and as an \norganisation.  \n\n Page 7 \n\nAPS1 Induction and training booklet\n\n\n--- Page 9 ---\n\nPage 8 \n\nAPS1 Induction and training booklet\n\n\n--- Page 10 ---\n\nAustralian Public Service (APS) Values and Code of Conduct \n\nThe AEC is committed to providing a respectful workplace that supports a positive work environment, \nfree from inappropriate behaviour.  \n\nThe APS values set out the parliamentâ€™s expectations, behaviours and performance standards of \nstaff working in the APS. You must at all times ensure your behaviours meet these standards which \ncan be remembered by the acronym ICARE. \n\nThe APS values \n\nImpartial \n\nThe APS is apolitical and provides the government with advice that is frank, honest, \ntimely and based on the best available evidence. \n\nCommitted to service \n\nThe APS is professional, objective, innovative and efficient, and works collaboratively \nto achieve the best results for the Australian community and the government. \n\nAccountable  \n\nThe APS is open and accountable to the Australian community under the law and \nwithin the framework of ministerial responsibility. \n\nRespectful  \n\nThe APS respects all people, including their rights and their heritage. \n\nEthical \n\nThe APS demonstrates leadership, is trustworthy, and acts with integrity, in all that it \ndoes. \n\nThe APS Code of Conduct is set out in s13 of the Public Service Act 1999 and lists the expected \nbehaviours and actions required of all staff working in the APS. This is not about how well you do \nyour job, but how you behave when undertaking your role. \n\nA breach of the Code of Conduct can result in sanctions, ranging from a reprimand to termination of \nemployment. \n\nThe Code of Conduct can be found on the following page. A brochure with more information is \navailable on the APSC website: https://www.apsc.gov.au/publication/aps-values-and-code-conduct-\npractice  \n\n Page 9 \n\nAPS1 Induction and training booklet\n\n\n--- Page 11 ---\n\nThe Code of Conduct \n\nThe Code of Conduct requires that an APS employee must: \n\nï‚·  behave honestly and with integrity in connection with APS employment; \n\nï‚·  act with care and diligence in connection with APS employment; \n\nï‚·  when acting in connection with APS employment, treat everyone with respect \n\nand courtesy, and without harassment; \n\nï‚·  when acting in connection with APS employment, comply with all applicable \n\nAustralian laws; \n\nï‚·  comply with any lawful and reasonable direction given by someone in the \n\nemployee's Agency who has authority to give the direction; \n\nï‚·  maintain appropriate confidentiality about dealings that the employee has with \n\nany Minister or Minister's member of staff; \n\nï‚· \n\ntake reasonable steps to avoid any conflict of interest (real or apparent) and \ndisclose details of any material personal interest of the employee in \nconnection with the employee's APS employment; \n\nï‚·  use Commonwealth resources in a proper manner and for a proper purpose; \n\nï‚·  not provide false or misleading information in response to a request for \ninformation that is made for official purposes in connection with the \nemployee's APS employment; \n\nï‚·  not improperly use inside information or the employee's duties, status, power \n\nor authority: \n\n1.  to gain, or seek to gain, a benefit or an advantage for the employee or \n\nany other person; or \n\n2.  to cause, or to seek to cause, detriment to the employee's Agency, the \n\nCommonwealth or any other person.  \n\nï‚·  at all times behave in a way that upholds the APS Values and Employment \nPrinciples, and the integrity and good reputation of the employee's Agency \nand the APS; \n\nï‚·  while on duty overseas, at all times behave in a way that upholds the good \n\nreputation of Australia; and \n\nï‚·  comply with any other conduct requirement that is prescribed by the \n\nregulations (regulations available on the ComLaw website). \n\nThe Code of Conduct is set out in section 13 of the Public Service Act 1999. \n\n Page 10 \n\nAPS1 Induction and training booklet\n\n\n--- Page 12 ---\n\nAPS1 Administration Assistant \n\nAbout your role \n\nAn APS1 Administration Assistant is a casual staff member, usually located in a divisional, state or \nterritory office or at an out-posted centre. Your primary role is to provide administrative and \nprocessing support to the office during peak workload periods. You have been employed to provide \nadministrative support to your office in the lead up to, and during, the next federal election. The work \nyou will be doing is vitally important to the delivery of a successful election, and we will train and \nsupport you to do your tasks well. \n\nWe aim to give you as much notice as we can, but during the election you may be asked to stay at \nwork to complete a task at short notice. You should also expect to work a number of weekends \nduring the election period. \n\nDuties \n\nYour duties will include: \n\nâ–   handling counter and telephone enquiries \n\nâ–   checking and responding to emails \n\nâ–   preparing routine correspondence using automated systems \n\nâ–   performing photocopying, scanning, collating and mailing documents \n\nâ–   processing enrolment forms from clients applying to enrol or updating their \n\nexisting enrolment details \n\nâ–   helping to maintain the address register \n\nâ–   handling postal vote applications and returned postal vote certificates (during an \n\nelection) \n\nâ–   processing declaration vote envelopes to determine if the voter is able to have \n\ntheir vote counted (during an election) \n\nâ–   other tasks and projects as directed. \n\nPerformance plan \n\nIt is a requirement for all Australian Government employees (ongoing and non-ongoing) to have an \nindividual performance plan (IPP). An IPP is linked to organisational and business goals and \nmaintains the APS and AEC values. It also provides employees with a clear statement of \nperformance expectations. \n\nYour manager will meet with you to put your IPP in place and will advise if it will be done through the \nAurion Employee Self Service (ESS) facility or the IPP agreement and review paper form. \n\nAgile pool \n\nYou may be working in an agile pool of staff. This means that for certain tasks or projects you work \non, you may be required to report to someone other than your line manager. Your line manager will \nremain your point of contact for your timesheets, individual performance plan and any other matters. \n\n Page 11 \n\nAPS1 Induction and training booklet\n\n\n--- Page 13 ---\n\nTraining \n\nThe AECâ€™s approach to learning is based on the 70:20:10 model. This is an approach where: \n\nâ–   70 per cent of learning is from experience â€“ typically on the job experience and practice. \nStaff have access to self-directed learning tools, such as videos, asking the community, \nsimulations, blogs, job aids and knowledge management systems. Staff benefit from short \nterm secondments, job rotations and projects. \n\nâ–   20 per cent of learning is from others - both formal and informal coaching and mentoring \nfrom others, including participation in expert networks, forums and communities of practice. \n\nâ–   10 per cent of learning is structured - formal learning interventions and structured programs \n\nthat can involve assessment, accreditation and a mix of classroom and eLearning. \n\nMandatory eLearning courses  \n\nA list of all mandatory eLearning courses that are required to be completed within the first four weeks \nof commencing duties with the AEC is located at Attachment A. These eLearning courses can be \naccessed and completed via AEC Learning.  \n\nOther training resources \n\nThere are also a number of optional training resources listed in Attachment A that provide context \naround various election activities. These courses should be completed at the discretion of your \nsupervisor.  \n\nYour supervisor will work closely with you as you begin to work on real enrolment forms and check \nyour work to ensure they are satisfied with your learning. Where necessary, or if you request it, \naspects of the training can be covered again until you are managing your work confidently and with \nsuccess. \n\nWe undertake quality assurance processes, such as the Enrolment Quality Assurance Program \n(EQAP) to identify any enrolment processing errors. This will also help inform your learning progress, \nand we will discuss with you any errors or issues identified through the program. \n\n Page 12 \n\nAPS1 Induction and training booklet\n\n\n--- Page 14 ---\n\nUseful information \n\nTimesheets \n\nThe Aurion Employee Self Service (ESS) facility is the system used to submit your timesheets. You \ncan consult the Aurion ESS intranet page for user guides, forms and FAQs. Your supervisor will \nadvise if you are required to use Aurion ESS to manage your timesheets. \n\nWorkplace health and safety \n\nThe AEC strives to maintain a workplace environment that demonstrably values health, safety and \nwellbeing. \n\nYour supervisor will ensure you take regular breaks, and you must take a break after five consecutive \nhours of duty. If you feel you are not being given sufficient breaks, raise this with your supervisor. \n\nAEC employees are also required to take reasonable care for their own health and safety and to \nensure their own acts or omissions do not adversely affect others. You are required to follow \nreasonable instructions given by the AEC, and all AEC policies and procedures on Workplace Health \nand Safety.  \n\nVisit the Health, Safety and Wellbeing page on the intranet for more information. \n\nFatigue management \n\nFatigue is a state of mental and/or physical exhaustion which reduces a person's ability to perform \ntasks safely and effectively. \n\nThe AEC aims to create a safe and healthy work environment for all its workers, and prevent, as far \nas is reasonably practicable, fatigue affecting its workers. Fatigue is an ever-present risk in the AEC, \nin particular during election periods, and can't always be prevented, but must always be managed.  \n\nImproving the way the AEC manages fatigue can significantly improve the performance of workers \nand teams. This improvement leads to a reduction in errors, improved workplace efficiency and the \nelimination of, or the minimisation of, health and safety risks to workers. The risks of workers \nexperiencing fatigue arise from a range of sources and for a variety of reasons and can be different \nfor each individual worker. Fatigue can be caused by work related factors, factors outside work \nand/or a combination of both and may accumulate over time.  \n\nYour supervisor will discuss fatigue management with you, and the policies and support guides \navailable. Visit the Fatigue management and prevention page on the intranet for more information. \n\nSecurity \n\nSecurity passes \n\nYou will be issued with a security pass and you must wear it at all times while you are in an AEC \noffice. You must take off your pass when outside the office. \n\n Page 13 \n\nAPS1 Induction and training booklet\n\n\n--- Page 15 ---\n\nSystems and information security \n\nWhen you start, you will be given an AEC email address and access to the AECâ€™s intranet. You must \nfollow AEC policies when using these systems, and relevant information is provided for you later in \nthis booklet. \n\nAs most of your work is systems based, you will also be given an individual login and password for \neach system you use. You are personally responsible for securing your login and password details, \nand for all activity on the systems undertaken using your login. The AEC actively monitors computer \nand systems usage. \n\nMisuse of our systems, unlawful access to the records of our clients or unlawful disclosure of \ninformation is taken very seriously by the AEC, and there are significant consequences for any \nbreach, including the possibility of legal proceedings. \n\nPrivate use of IT systems and social media \n\nYou are allowed to use the AECâ€™s computer network for private purposes, as long as it's reasonable \n(for example, internet banking). You are not permitted to access or download illicit data or \ninformation, such as pornography, hacking, peer-to-peer networking or pirated software. \n\nThe AEC has important requirements that must be adhered to when it comes to the personal use of \nsocial media. You should consider the impact of your activities on the reputation of the AEC before \nyou make a comment or produce any content on social media. Your actions online must not conflict \nwith the AECâ€™s political impartiality requirement and should not compromise public confidence in the \nagency or the APS. \n\nPersonal security \n\nEvery AEC office has an emergency warden and some offices also have a first aid officer. Your \ninduction to your local office will include information on evacuation procedures and an introduction to \nthese officers. \n\nVisitors to AEC offices who are accessing parts of the office that are not designated reception areas \nwill need to sign in, wear a visitor pass and be escorted at all times. If you notice a person in your \noffice who is not wearing a visitor pass or is not being escorted, please alert your supervisor who will \ndeal with the situation immediately. \n\nTelephone directories \n\nUp-to-date telephone directories for both divisional office staff and state office staff are available on \nthe intranet and on the local state collaboration sites. Your supervisor will show you how to navigate \nthese sites and access the telephone directories for your locality. \n\nYou can also find details about individual officers on the intranet by using the â€˜Search Peopleâ€™ facility \nin the top-right search bar, or by searching their name in Microsoft Teams. \n\nMulti-function devices and printers \n\nThe AEC uses multi-function devices (MFDs), which provide staff with the ability to copy and print \ndocuments, and to scan and send documents to an email inbox. Unless your supervisor tells you \notherwise, all of your printing must be in black and white. You will be provided with an access card to \nlog you in to the MFD â€“ this may be your building access card or a separate MFD card. \n\n Page 14 \n\nAPS1 Induction and training booklet\n\n\n--- Page 16 ---\n\nWhen printing, be conscious of paper usage, but also of the currency of the document into the future. \nDocuments like Quick Reference Guides often go out of date quickly when printed. \n\nMore information and assistance on connecting to a printer can be accessed in the AEC Service \nCentre's Knowledge Hub, through searching 'printer'. \n\nMicrosoft teams (AEC Teams) \n\nMicrosoft Teams is a communication platform where you can call, chat, meet and collaborate with \nAEC colleagues. The AEC has its own hosted implementation of Microsoft Teams, called AEC \nTEAMS. \n\nYou should use AEC TEAMS for all your collaboration needs, such as chat with colleagues, meetings \nand also live events. You have AEC TEAMS installed on your desktop ready to use. \n\nMore information and assistance on using AEC Teams can be accessed in the AEC Service Centre's \nKnowledge Hub, through searching 'Teams'. \n\n Page 15 \n\nAPS1 Induction and training booklet\n\n\n--- Page 17 ---\n\nPrivacy and security \n\nAs a government authority handling personal information, the AEC has very strict rules about privacy \nand security. Many of us have access to electorsâ€™ personal information, including some information \nthat is highly sensitive, and we must take care at all times to uphold our responsibilities. AEC staff \nmembers also have limited access to records of clients of other government agencies, and \noccasionally medical information about an individual client. \n\nLegislation \n\nWhen handling personal information AEC staff must comply with the Australian Privacy Principles \n(APPs) under the Privacy Act 1988. The purpose of the Privacy Act is to protect the privacy of \nindividuals, and to protect personal information that is collected by entities such as the AEC. \n\nAs an AEC employee accessing personal information, you are also bound by the requirements of the \nthe Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918, the Code of Conduct set out in the Public Service Act 1999 \nand the Crimes Act 1914. Unlawful access, use or disclosure of elector information by an AEC staff \nmember is a breach of the Code of Conduct and, in some cases, is also a criminal offence. \n\nThe AEC publishes the following disclosure on our website: \n\nUnder the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918, the electoral roll (containing \nnames and addresses) may be supplied to prescribed authorities, members of \nparliament, political parties, approved medical researchers, public health \nprograms and electoral researchers. It is also used to maintain joint \nCommonwealth and state and territory electoral rolls. \n\nThis disclosure is therefore authorised by law. Only authorised delegates are permitted to provide \nthat information. \n\nMishandling of personal information \n\nPreserving the security of personal information is not only about ensuring compliance with the \nrequirements of the Privacy Act 1988. The Australian Privacy Principles (APPs) outline how the AEC \nmust handle, use and manage personal information. If we mishandle the personal information of our \nclients, it can cause them damage and, in turn, it can also lead to a loss of trust and considerable \nharm to our reputation. \n\nThe community expects that their sensitive information will be given a higher level of protection than \nnon-sensitive information. This expectation is reflected in the increased privacy protections that \napply. Sensitive information could include the risk to a clientâ€™s personal safety or that of their family, a \nclientâ€™s movements overseas for work purposes (for example, for defence personnel), a clientâ€™s \ncriminal sentence or health information that identifies an individualâ€™s medical condition. \n\nThe mishandling of sensitive information may: \n\nâ–   provide the basis for discrimination or other more severe types of harm \n\nâ–  \n\nâ–  \n\n Page 16 \n\nlead to humiliation or embarrassment, or undermine an individualâ€™s dignity \n\nimpact negatively on the AECâ€™s reputation. \n\nAPS1 Induction and training booklet\n\n\n--- Page 18 ---\n\nYour responsibilities \n\nWhile employed by the AEC you must abide by all AEC privacy and security principles. You should \nalso report to your supervisor if you see a colleague doing anything that is a breach of the rules or is \nnot appropriate. \n\nâ–   You must never use AEC systems to access any enrolment record beyond the ones you need \nto process as part of your work. For example, you must never look up a friend or colleagueâ€™s \naddress, birth date or telephone number. \n\nâ–   You must never leave your computer unlocked while you are away from your workstation, \n\nregardless of how long you are away, unless you can see your workstation for the entire time. \n\nâ–   You must lock away hardcopy enrolment records as per local filing protocols, including clientsâ€™ \nmedical information, if you are away from your workstation for longer than 30 minutes and \novernight. \n\nâ–   You must never record the specifics of a clientâ€™s medical condition (for example, â€˜dementiaâ€™, \n\nâ€˜schizophreniaâ€™) in RMANS or GENESIS. \n\nâ–   You will need to use information from other government agencies (such as driverâ€™s license \n\ndetails) so check with your supervisor about the correct use of the information. \n\nâ–   When talking to a client or other member of the public, you must never disclose information \nfrom their record unless you have confirmed you are talking to that individual. To confirm, \nensure the person gives you identifying information; never offer it to them. \n\nâ–  \n\nIndividuals who want the AEC to provide details of their enrolment record in writing must \nmake the request in writing themselves, and the AEC will respond in writing. The response \nwill only be given to the individual client. You wonâ€™t be required to do this but you may be \ncalled upon to give advice to clients on this matter. \n\nâ–   Regardless of a personâ€™s official credentials (such as a police officer or lawyer), you must \nnever provide information or copies of an enrolment record, whatever the status of that \nenrolment. Log all such requests in the Public Engagement Contact Tool and refer them to \nyour supervisor. Ensure you upload any relevant documents into the Tool. \n\nâ–  \n\nIf you become aware that a staff member is mishandling personal information, for example, \naccessing personal information for any purpose outside of official AEC duties, you should \nreport the matter to a senior officer as soon as you can. \n\nMore information is available on the Privacy page on the intranet.  \n\nProtecting privacy â€“ we all play a key role \n\nPrivacy, and the proper management of personal information and data, is a critical responsibility for \nthe AEC and its staff. \n\nEvery day AEC staff handle the personal information of electors and staff with a high degree of care \nand accuracy. It is a fact though that, on occasion, mistakes occur due to human error. Any human \nerror in the management of personal information can have a real human effect on those who entrust \nus with their information. \n\nTake the time to read the Quick reference guide on Privacy in Practice to help protect privacy and \nsecure personal information. \n\n Page 17 \n\nAPS1 Induction and training booklet\n\n\n--- Page 19 ---\n\nPublic enquiries  \n\nWhen interacting with the public, AEC staff are required to follow these guidelines so we can provide \nconsistent and professional client service. \n\nQuality client service \n\nThe aim of the AECâ€™s public enquiry management is to fulfil our obligations under the AEC Service \nCharter. The Charter is a public-facing corporate document, informing the public of what to expect \nwhen interacting with the AEC and listing the reciprocated behaviours expected of the public by the \nAEC. \n\nThe AEC asks staff to: \n\nâ–  \n\ntake a positive helpful approach \n\nâ–   maintain sound and up-to-date knowledge of electoral processes \n\nâ–   consider how the client feels \n\nâ–   consider the individual circumstances of the client \n\nâ–  \n\nresolve enquiries in a timely manner. \n\nService level standards \n\nThe AEC is committed to providing timely responses, which means resolving enquiries at first point of \ncontact whenever possible. If an enquiry needs further investigation, staff should ensure the relevant \nservice level standards are met.  \n\nThe enquiry service level standards for our public contact channels are: \n\nPhone \n\nanswered within 90 seconds \n\nWalk-in \n\nacknowledged within five minutes \n\nEmail, post \n\nresponded to within five working days \n\nFurther information about the AECâ€™s service level standards can be found on the Public engagement \nand complaints management intranet page. \n\nResolving straightforward enquiries at first point of contact \n\nWhere possible, enquiries should be handled at the first point of contact by the person who initially \nreceived it and often at the same time it is received. \n\nYou should attempt to resolve an enquiry when you receive it by: \n\nâ–  \n\nâ–  \n\nlistening to the enquirer and acknowledging their concerns \n\nidentifying the issue(s) \n\nâ–   clarifying anything that is unclear \n\n Page 18 \n\nAPS1 Induction and training booklet\n\n\n--- Page 20 ---\n\nâ–   considering individual circumstances \n\nâ–   keeping it simple by limiting your use of jargon and acronyms \n\nâ–  \n\ntaking personal responsibility for resolving the enquiry. \n\nWhere appropriate, you should advise enquirers about the services available through our website: \nwww.aec.gov.au.These services include checking their enrolment, updating their details or enrolling \nfor the first time. \n\nYou must record the details of the enquiry in the Public Engagement Contact Tool, including the \nresponse provided, and mark it as â€˜resolvedâ€™. You must also attach a copy of any related \ncorrespondence.  \n\nHandling more complex enquiries \n\nComplex enquiries, or those for which the information is not reasonably able to be found, must be \nreferred to your supervisor. \n\nEnquiries from political parties, candidates and potential candidates must be referred to the Divisional \nReturning Officer as soon as possible. Record the details of the enquiry in the Public Engagement \nContact Tool, and escalate it through the tool, attaching copies of related correspondence. \n\nComplaints \n\nAll complaints are to be logged in the Public Engagement Contact Tool. \n\nYour supervisor will brief you on which complaints you can handle directly and which you should refer \nto a more senior staff member. \n\nComplaints should be acknowledged within three business days unless the matter can be resolved \nwithin three business days. If the matter needs to be referred for further advice, this must occur within \none business day to allow maximum time for the matter to be resolved by the receiving officer. \n\nComplaints are to be resolved within 10 business days. A quick guide to complaints management \nprovides further guidance on this process.  \n\nAEC email protocol \n\nEmails are the main way we send important information to each other in the AEC or request action. \nIn the course of your work, you may need to send emails to work colleagues or send responses to \nemail enquiries from members of the public, so you will need to follow these guidelines. \n\nSetting up your email signature \n\nThe AECâ€™s email system is accessed via Microsoft Outlook on your computerâ€™s desktop. Before you \nuse the email system you need to set up your email signature. This is the block of text that will \nappear at the bottom of every email you send. It lists your name, title and phone numbers. \n\nYou can update your email signature block using the My Details tool, which is available to all staff via \nthe Start Menu and All Programs. More information and assistance on updating your email \nsignature can be accessed in the AEC Service Centre's Knowledge Hub, through searching \n'signature'. \n\n Page 19 \n\nAPS1 Induction and training booklet\n\n\n--- Page 21 ---\n\nDrafting an internal email \n\nâ–  \n\nâ–  \n\nâ–  \n\nIn the TO field: address the email to those AEC officers who need the information or who \nneed to act. \n\nIn the CC field: copy the email to other AEC staff who may need to be kept informed of the \nemail request or the information being conveyed. This will usually include the relevant \nmanager(s) of the primary addressees, and your own supervisor, and other AEC staff who \nhave a need to know. If you are unsure, clarify this with your supervisor. \n\nIn the SUBJECT field: at the beginning, indicate in capital letters whether the message is \nFOR INFORMATION or FOR ACTION. Clearly state the subject. If action is required, include \na due date. \n\nWhen composing the main part of the email in the Content space, keep in mind these guidelines: \n\nâ–   Remember that all emails sent at work are documents that may be retrieved and possibly \n\ndisclosed under Freedom of Information legislation (even when an email has been deleted). \n\nâ–   The content of emails should always be drafted in a polite, business-like and factual manner. \n\nâ–   Ensure your email contains your official AEC signature block (see above for the directions to \n\nset this up). \n\nEmails responding to enquiries by members of the public \n\nIf you need to send emails in response to public enquiries, check with your supervisor about how to \naccess standard responses to common requests on the AEC intranet and set them up using the \nQuick Steps facility in Outlook. \n\nBefore sending an email \n\nâ–   Mark it with the appropriate security classification. Emails you send will either be marked as \n\nâ€˜OFFICIALâ€™ or â€˜UNOFFICIALâ€™. Check with your supervisor for the correct classification to use. \n\nâ–   Check that the recipients are correct and that if sending to multiple recipients the BCC field \n\nhas been used to protect their privacy. \n\nâ–   Ensure any attachments are correct for the intended recipient to avoid revealing personal \n\ninformation to the wrong person. \n\nâ–   Reflect on the clarity, tone and content of your message, bearing in mind all emails are \n\n Page 20 \n\nAPS1 Induction and training booklet\n\n\n--- Page 22 ---\n\npotentially disclosable in response to Freedom of Information requests. \n\nâ–   For further tips on writing, refer to the AECâ€™s style guide - AEC writing style. \n\nRecordkeeping requirements after sending \n\nIf you are the person writing an original email (and not just replying to someone), your business area \nis most likely the â€˜ownerâ€™ of the business activity or project that the email is about and it may need to \nbe filed in the AECâ€™s electronic records management system, Objective IM. Check with your \nsupervisor about whether any email correspondence you send needs to be uploaded to Objective IM. \n\nIf you are required to use ObjectiveIM you will first need to complete the Information management \nand recordkeeping eLearning course prior to accessing ObjectiveIM. You can self-enrol in this \neLearning course in AEC Learning.  \n\nThe Information and Knowledge Management (IKM) section provides instructor-led Objective training \nvia MS Teams for all new staff at the AEC. To register to attend a session search for â€˜ObjectiveIMâ€™ in \nAEC Learning. For best results learners are encouraged to attend the training as soon as possible \nafter completing the Information management and recordkeeping eLearning course. By the end of \nthe training, you will be able to do the following within Objective: \n\nâ–   understand the AEC file structure \n\nâ–   upload and edit documents \n\nâ–   search for records \n\nâ–   upload emails \n\nâ–   send and access Objective link/reference \n\nâ–  \n\nrename files and edit/view metadata. \n\nEmail etiquette \n\nUsed properly, email can assist in maintaining good working relationships, increase productivity and \nprovide efficiencies. Please follow this list of tips in your electronic communications: \n\nâ–   Communicate in clear, professional language. If in doubt, it is better to be overly formal rather \n\nthan unprofessional. \n\nâ–   Do not send anything you would not be comfortable showing to your colleagues or being seen \n\npublicly. Consider that email is more like a postcard than a sealed envelope with a letter in it. \n\nâ–   Treat email like any other business communication; pay attention to spelling and grammar. \n\nRun the spell check if need be. \n\nâ–   Re-read and check what you have written before you send it. \n\nâ–   Be concise and tactful. \n\nâ–   Break up the text by using short lines and paragraphs; this makes it easier to read. \n\nâ–   Do not write in UPPERCASE or bold, which may be perceived as shouting or telling off the \n\nrecipient. \n\nâ–   Copyright laws apply to electronic mail as well as printed media. \n\nâ–   Respond promptly to email messages â€“ even if it is just to let the sender know that you will \n\nreply in full later. \n\nRemember that all laws that apply to discrimination, defamation and harassment (verbal, emotional \nand sexual) also apply to electronic communication. \n\n Page 21 \n\nAPS1 Induction and training booklet\n\n\n--- Page 23 ---\n\nAttachment A â€“Training for APS1 staff \n\nMandatory eLearning courses \nAPS1 staff will be automatically enrolled in the below mandatory eLearning courses via AEC \nLearning and must complete them within four weeks of commencing duties.  \n\nCategory \n\nCourse name \n\nDuration \n\nWhere to find it \n\nMandatory learning \nprogram \n\nWork, Health and Safety \nProtective Security Awareness \nFraud Awareness \nPrivacy Awareness \nIT Security \nET201 Ballot Paper Handling \nCultural Appreciation \nCOVID-19 \n\n30 min \n\n30 min \n\n30 min \n\n30 min \n\n30 min \n\n30 min \n\n30 min \n\n30 min \n\nAEC Learning \n\nManager-directed self-enrolment \nSupervisors should work with APS1 staff to identify additional eLearning courses relevant to their \nduties.
