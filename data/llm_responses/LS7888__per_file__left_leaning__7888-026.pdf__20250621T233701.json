            "text": "This document, \"Analysis of Indigenous Enrolment,\" underscores critical challenges in achieving social equity and democratic accountability for First Nations peoples within Australia's electoral system. While acknowledging the importance of Indigenous enrolment for \"Closing the Gap,\" it reveals profound systemic shortcomings from a left-leaning perspective.\n\nCrucially, the document explicitly confirms the persistent absence of a direct Indigenous identifier on the federal electoral roll. This fundamental failing necessitates reliance on \"indicative only\" data and estimation methods based on \"courageous\" and \"non-trivial assumptions,\" inherently undermining the accuracy and reliability needed for genuine equity and accountability.\n\nThe AEC's reliance on sensitive Centrelink data, while presented as an \"excellent opportunity\" for improved estimation, raises significant civil liberties and privacy concerns. This approach blurs the lines between social support and civic duties, and the data itself is limited to only those Indigenous Australians who receive a Centrelink benefit and have self-identified to Centrelink, thus not capturing the full picture of Indigenous enrolments. The document even notes \"significant matching error\" for older Indigenous Australians within this dataset.\n\nFurthermore, the document exposes the limited effectiveness of the AEC's methods. An \"enrolment stimulation event\" in early 2019, targeting over 72,000 potentially unenrolled Indigenous Australians identified through Centrelink data, resulted in the enrolment of a mere 2,646 individuals. This low success rate highlights the critical absence of direct Indigenous involvement in the program's planning or design, reinforcing the need for genuine self-determination and co-designed solutions to overcome systemic barriers to First Nations' full democratic participation."

Emphasize its implications for social equity, environmental concerns, or democratic accountability. The overall FOI overview is: The Australian Electoral Commission's Indigenous Electoral Participation Program (IEPP) between 2018 and 2019 presents a mixed picture from a left-leaning perspective. While commendably recognizing and actively addressing the significant disparity in Indigenous electoral enrolment through pragmatic efforts like leveraging Centrelink data to boost participation towards \"Closing the Gap\" objectives, critical progressive shortcomings persist. A fundamental systemic failing is the continued absence of a direct Indigenous identifier on the federal roll, necessitating reliance on \"indicative only\" data. Crucially, the documents reveal no Indigenous involvement in the program's planning or design, a significant deviation from principles of self-determination and co-design. Furthermore, the extensive use of sensitive Centrelink data raises substantial civil liberties concerns regarding privacy and the blurring of lines between social support and civic duties, indicating that a deeper commitment to genuine equity and community-led solutions is still needed within this vital initiative.\n\nDocument Text:\n\nAnalysis of Indigenous Enrolment \n\nPopulation Estimates \n\nThe ABS data provided at table 1 represents the ABS estimated resident Indigenous population 1=8 \nyears and over by state as at 2016 and projected to 30 June 2019. \n\nThis data has not been adjusted by the ABS to calculate estimated Indigenous enrolment eligible \npopulation, however, table 2 provides the AEC’s estimated Indigenous voting age population as at 30 \nJune 2018. \n\nTable 1 – ABS estimated resident and projected population - Indigenous Australians - 18 \nyears and over \n\nEstimated resident and projected population, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians, Series B, 18 \nyears and over - 30 June 2016 to 2019 (see note a) \n\nState/territory \n\nEstimated \nResident \nPopulation \n\nProjected Population \n\n2016 (see note b) \n\n2017 \n\n2018 \n\n2019 \n\nACT \n\nNSW \n\nNT(b) \n\nQLD \n\nSA \n\nTas \n\nVic \n\nWA \n\nAustralia (see note c) \n\n4,670 \n\n156,172 \n\n48,180 \n\n127,492 \n\n24,991 \n\n16,991 \n\n34,289 \n\n60,733 \n\n473,710 \n\n4,886 \n\n160,403 \n\n49,282 \n\n131,166 \n\n25,719 \n\n17,471 \n\n35,457 \n\n62,544 \n\n487,121 \n\n5,089 \n\n164,510 \n\n50,464 \n\n135,141 \n\n26,507 \n\n17,986 \n\n36,645 \n\n64,451 \n\n500,988 \n\n5,273 \n\n168,896 \n\n51,674 \n\n139,306 \n\n27,207 \n\n18,489 \n\n37,839 \n\n66,335 \n\n515,215 \n\nSource:  Australian Bureau of Statistics, Estimates and Projections, Aboriginal and Torres Strait \nIslander Australians, 2006 to 2031 (cat.

Yet the resulting enrolment and turnout \nrates in particular were alarmingly low, and hopefully represented a worst case picture. \n\nAs part of the Annual Roll Integrity Review (ARIR), the person-level matching between the Roll and \nCentrelink now includes Centrelink’s Indigenous indicator. However, as Centrelink customers \nrepresent only around half of the Roll, the matching (even if perfect) would be far from assigning all \nenrolments an Indigenous flag. Nevertheless, for the first time the AEC has a very large number of \nenrolled persons, over 6 million, with an explicit Indigenous status. \n\nThe enrolment rate, even for all persons regardless of indigeneity, is difficult to calculate reliably due \nto conceptual, collection and methodological differences between the Roll (numerator) and the ABS-\nbased enrolment-eligible population (denominator, “EEP”). In the case of the Indigenous population \n\nLS7888 Released Document No. 26Released under the Freedom of Information Act 1982 \n \n \n \n \n\fthese problems are magnified by having no Indigenous identifier on the Roll and less reliable \nestimates of Indigenous EEP.  \n\nHowever, matching the Roll to Centrelink data allows a more direct method of estimating the \nIndigenous enrolment rate. \n\nIt is still subject to quite courageous assumptions, but as fewer are required it likely represents an \nimproved approach. In summary: \n\n  For all Centrelink customers with an identified Indigenous or non-Indigenous status, \n\ncalculate the proportion on the Roll. This is the raw enrolment rate of Centrelink clients. \n  Calculate the ratio of the actual AEC enrolment rate versus the Centrelink-based rate, for the \nsame point in time. This is the overall factor to adjust any Centrelink-based rates to align \nwith AEC enrolment rates. \n\n  Apply the adjustment factor to raw Centrelink-based enrolment rates by Indigenous status \n\nto give Indigenous and non-Indigenous enrolment rates. \n\n  This process can be done at the State level, though results will have lower reliability. \n\nIt should be noted that while this method avoids indirectly modelling Indigenous enrolment rates via \ngeographic association, it does assume that any bias in Centrelink clients being enrolled is equal for \nIndigenous and non-Indigenous, and that there are no substantive Indigenous-status biases inherent \nin the Roll-to-Centrelink person matching. \n\nThe Centrelink client file with Indigenous indicator newly available to the AEC has presented an \nexcellent opportunity, via matching to the Roll and mark-off data, to improve estimation of \nIndigenous franchise KPIs.  \n\nWhile the results are subject to a number of non-trivial assumptions, the more direct estimation \nmethods lead to a higher likelihood of robust results. The figures should nevertheless still be \nregarded as indicative only. \n\nLS7888 Released Document No. 26Released under the Freedom of Information Act 1982 \n \n \n \n\fCentrelink Data \nThe number of Indigenous Australians that are identified both on the Centrelink file sent to the AEC \nin July 2018 and the electoral Roll does not represent all Indigenous enrolments. It is limited to those \nIndigenous Australians who both receive a Centrelink benefit and who have self-identified as \nIndigenous to Centrelink. \n\nAfter considerable data cleansing and analysis the AEC identified 72,451 potentially unenrolled \nIndigenous Australians. This represents around 61 per cent of the 118,581 Indigenous Australians \nthe AEC estimate were unenrolled as at 30 June 2018 (see table 2 above).  \n\nThe enrolment stimulation event conducted in February/March 2019 resulted in the enrolment of \n2,646 Indigenous Australians, reducing the estimated number of unenrolled Indigenous Australians \nidentified in the Centrelink dataset to 69,143. Table 3 sets out the distribution of this cohort across \nelectoral divisions.  \n\nIt is important to note that the potential unenrolled under 65 Indigenous Australians as at the 2019 \nclose of rolls represents those people that are on the Centrelink file sent to the AEC in July 2018 and \nwho were included in the February 2019 enrolment stimulation event but had not enrolled as at the \n2019 close of rolls (18 April 2019).  \n\nAnalysis of the Centrelink potentially unenrolled Indigenous Australians 65 years and older identified \nsignificant matching error, due to the quality of data input and the nature of the residential status of \nthis cohort. Work will be undertaken on the 2018-19 dataset to better understand this phenomenon \nto facilitate better targeting of potentially unenrolled indigenous Australians in the future. \n\nTable 3 -
