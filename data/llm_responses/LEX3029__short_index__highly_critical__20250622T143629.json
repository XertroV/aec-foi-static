Far from robust, its core vote-counting function is a grotesque shambles: from knowingly deploying software that actively violates the Electoral Act and alters election outcomes for years, to confessing the catastrophic loss of thousands of votes and operating an inherently unauditable process demonstrably responsible for changing winners due to rounding errors and inconsistent rule application. The AEC's blatant disregard for transparency is further evidenced by its reliance on closed-source, unverified systems, active withholding of damning internal expert reports, and even the astonishing failure to provide a \"fully released\" critical response in the FOI itself, cementing the impression that Australia's electoral integrity is not merely compromised, but actively subverted by its designated custodians."

  "prompt": "With a highly critical view, provide a scathing, single-paragraph summary in markdown format of the following FOI request overview:\n\nSummary:\n\nThe provided FOI documents expose a disturbing pattern of systemic failure, opacity, and potential malfeasance within the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC)'s core function: ensuring accurate and legally compliant election counts. Far from a robust democratic process, the picture painted is one of fundamental incompetence and a blatant disregard for transparency.\n\n**Key failures and damning implications:**\n\n1.  **Legal Non-Compliance and Deliberate Deviation:**\n    *   The AEC's official counting software *actively violates the Electoral Act* on fundamental rules like tie-breaking, leading to candidates being \"excluded in the wrong order.\" This is not a minor bug, but a direct and proven failure to adhere to the supreme law governing elections.\n    *   For at least eight years (since 2013), the AEC has *knowingly failed to implement* \"bulk exclusion,\" a legislated rule, based on a \"mistaken belief.\" This non-compliance is explicitly stated to *alter election outcomes*, directly undermining the democratic will and the rule of law.\n    *   The Electoral Act itself is described as an \"awful means to document an algorithm\" and is riddled with critical ambiguities (e.g., when the count ends). This legislative chaos provides a convenient cover for the AEC's arbitrary interpretations and operational deviations.\n\n2.  **Unverified Processes and Contradictory Outcomes:**\n    *   The documents reveal *concrete examples* where the AEC's interpretation of ambiguous rules *directly changed who won a seat*. In the 2016 SA Senate special election, the AEC's discretionary application of rules resulted in a different winner than a plausible alternative interpretation.\n    *   The AEC's internal application of these ambiguous rules is *inconsistent over time* (e.g., 2016 vs. 2019), meaning the same votes processed at different elections could yield different results. This demonstrates a complete lack of a stable, auditable, and legally consistent counting methodology.\n    *   The system *inherently loses votes due to rounding*, a known flaw that demonstrably impacts close elections (e.g., 285 votes lost in Tasmania 2016, with a 143-vote margin). This is a built-in inaccuracy that directly affects outcomes.\n\n3.  **Catastrophic Data Integrity Failures:**\n    *   A shocking admission confirms the AEC *lost 1370 votes* in the 2013 WA Senate election. This represents a monumental failure in basic electoral management, rendering any subsequent \"recount\" or \"verification\" fundamentally compromised. The \"independent\" review cited by the AEC merely *assumed* how these lost votes would have behaved, highlighting a cover-up rather than a true resolution.\n    *   The *most crucial step* – converting paper ballots to digital preferences – is a \"combined human and automated process\" that is entirely opaque and *cannot be independently audited or verified*. The expert report explicitly states this leaves the AEC \"without a way of providing evidence of an accurate election outcome\" for this foundational input, rendering any subsequent digital count inherently untrustworthy.\n\n4.  **Active Obfuscation and Lack of Transparency:**\n    *   The AEC's core vote-counting software is *closed source*, actively preventing independent scrutiny and verification. This forces external experts to \"reverse-engineer\" its functionality and \"managed to obtain\" internal run logs, indicating a clear resistance to proactive disclosure.\n    *   The AEC *withheld internal \"Research team notes\"* on the damning expert report exposing its flaws, citing \"Deliberative matter.\" This is a classic tactic to shield internal discussions about systemic failures, avoid accountability, and prevent public understanding of how they processed critical findings.\n    *   The AEC initially categorized a critical expert report detailing \"Corrections to the Senate Counting algorithm\" as \"Release in part\" due to \"Relevance\" (S22), suggesting an attempt to downplay or hide the initial communication of fundamental errors before a later full release.\n    *   Most damningly, the FOI response *explicitly claims to \"Release in full\"* the AEC's official response to these critical findings (Document 7, dated 18/10/2021), yet the provided documents *do not contain it*. This is either gross incompetence in fulfilling a basic FOI request or a deliberate act of withholding the most crucial document outlining their official stance on these widespread failures, despite stating full release. This directly undermines the integrity of the FOI process itself.\n\n5.  **Reliance on Superficial and Potentially Partisan \"Verification\":**\n    *   The AEC internally referenced and appeared to rely on a Python script developed by a *Greens member* as an \"independent test\" that \"found no issue\" with AEC results. This is not a rigorous, neutral audit but a superficial, self-serving validation. The fact that the AEC uses this individual's software for \"scenarios\" while keeping its own code secret highlights a concerning reliance on externally developed tools without full transparency of its own.\n\nIn conclusion, these documents do not just point to isolated issues but illustrate a deeply flawed electoral counting system. The AEC's actions, or inactions, demonstrate systemic incompetence, a clear disregard for legal mandates, active obfuscation of critical information, and an inability to reliably guarantee the accuracy of election outcomes. The very bedrock of Australia's democratic process – the integrity of its vote counting – appears fundamentally compromised.\n\nProvide only the markdown formatted summary text. Do not include any conversational filler or preamble."
