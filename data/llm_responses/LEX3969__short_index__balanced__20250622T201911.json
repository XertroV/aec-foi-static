Released documents, including internal minutes and emails, reveal the AEC's collaboration with Universal McCann to inform the public and ensure voter participation. While TikTok was identified as a valuable channel to reach younger demographics (17-24/18-24), significant concerns were raised regarding its use, including its ban on government devices, brand safety issues, and an ongoing Department of Finance review. Despite an initial recommendation to remove TikTok due to high risks, it was ultimately retained in the media plans for budgeting purposes, with the rationale that it is \"very easy to pull out of plans later, harder to add back.\" Its inclusion remains conditional on ongoing consultation with the Defending Democracy Unit and Department of Finance, and explicit government approval. The AEC also prepared a cautious public statement, denying current TikTok trials or plans while confirming ongoing media channel mix development."

  "prompt": "Create a concise, single-paragraph summary in markdown format of the following FOI request summary:\n\nSummary:\n\n## Summary of FOI Request Documents: AEC Referendum Advertising Media Plans\n\nThis summary outlines the purpose of the Freedom of Information (FOI) request, the nature of the released documents, and their key content related to the Australian Electoral Commission's (AEC) referendum advertising campaign.\n\n### Main Purpose of the FOI Request\n\nThe FOI request sought information regarding the Australian Electoral Commission's (AEC) media strategy and channel mix for an upcoming referendum advertising campaign. A particular focus of the request, and the documents provided, is the proposed use of the social media platform TikTok for this campaign, including associated risks and internal discussions.\n\n### Documents from the FOI Request\n\nThe released documents include:\n*   **Access Decision Log:** A table outlining the document numbers, applied exemptions (e.g., s22 for irrelevant content, s47 for personal/business information), and the decision on access (full, partial, or refused).\n*   **Internal Minutes and Reports:** Official \"Minute referendum advertising campaign: media plans\" documents and comprehensive \"AEC REFERENDUM\" reports. These detail proposed media channel mixes, campaign objectives, risk assessments, and internal recommendations. Many sections are redacted due to exemptions.\n*   **Email Correspondence:** Internal communications discussing early ideas for paid media partnerships, preparations for addressing disinformation, and the formulation of a public response regarding the use of TikTok.\n\n### Main Content Related to the FOI Request\n\nThe documents reveal the AEC's strategic considerations for its referendum advertising campaign, with a significant portion dedicated to the debate surrounding TikTok's inclusion:\n\n*   **Referendum Campaign Goal:** The primary objective of the advertising campaign is to inform the public and ensure they can fulfil their right and responsibility to vote in the upcoming referendum. The campaign will be multi-channel.\n*   **Media Planning:** The AEC is collaborating with Universal McCann (UM) on media placement. The proposed media channel mix is being developed, with comparisons drawn to strategies used in the 2022 Federal Election.\n*   **Consideration and Concerns Regarding TikTok:**\n    *   **Recommendation for Inclusion:** TikTok was identified as a valuable channel to reach younger audiences (specifically 17-24 and 18-24 demographics) due to its high user engagement and significant user base in Australia (8.9 million monthly users). It was suggested that piloting TikTok for the referendum could provide incremental reach to this priority audience.\n    *   **Identified Risks:** Significant risks and concerns were highlighted regarding TikTok:\n        *   It had recently been banned on Australian government-owned devices.\n        *   There are ongoing \"brand safety concerns\" both domestically and internationally.\n        *   The Department of Finance is conducting a whole-of-government review on TikTok advertising.\n        *   It was noted that no other government department or agency had used TikTok for their campaigns.\n        *   Reputation management was deemed a crucial selection criterion for any potential paid media partnerships involving the platform.\n    *   **Internal Debate and Decision-Making:**\n        *   Initially, the AEC's Communications Section recommended removing TikTok from all campaign phases due to the high-risk profile, suggesting it only be considered as a potential paid media partner.\n        *   However, later internal minutes indicate that TikTok was *retained* in the media plans for budgeting purposes. The rationale was that it is \"very easy to pull out of plans later, harder to add back.\"\n        *   The AEC committed to ongoing consultation with its Defending Democracy Unit (DDU), UM, and the Department of Finance to ensure TikTok's continued appropriateness before formalising any media bookings. The DDU expressed a preference for TikTok to be an 'add in later if appropriate' rather than being included with the possibility of removal.\n        *   The use of TikTok remains explicitly \"subject to Government approval and current advice.\"\n        *   UM provided guidance on mitigating brand safety risks.\n        *   It was noted that TikTok would primarily be used for \"mainstream audiences\" as it lacks scale for \"in-language targeting.\"\n*   **Disinformation Management:** The documents acknowledge that social media platforms are significant conduits for disinformation regarding voting and political matters, emphasizing the need for strategic engagement on these platforms.\n*   **Public Communication:** A draft media response prepared for public inquiries stated that the AEC had not run a trial referendum campaign using TikTok, nor were there plans to do so, while also confirming that planning for the channel mix was ongoing. This reflects a cautious approach to public statements regarding the controversial platform.\n\nProvide only the markdown formatted summary text. Do not include any conversational filler or preamble."
