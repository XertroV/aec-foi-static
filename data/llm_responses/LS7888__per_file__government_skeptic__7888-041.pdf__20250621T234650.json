            "text": "This \"Estimates Brief\" serves as a prime example of bureaucratic spin, deliberately designed to present a positive, controlled narrative rather than transparently addressing core issues. While ostensibly providing \"current enrolment figures, trends,\" it conspicuously confirms the use of a \"different methodology\" for Indigenous enrolment, which conveniently resulted in a dramatically higher estimated rate (76.6% in 2018-19, up from 58% in 2014) without offering any explanation or justification for this significant shift. From a skeptic's viewpoint, this omission aligns perfectly with the FOI overview's assertion of \"questionable data manipulation\" and the leveraging of a \"new methodology\" to manage perception, rather than reflecting genuine improvements.\n\nThe document states the Indigenous enrolment rate \"remained steady\" at 76.6% for 2018-19, implicitly admitting that despite the AEC \"investing in partnerships and targeted activities,\" there was no further measurable improvement in that period. This highlights an apparent inefficiency, where significant resources are vaguely committed (no cost or staffing details are provided, reinforcing the \"deliberately withheld crucial planning, cost, and staffing details\" claim from the FOI overview) without yielding tangible, ongoing enrolment growth. The brief's vague assurance that the AEC \"is working to ensure the full electoral participation\" through unspecified \"partnerships and targeted activities\" reads as a generic bureaucratic statement, lacking the specific performance metrics or accountability measures one would expect if genuine outcomes were the primary focus. Overall, this document, typical of internal reporting for parliamentary estimates, prioritizes surface-level reassurance and the concealment of methodological intricacies and true program efficacy, rather than candidly exposing challenges or detailing substantive progress."

  "prompt": "From a government skeptic's viewpoint, summarize this specific document within the context of the FOI request. Look for evidence of bureaucracy, lack of accountability, or any hidden agendas. The overall FOI overview is: The Australian Electoral Commission's (AEC) response to FOI request LS7888 exposes a troubling lack of transparency, questionable data manipulation, and apparent inefficiency within its Indigenous Electoral Participation Program (IEPP). From a skeptic's viewpoint, the AEC deliberately withheld crucial planning, cost, and staffing details, raising immediate suspicions about public accountability and genuine community involvement. Its \"new methodology\" conveniently presented a dramatically improved Indigenous enrolment rate by leveraging Centrelink data, despite internal caveats about \"courageous assumptions\" and figures being \"indicative only,\" and a Deputy Commissioner's explicit warning against deliberate misrepresentation. This statistically dubious approach, coupled with demonstrably inefficient outreach—resulting in a meager 3.6% enrolment conversion from a major event—and documented internal data integrity issues, suggests a bureaucratic exercise primarily focused on managing perception and obscuring true costs rather than achieving substantive outcomes for Indigenous enrolment.\n\nDocument Text:\n\nESTIMATES BRIEF – HOT ISSUE \n\nSupplementary Budget Estimates, October 2019 \n\nCURRENT ENROLMENT FIGURES, TRENDS \n\nIssue \n\nFor the 2019 federal election, more Australians were enrolled than ever before— \nboth in terms of raw numbers and as a percentage of the eligible population. \n\nKey facts and figures \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n16,424,248 Australians were enrolled to vote in the 2019 federal election,\nrepresenting an enrolment rate of 97.0 per cent.\n\nThe youth enrolment rate (18-24 year olds) at the federal election was\n88.8 per cent. Like the general population, young people are enrolled at\nrecord levels.\n\n.\n\nThe Indigenous enrolment rate remained steady and for 2018-19 the\nnational estimated Indigenous enrolment rate is at 76.6 per cent.\n\nKey points \n\nThe Australian Electoral Commission works to ensure the full electoral\nparticipation of all eligible Australians. The electoral roll for the 2019\nfederal election was the largest and most complete ever.\n\nA record 16,424,248 Australians were determined as enrolled to vote in\nthe 2019 federal election, from of an estimated eligible population of\n16.9 million people. This represents an enrolment rate of 97.0 per cent, an\nincrease on the previous record rate for the 2016 federal election.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSB19-000044 \n\n.\n\n1 \n\nLS7888 Released Document No. 411919191919Released under the Freedom of Information Act 1982\fBackground \n\n2019 federal election \n\n A record 16,424,248 electors were enrolled from of an estimated eligible population of\n\n16.9 million people. This represents a national enrolment rate of 97.0 per cent.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImmediately following the roll close the AEC reported a preliminary enrolment rate of\n96.8 per cent. This, however, was subsequently revised to 97.0 per cent following the\napplication of more up-to-date eligible enrolment population estimates.\n\nThe enrolment rate exceeded the AEC’s target of 95 per cent in all states and territories\nexcept the Northern Territory, where it increased from 81.1 per cent at the 2016 election\nto 83.9 per cent.\n\nThe youth enrolment rate (18-24 year olds) was 88.8 per cent. Like the general\npopulation, young people are enrolled at record levels.\n\nTable: Summary of key enrolment metrics \n\nEnrolment metric \n\nFE2016 \n\nAMLPS \n\nFE2019 \n\nChange between \nFE2016 and FE2019 \n\nEnrolled electors \n\n15,676,659  16,011,891  16,424,248 \n\n 747,589\n\nEnrolment rate \n\nEstimated not \nenrolled \n\n95.0% \n\n95.7% \n\n97.0%   2.0 percentage points\n\n816,437 \n\n724,055 \n\n509,891 \n\n 306,546\n\nYouth enrolment rate \n\n86.7% \n\n88.6% \n\n88.8%   2.1 percentage points\n\nCurrent state of the roll \n\n As at 30 September 2019, the national enrolment rate was 96.8 per cent, which is\n\n0.2 percentage points lower than for the 2019 federal election.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is normal for the enrolment rate to decline following an election. The estimated number\nof people not enrolled has grown by around 37,000 since the election with the vast\nmajority of these being people who turned 18 following the election.\n\nIn the lead up to the 2019 election, the AEC conducted an enrolment stimulation exercise,\ntargeting 410,000 people nationally who were not enrolled.\n\nYouth enrolment \n\n Younger electors tend to enrol in proximity to an electoral event.\n\n\n\nThe youth enrolment rate (18-24 year olds) as at 30 September 2019 was 86.5 per cent\nwith 1,643,338 enrolled youth, a reduction of 2.3 percentage points since the federal\nelection.\n\n While the AEC works to maintain the youth enrolment rate as high as possible, it is not\n\nunusual for the youth enrolment rate to improve at the time of a federal election and then\ndecline between elections.\n\nSB19-000044 \n\n2 \n\nLS7888 Released Document No. 41Released under the Freedom of Information Act 1982\fIndigenous enrolment \n\n\n\nThe AEC commenced publication of Indigenous enrolment rate estimates by state and\nterritory as at 30 June 2018.\n\n A previous national Indigenous enrolment estimate of 58 per cent was calculated in 2014\n\nusing a different methodology.\n\n\n\nThe national Indigenous enrolment rate estimate remains steady and as at 30 June 2019\nthe rate was 76.6 per cent compared with 76.4 per cent in 2018.\n\n Any gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous enrolment rates is concerning.\n\n\n\nThe AEC is working to ensure the full electoral participation of all eligible Australians\nand is investing in partnerships and targeted activities that extend its reach into remote\ncommunities. Remote Area Mobile Polling remains an important component of election\nservice delivery.\n\nNorthern Territory enrolment \n\n\n\n\n\nEnrolment in the Northern Territory has shown consistent improvement.\n\nThe enrolment rate in the Northern Territory increased by 9.8 percentage points between\n30 June 2010 and 30 June 2019 while the national enrolment rate increased by\n7.4 percentage points.\n\nNorthern \nTerritory \n\nEnrolment \n\nEstimated \nEligible \nPopulation \n\nEnrolment \nrate \n\nEstimated not \nenrolled \n\n30/06/2010 \n30/06/2011 \n30/06/2012 \n30/06/2013 \n30/06/2014 \n30/06/2015 \n30/06/2016 \n30/06/2017 \n30/06/2018 \n30/06/2019 \n\n118,401 \n121,919 \n122,715 \n126,934 \n130,857 \n129,133 \n133,553 \n137,773 \n138,581 \n140,064 \n\n158,894 \n155,559 \n155,537 \n156,552 \n161,868 \n162,780 \n164,012 \n165,876 \n165,118 \n166,136 \n\n74.5% \n78.4% \n78.9% \n81.1% \n80.8% \n79.3% \n81.4% \n83.1% \n83.9% \n84.3% \n\n40,493 \n33,640 \n32,822 \n29,618 \n31,011 \n33,647 \n30,459 \n28,103 \n26,537 \n26,072 \n\nPublic reporting \n\n A range of enrolment statistics are published regularly on the AEC website.\n\nDate: \nCleared by (FAC): \nTelephone: \nBranch: \nContact officer: \nTelephone: \nConsultation: \nPDR number: \n\n22 October 2019 \nTim Courtney for Andrew Gately \n(02) 6271 4410\nRoll Management and Community Engagement\nRobyn Legg\n(02) 6271 4786\nNil\nSB19-000044\n\nSB19-000044 \n\n3 \n\nLS7888 Released Document No. 41Released under the Freedom of Information Act 1982\fREDACTION CODES \n\nPersonal Information (name) redacted. \n\nPersonal Information (date of birth) redacted. \n\nPersonal Information (photograph) redacted \n\nPersonal Information (facsimile of signature) redacted. \n\nPersonal Information (facsimile of manuscript initialling) redacted. \n\nPersonal Information (Individual’s address) redacted. \n\nPersonal Information (individual’s telephone number) redacted. \n\nPersonal Information (individual’s opinion) redacted. \n\nPersonal Information (opinion about individual) redacted. \n\nPersonal Information (employment history) redacted. \n\nPersonal Information (qualifications) redacted. \n\nPersonal Information (health) redacted. \n\nPersonal Information (identifying individual) redacted. \n\nBusiness information (Bank Account details) redacted. \n\nBusiness information (Billing Account details) redacted. \n\nBusiness information (internal operations) redacted. \n\nLegal Professional Communication redacted. \n\nDeliberative material redacted. \n\nIrrelevant material redacted. \n\nElectoral Roll material redacted. \n\nTests, examinations or audits material redacted. \n\nManagement or assessment of personnel material redacted. \n\nProper and efficient conduct of the operations of AEC material redacted. \n\nLawful methods or procedures for preventing, detecting, investigating, or \ndealing with matters arising out of, breaches or evasions of the law. \n\nTrade Secrets. \n\nCommercial valuable information. \n\nFinancial interests of the Commonwealth. \n\nProperty interests of the Commonwealth. \n\n1 \n\n2 \n\n3 \n\n4 \n\n5 \n\n6 \n\n7 \n\n8 \n\n9 \n\n10 \n\n11 \n\n12 \n\n13 \n\n14 \n\n15 \n\n16 \n\n17 \n\n18 \n\n19 \n\n20 \n\n21 \n\n22 \n\n23 \n\n24 \n\n25 \n\n26 \n\n27 \n\n28 \n\n\f\n\nProvide only the markdown formatted summary text.
