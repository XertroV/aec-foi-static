The core of the exchange is an urgent \"request to Google\" from the AEC regarding an unspecified matter, likely related to electoral content or compliance. Google Australia acknowledges receipt of this request, confirms it was sent to their legal team for urgent review, and states that a response has been provided to the EIAT. The email chain also includes an automated acknowledgment from the YouTube Legal Support Team for the original \"request to Google,\" providing a reference number.\n\n### Relevance to FOI Request LEX3037\nThis document is highly relevant to FOI request LEX3037, which seeks information on the AEC's correspondence with major tech companies (including Google) regarding electoral law compliance and the 2022 federal election. Specifically, it demonstrates:\n*   **Direct Communication Channels:** It confirms the existence and active use of direct communication channels between the AEC's EIAT and Google/YouTube.\n*   **Proactive Engagement:** The AEC's \"request to Google\" highlights its proactive engagement with platforms to address specific concerns leading up to the election.\n*   **Content Referrals/Urgent Review:** The internal referral of the AEC's request to Google's legal team for \"urgent review\" and the subsequent confirmation of a response indicate the process for handling potentially non-compliant or concerning electoral content.\n*   **Safeguarding Election Integrity:** The timing of the exchange (the day before the election) underscores the real-time, high-priority nature of these interactions in safeguarding election integrity by addressing issues promptly."
