It reports on the AEC's appearance before the Finance and Public Administration Committee for Senate Estimates.\n\n### Relevance to FOI Request:\n\nThe document is highly relevant as it explicitly states that \"Authorisations – current investigations (Andrew Laming MP)\" was a topic of questioning by Senator Tim Ayres (ALP) during the Senate Estimates hearing. This confirms that the AEC's investigation into Andrew Laming MP's compliance with federal electoral authorisation laws, which is the subject of the FOI request, was an active and publicly discussed matter at a high-level parliamentary proceeding."

Do not include any conversational filler or preamble.To aid you, the overview of the FOI request is: [REQUEST OVERVIEW START] The FOI request disclosed documents detailing the Australian Electoral Commission's (AEC) investigation into Andrew Laming MP's Facebook pages for compliance with federal electoral authorisation laws. This inquiry was triggered by public complaints and media reports, notably from *The Guardian*, alleging Laming used numerous pages (e.g., \"Redland Bay Bulletin,\" \"Redlands Institute\") disguised as community or news groups to promote political content and attack opponents without mandatory disclosures. The AEC confirmed an active investigation, noting 2018 Electoral Act amendments broadened social media authorisation, and issued formal notices to Laming for detailed information and to third parties (like Facebook) for data, with Facebook confirming its cooperation. Findings revealed some pages were removed or updated with authorisation, while others remained active and unauthorised.\n [REQUEST OVERVIEW END] \n\n--- MAIN DOCUMENT TEXT START ---\n\n\n\n--- Page 1 ---\n\nAEC.0002.0001.6803\n\nFrom:                                 MPS MailboxSent:                                  Fri, 28 May 2021 09:29:36 +1000To:                                      Adam Coenraads;Andrew Johnson;Belinda Bennett;Bernadette O'Meara;Bronwen Williamson;Cameron Stokes;David Molnar;FAD;Grace Bryant;Guy Lewis;Internalcomms;International Mailbox;Jacquie Travia;Joanne Reid;Julie Igglesden;Julie McDougall;Karen Wilson;Kaye Bartlett;Kirstie Pollock;Legal Services Mailbox;Matthew Haigh;media;Melinda Vernon;MPS Mailbox;Natasha Scandrett;Nicole Taylor;Nye Coffey;Parliamentary Engagement and Party Registration;Rachel Allen;Rachel Dieckmann;Robert Todkill;Roger Wills;Sally Roberts;Sean Ferrari;SES Confidential;Virginia LindenmayerSubject:                             Parliamentary Review - Friday 28 May 2021 [SEC=OFFICIAL] MINISTERIAL AND PARLIAMENTARY SERVICESParliamentary Review - Friday 28 May 2021SUMMARYThe AEC appeared before the Finance and Public Administration Committee for Estimates last night.

Follow on ParlWatch. Yesterday, Shadow Attorney-General Mark Dreyfus (Isaacs, Vic, ALP) spoke on political donations, referencing donations by Canstruct executives to the Liberal National Party. The final report of JSCEM’s review of the FAD Reform Act was also presented. The report makes no recommendations, observing that the legislation is working effectively. JSCEM Member James Stevens (Sturt SA, LP) said: “It is clear from the evidence provided to this inquiry that, after an initial transition period, the act in its current form is working appropriately and not hindering the current activities of charitable based organisations. It is very positive that many members of the sector report that their organisations have gained familiarity with the definitions and find them workable. The committee notes there are a variety of conflicting views about possible amendments, but this reflects diverse interest from observers of the political system and is not suggestive of fundamental structural problems.” – StevensHouse of RepresentativesChamber documents:        Votes and Proceedings – Thursday 27 May 2021        Hansard – Thursday 27 May 2021SenateEstimates:Consolidated programAEC appearance: Webcast (from 16:03) | Hansard (Not yet published)JSCEMCurrent inquiries:        Future conduct of elections operating during times of emergency situations Completed inquiries:        Review of the FAD Reform Act – Final report  Jake Farquharson and Bronwen WilliamsonParliamentary Engagement and Party Registration Section | Disclosure, Assurance and Engagement BranchAustralian Electoral CommissionT: (02) 6271 4582 X: 21410 (Jake, A/g Parliamentary Advisor)T: (02) 6271 4705 X: 25007 (Bronwen, A/g Parliamentary Support)\n\n\n--- Page 3 ---\n\nAEC.0002.0001.6805\n\n"
