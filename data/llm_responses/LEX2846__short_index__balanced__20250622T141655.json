The AEC also adapted its **postal voting policy** for COVID-positive individuals and noted reduced mobile polling. Revealed were significant **logistical and financial challenges**, including projected cost increases and staffing difficulties, prompting the AEC to seek greater legislative flexibility for emergency election management.

  "prompt": "Create a concise, single-paragraph summary in markdown format of the following FOI request summary:\n\nSummary:\n\nThe FOI request (No. LEX2846) sought comprehensive documentation related to the Australian Electoral Commission's (AEC) response to the COVID-19 pandemic concerning electoral processes. Specifically, it requested:\n*   Drafts of legislation, explanatory material, policy papers, and briefs related to the development of the COVID Enfranchisement Bill and Regulations.\n*   Advice provided to AEC social media and call-centre staff on assisting COVID-positive voters.\n*   Policy documents concerning the use of postal voting for COVID-positive voters.\n*   A list of files from the AEC's record management systems containing \"COVID\", \"COVID-19\", \"coronavirus\", or \"pandemic\".\n\nThe released documents include:\n*   An Australian Electoral Commission submission to the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters (JSCEM) from November 2020.\n*   Draft Commonwealth Electoral (COVID Enfranchisement) Regulations 2022.\n*   A \"Customer Journey\" draft (version 7) outlining a proposed voting experience for COVID-isolating customers, dated March 2022.\n*   Various internal documents providing talking points, key messages, and contact centre scripts for AEC staff regarding secure telephone voting for COVID-19 affected voters, dated between March and May 2022.\n*   The AEC's Postal Voting policy, dated February 2022.\n*   A list of relevant files from the AEC's record management system.\n\n### Main Content from FOI Request Documents:\n\n**1. COVID Enfranchisement Legislation & Telephone Voting:**\n*   The **Commonwealth Electoral (COVID Enfranchisement) Regulations 2022** were drafted to establish a secure telephone voting method for \"coronavirus affected individuals.\" This measure was proposed for federal elections, allowing voters who test positive for COVID-19 and are directed to self-isolate/quarantine to cast their vote by phone if they cannot attend a polling place.\n*   **Eligibility** requires an individual to be registered, on an approved electoral roll, not have already voted, and to have become COVID-affected within a specific narrow timeframe (e.g., from 6:01 pm four days before polling day) under a public health order preventing their attendance at a polling place.\n*   The **Customer Journey draft** details a two-step process: **Registration**, where voters register online or by phone providing personal details and evidence of their positive test (e.g., reference/serial number from a health authority) to receive a unique registration number and PIN; and **Voting**, where they call a dedicated line, quote their registration number and PIN (for anonymity), and verbally instruct an operator on how to mark their ballot.\n*   The **Staff Talking Points** and **Contact Centre Scripts** emphasize that this is an \"emergency measure only\" and anticipate \"long wait times.\" They provide guidance on proof of COVID-19 status, registration and voting hours, and strongly encourage voters to view ballot paper images online beforehand to expedite calls.\n\n**2. Postal Voting for COVID-Positive Voters:**\n*   The **Postal Voting policy (February 2022)** outlines the general framework for postal votes, which can be utilized by individuals unable to attend a polling place due to serious illness or infirmity, a category that can include COVID-positive voters.\n*   A note within the policy confirms that \"mobile polling facilities may not be provided\" to nursing homes and hospitals due to the COVID-19 pandemic, suggesting increased reliance on postal voting for these vulnerable groups.\n*   **Staff Talking Points** advised COVID-positive individuals who tested positive earlier than the telephone voting eligibility cut-off to apply for a postal vote, also addressing concerns like securing a witness while isolating.\n\n**3. General Election Administration & COVID Impact:**\n*   The **JSCEM Submission (November 2020)** highlights the AEC's need for greater legislative flexibility (amendments to the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918) to manage elections during emergencies. This includes granting the Electoral Commissioner powers to determine electoral processes and to adjourn or suspend polling.\n*   The submission outlines significant **logistical and financial impacts** of conducting elections during the pandemic, drawing lessons from the Eden-Monaro by-election (2020). These include:\n    *   Nearly doubling the cost of the by-election due to COVID-19 prevention measures.\n    *   Estimating a 30% increase in polling staff and over $30 million in additional costs for a federal election due to hygiene, social distancing, and PPE.\n    *   Challenges with staffing availability, supply chains for materials (e.g., PPE), and managing voter turnout.\n    *   Changes in voting trends, with a significant increase in postal and pre-poll votes.\n*   The **Staff Talking Points** and **Contact Centre Scripts** detail the **COVID-Safe measures** implemented at in-person polling places, such as controlling venue capacity, providing hand sanitiser, regular cleaning of surfaces, managing queues, appointing hygiene officers, and encouraging voters to bring their own pencils.\n*   For transparency and integrity, all AEC staff involved in the telephone voting service are required to be Australian Public Service employees and sign political neutrality declarations. Scrutineers are permitted to observe the process (with voter consent for call listening), and stringent ballot paper handling and reconciliation procedures are maintained. The AEC also provides an email for complaints related to the phone voting service.\n*   The **List of Files** indicates the broad scope of internal AEC documentation and planning in response to the pandemic, covering operational, policy, and safety aspects.\n\nProvide only the markdown formatted summary text. Do not include any conversational filler or preamble."
