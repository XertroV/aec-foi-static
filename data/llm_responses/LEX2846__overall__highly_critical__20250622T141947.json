            "text": "The following summary adopts a highly critical stance, meticulously dissecting the provided FOI documents to expose systemic failures, incompetence, and potential malice in the government's handling of electoral processes during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n**I. Systemic Failure & Gross Incompetence in Emergency Preparedness (AEC Submission to JSCEM, November 2020):**\n\n*   **Profound Lack of Foresight:** Despite acknowledging federal elections as Australia's \"biggest peacetime logistical event,\" the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) was catastrophically unprepared for a foreseeable pandemic. Their November 2020 submission, almost a year into the global crisis, is a desperate plea for legislative changes that should have been proactively sought years prior, or at minimum, immediately after the pandemic's onset.\n*   **Blame Shifting and Evasion of Responsibility:** The AEC consistently externalizes blame, citing a \"complex environment\" and reliance on \"ministers and senior officials across governments.\" This abdication of leadership demonstrates a failure to secure autonomy or assert the criticality of electoral functions within government.\n*   **Pre-existing Failures Amplified:** The document admits \"existing challenges\" like difficulty recruiting temporary staff, supply chain vulnerabilities, limited premises, and inadequate access for disabled, overseas, regional, homeless, and Indigenous voters were merely \"exacerbated\" by COVID-19. This is a damning confession that fundamental electoral integrity and accessibility were compromised *before* the pandemic, with COVID-19 simply revealing the depth of these long-standing systemic inequities.\n*   **Legislative Inflexibility & Delayed Action:** The AEC's belated request for powers to \"extend reasons electors can postal or pre-poll vote,\" \"conduct an election solely by postal vote,\" or \"expand categories of electors who may utilise the electronic (telephone) voting method\" is a stark admission of its own reactive, rather than proactive, stance. The existing powers (Sections 240A, 241, 242) for suspending polling were deemed insufficient, highlighting a stunning lack of comprehensive legislative review or foresight in preparing for emergencies beyond simple \"anthrax scares.\" Their inability to leverage broader existing powers (Section 286) due to internal constraints further underscores their organizational paralysis.\n\n**II. Disenfranchisement, Financial Mismanagement, and Operational Chaos (Eden-Monaro By-election Analysis, AEC Submission):**\n\n*   **Disenfranchisement of Vulnerable Voters:** The \"decision not to conduct mobile polling for the event,\" forcing aged care facilities and hospitals onto postal voting, is a direct act of disenfranchisement. The abysmal \"9 per cent of postal votes sent to overseas electors were admitted to the count\" (compared to 33% previously) is irrefutable evidence of a catastrophic failure to ensure access for a specific, often geographically isolated, demographic.\n*   **Explosive Cost Overruns:** The by-election's cost \"almost doubling to $3.954 million\" due to \"additional polling locations... additional staff... PPE and other hygiene materials\" exposes gross financial mismanagement stemming from reactive, inefficient planning. The pre-emptive warning that the \"likely impact on the federal election budget is clear\" and that \"specialised materials... raise the cost... in excess of $30 million\" forebodes continued taxpayer waste.\n*   **Spin Over Substance:** The claim that the AEC \"aimed to reduce voter anxiety... by showing the AEC was prepared\" is a transparent attempt at public relations spin to mask fundamental unpreparedness. \"Awareness of the environmental context was key to the campaign’s success\" prioritizes perception over actual operational effectiveness.\n*   **Rushed & Inadequate Training:** The need to \"adapt quickly to develop and deliver appropriate and relevant training\" in \"only three weeks\" highlights a last-minute scramble, suggesting the training was likely superficial and insufficient, compromising the integrity of the process.\n*   **Inefficient Operations & Unacceptable Wait Times:** Data revealing the \"ordinary vote issuing process took 16.5 seconds (or 46 per cent) longer\" points to severe inefficiency. The queue modelling exposing potential \"maximum queue\" times of \"55.42 minutes\" reveals an electoral system utterly incapable of maintaining acceptable service levels without exorbitant increases in staffing and resources, which itself incurs \"an estimated 30 per cent increase in polling staff required, costing approximately an additional $13 million.\"\n*   **Fundamental Logistical Failures:** Admissions of \"procurement lead times,\" \"supply chain risks,\" and \"significant challenges for bulk storage availability\" reveal a complete lack of basic logistical foresight and planning for essential election materials.\n\n**III. Bureaucratic Hurdles & Undermined Secrecy in Telephone Voting (Customer Journey, Regulations, Call Centre Scripts):**\n\n*   **Delayed, Restrictive, & Arbitrary Access:** The \"DRAFT v7\" of the \"Customer Journey\" in March 2022, just months before the election, indicates a protracted and incompetent development process. The \"Commonwealth Electoral (COVID Enfranchisement) Regulations 2022,\" undated in the final version but appearing in 2022, were clearly a last-minute legislative scramble.\n    *   The narrow eligibility window for telephone voting – \"after 6pm Tuesday 17 May\" then abruptly changed to \"after 6pm Friday 13 May\" days before the election – created deliberate confusion and limited access for genuinely sick voters.\n    *   The requirement for sick voters to provide highly specific proof (\"test centre location, date, time, and ref # from your health authority\" or \"RAT brand and serial number\") placed an unreasonable and discriminatory burden on individuals already suffering from illness.\n    *   The Ministerial power to \"specify matters\" for eligibility introduces political influence into what should be an independent electoral process.\n*   **Legalized Disenfranchisement & Self-Protection:** Regulation 7(1) explicitly states that the AEC is only required to provide telephone voting \"to the extent feasible,\" and Crucially, 7(4) declares \"Any failure to provide a telephone voting method... does not invalidate the result of a general election.\" This is a cynical legal shield designed to insulate the government and AEC from accountability for systemic failures and voter disenfranchisement.\n*   **Erosion of Secret Ballot & Voter Agency:** The telephone voting process, where a \"Service Officer records the voter’s preference on the ballot papers,\" fundamentally compromises the secret ballot and removes direct voter agency. The reliance on a third-party transcriber introduces potential for error, bias, or even malicious manipulation, with only a weak \"read back\" safeguard. The declaration that \"it is irrelevant that the voter did not complete the ballot paper personally\" (Reg. 24(2)(c)) legalizes this profound breach of democratic principle.\n*   **Misleading Public Statements:** The \"Key Messaging\" and \"Call Centre Scripts\" falsely claim, \"The AEC voting assistant will not know the voter’s name and address\" and \"Phone operators are not given your name, address, or phone number. They are only given registration numbers, to protect your privacy.\" This directly contradicts Regulation 23(1)(a), which requires the Divisional Returning Officer to \"find the name of the voter that corresponds to the registration number on the envelope\" for scrutiny. This deliberate obfuscation of the process demonstrates a willingness to mislead the public about the true extent of anonymity.\n*   **Inadequate Capacity & Blame-Shifting for Delays:** The call centre scripts repeatedly justify \"lengthy wait times\" by stating \"it’s busy\" and \"This is an emergency service, and it’s busy.\" This is an admission of woefully inadequate resourcing for a compulsory voting system. The passive aggressive suggestion that voters \"should be prepared for potentially long wait times\" places the burden of inconvenience and potential disenfranchisement directly onto the sick citizen.\n*   **Punishing the Ill & Helpers:** The regulations create an \"offence for false or misleading declaration\" (Reg. 26), effectively criminalizing honest mistakes by sick individuals. Furthermore, the penalty for an individual who \"assists the voter\" without the voter explicitly stating they \"require another individual’s assistance\" (Reg. 15(2)) actively deters much-needed support for vulnerable voters. The \"strict liability\" offense for voting more than once (Reg. 27(3)) further criminalizes potentially confused or disoriented sick individuals.\n*   **Flawed Scrutiny and Lack of Transparency:** Regulations limiting scrutineers to the \"number of call centre operators\" (Reg. 20(2)) and criminalizing communication not \"reasonably necessary\" (Reg. 20(6)) severely curtail effective oversight. The contradictory statement that \"An audio recording must not be made... of a vote\" (Reg. 16(8)) undermines any claim of transparency or the ability for scrutineers to verify vote accuracy.\n*   **Abrupt Service Closures & Lack of Cohesion:** The internal memos show critical changes to registration eligibility and online portal closures happening just days before the election, indicative of a chaotic and uncoordinated rollout that actively hindered voter access.\n\nIn conclusion, these documents paint a damning picture of a government and its electoral body exhibiting systemic unpreparedness, reactive and incompetent decision-making, and a callous disregard for voter accessibility, particularly for vulnerable populations during a public health crisis. The measures implemented were often too late, too limited, unnecessarily burdensome, and characterized by a disturbing lack of transparency and a focus on legal self-preservation over democratic integrity. The financial implications highlight significant waste due to these fundamental failures in foresight and execution."

There are currently over 16 million Australians \nenrolled to vote, and the federal election dates are not known in advance. Once the writs are \nissued, the AEC mobilises to identify suitable polling staff, venues, and all supporting \nlogistical arrangements to administer the event.  \n\nEmergency situations are inherently difficult to predict and are typically associated with high \nlevels of uncertainty about either their cause or the scope and severity of their impacts.  An \nemergency situation has the potential to affect more than one jurisdiction, impact the \ncommunity, and create pressure for resources when there is competing demand.  \n\nThe Australian federal electoral system may be vulnerable to emergency situations in \ncircumstances where key components of the election are disrupted, including voting, election \nadministration and campaigning. The timing and location of an emergency situation will \ninfluence the required adjustments to administration and the mitigation strategies which are \nused.  \n\nThere are a number of key limitations in the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 (Electoral \nAct) that could constrain the AEC’s ability to respond to circumstances requiring suspension \nor disruption to components of election delivery, including at polling places.  \n\nThis submission highlights requirements for Parliament’s consideration that would assist the \nAEC in continuing to deliver high integrity federal elections through various emergency \nscenarios at the national, state, or regional level.  \n\nTo this end, the AEC considers the following amendments to legislation are advisable in \norder to provide the AEC with greater flexibility to respond to emergency situations: \n\n  Enabling the Electoral Commissioner to determine how certain electoral processes \nand activities may be undertaken, where these processes or activities are impacted \nby an emergency situation \n\n  Providing the Electoral Commissioner with the authority to make a decision to \n\nadjourn or suspend polling, or provide for the temporary suspension or adjournment \nof other events. \n\nPage 2\n\n\n--- Page 4 ---\n\nAdministering elections in \nemergency situations  \n\nBuilding confidence and trust in elections is as complex as it has ever been. The AEC is \ncommitted to ensuring Australia’s elections are conducted in a manner that inspires and \nsustains confidence of the public, and election stakeholders.  \n\nAn enduring challenge in the electoral environment during ordinary times is maintaining a \nmutual understanding amongst electoral stakeholders of the shared responsibilities and \naccountabilities in a number of areas, including maintaining voters’ trust in elections and \nensuring proactive actions are being taken to meet reasonable expectations around flexibility \nand responsiveness while providing for electoral integrity. \n\nElection planning and delivery in an emergency situation involves new stakeholders with \ntheir own remits and additional complexities. A more flexible legislative framework would \nprovide the AEC with greater flexibility to respond to emergencies and their impact on the \npublic and election stakeholders. \n\nThe complex environment  \n\nExternal guidance \n\nMost emergency situations will involve a declaration under Commonwealth, state or territory \nlaw. Those charged with managing an emergency situation and its consequences have \npressing priorities related to their respective remits around preservation and protection of \nlife, health, property and essential services. \n\nDuring any emergency situation, the AEC is only one stakeholder in a complex environment. \nManagement of an election during an emergency situation requires engagement with \nministers and senior officials across governments as well as advisory bodies. The specific \nstakeholders and their respective roles and responsibilities are dependent on the nature and \nseverity of the emergency situation, and can evolve as the situation changes.  \n\nA challenge with delivering a federal electoral event in a state or territory with a declared \nemergency will be conducting the event consistently with state or territory emergency \nrequirements. While the constitutional position is that a state or territory law should not \nprevent a Commonwealth agency or a person from carrying out their responsibilities under \nCommonwealth law, it will nevertheless be important to work with local authorities to ensure \nelectoral events are conducted consistently with local emergency requirements so that \nelectors, staff and others in an election are not put at risk.  \n\nA critical feature of the successful delivery of the Eden-Monaro by-election in the COVID-19 \nenvironment was the significant investment of time required, and the immense value \nobtained, from engaging with government departments across jurisdictions before and \n\nPage 3\n\n\n--- Page 5 ---\n\nduring the by-election. In delivering the by-election the AEC liaised closely with the \nCommonwealth Chief Medical Officer and the NSW Department of Health, emergency \nservices, the Electoral Integrity Assurance Taskforce and political participants. A similar \nmodel of consultation is in train for the Groom by-election.  \n\nThe AEC’s emergency situation response requires a streamlined approach to access key \nstakeholders, such as police, fire and emergency services, Chief Medical Officers, Defence \nand central security agencies. \n\nKey logistical challenges \n\nEmergencies can pose major logistical difficulties that could force significant compromises, \ndelays, or even render an election partially or fully undeliverable.  \n\nStaffing: The delivery of elections is reliant on huge temporary workforces who in an \nemergency situation may be less available. At a federal election the AEC relies on a \ntemporary workforce of approximately 90,000 people. Recruitment of temporary workers is \nincreasingly challenging in normal circumstances and an emergency situation could \nsuddenly pose significant recruitment and absenteeism challenges that could threaten the \ndelivery of the election. This is amplified in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic where \nadditional staff will be required to perform hygiene and sanitisation duties, manage queues \nand maintain voting service levels. \n\nMaterials and logistics: Supply chains are also likely to be affected depending on the scale \nof the emergency. The rapid outbreak of COVID-19 resulted in global shortages of personal \nprotective equipment (PPE) and lockdowns affected the transportation industry resulting in \nthe slower delivery of food and other supplies. In these circumstances, the supply of \nessential items for an election could become difficult or unattainable.   \n\nTurnout: Limitations on the movement and concentration of electors together with the risks \nof casualties during an emergency situation (for example, a natural disaster) can impact \nvoter turnout at an election and the legitimacy of the result. \n\nPremises: An election relies on the availability, at short notice, of thousands of premises to \nconduct voting and for counting centres. An emergency situation may reduce the availability \nor suitability of premises or reduce the willingness of venue owners to hire to the AEC.   \n\nService suppliers: The AEC partners with external service providers to facilitate aspects of \nthe election. Any impact to these major suppliers would have significant flow-on effects to \nthe running of an election event – for example in the preparation and dispatch of postal \nvotes, scanning and data capture of Senate ballot papers, printing of ballot papers, \npreparation of paper and electronic certified lists, etcetera. \n\nExacerbated existing challenges: Conducting an electoral event during an emergency \nsituation will exacerbate existing election delivery challenges including: \n\n  access to electoral services by electors: \n\no  with disability \no \no \n\nliving or travelling overseas \nlocated in regional and remote areas \n\nPage 4\n\n\n--- Page 6 ---\n\no  experiencing homelessness \n\n \n\n \n\nthe impacts of increasing number of electors voting early \n\nreliability and timeliness of postal services \n\n  provision of services to electors in Indigenous communities. \n\nArrangements for a federal election commence immediately following the previous one, with \napproach and policy decisions required early in order to implement required contracts, \nmaterials and plans in advance of the earliest possible election date. Changes to an election \ndelivery model will be shaped by election delivery options at that time.  \n\nBusiness Continuity \nThe AEC already has planned contingencies in place that position it to respond to significant \nbusiness disruption during the election period as part of its business continuity planning \narrangements. \n\nProposals that allow for greater flexibility in the way in which the AEC might respond to \nemergency situations will strengthen the AEC’s ability to effectively respond to and mitigate \nbusiness disruptions caused by such emergencies. \n\nPage 5\n\n\n--- Page 7 ---\n\nProposed areas of legislation for \nconsideration of amendment   \n\nThe prescriptive nature of the Electoral Act provides limited flexibility for how an election can \nbe conducted. For example, the Electoral Act provides few exceptions to the requirement for \nphysical attendance when voting, and those exceptions (for example, postal or telephone \nvoting) may not be available to all or scalable in an emergency situation.  \n\nTemporary modification \n\nTo provide greater flexibility in the event of an emergency situation, the Electoral Act could \nbe modified, for example, to: \n\n  extend the reasons electors can postal or pre-poll vote \n\n  conduct an election solely by postal vote (in some or all geographic areas) \n\n  streamline application and/or declaration requirements for postal voting and pre-poll \n\nvoting \n\n  expand categories of electors who may utilise the electronic (telephone) voting \n\nmethod \n\n  extend operating or polling hours, and/or \n\n  conduct scrutiny more safely.  \n\nAny modifications to the Electoral Act would only be possible for federal electoral events \nconducted in a state or territory or a geographic area of Australia where there is a declared \nemergency.    \n\nGiven the timeframes prescribed in the Electoral Act for conducting federal electoral events \n(from as little as 33 days), it is recommend that the authority to make emergency \nmodifications:  \n\n  may be exercised when there is a local or national emergency situation declared (or \n\nother public direction or determination made by a Minister in relation to an \nemergency’s effects on an election) under Commonwealth, state or territory law  \n\n \n\n \n\nis limited to the extent necessary to conduct an electoral event in the circumstances \n\nis exercised by the Electoral Commissioner and cannot be delegated to others \n\n  must be exercised by prescribing the modification in an instrument that will be tabled \n\nin Parliament \n\n \n\nis time limited, for example available only for the necessary time to respond to the \nemergency situation and its impact, or conduct the electoral event. \n\nTo exercise the authority to make emergency modifications the Electoral Commissioner \nwould have regard to the following matters: \n\n \n\nthe election is conducted in a manner that inspires trust and sustains public \nconfidence \n\nPage 6\n\n\n--- Page 8 ---\n\n \n\n \n\nthe need to ensure the safety of voters and electoral officials \n\nthe election process and release of results occur in a timely manner.  \n\nPractically, the exercise of any authority will be shaped by the time and operational \nenvironment of the given situation, and election delivery options available at that time. \n\nThe exercise of this authority would be subject to Parliamentary scrutiny in the same manner \nas the conduct of federal elections is reviewed in detail by the Joint Standing Committee on \nElectoral Maters. \n\nThe temporary nature of the modification means the electoral system remains unchanged \nonce the emergency situation has passed. \n\nAdjournment and temporary suspension \n\nSections 240A, 241 and 242 of the Electoral Act provide for the temporary suspension of \npolling and adjournment of polling (to another day) in certain circumstances. These sections \ndo not provide for flexibility in who may make a decision to adjourn or suspend polling, or \nprovide for the temporary suspension or adjournment of other election requirements, for \nexample where an emergency may affect close of rolls, nominations, early voting or scrutiny.  \n\nThe AEC recommends that Parliament consider broadening the powers in sections 240A, \n241 and 242 as follows: \n\n  The power to adjourn polling is given to the Electoral Commissioner rather than \npresiding officer, with the Electoral Commissioner having power to delegate this \nresponsibility to other officers as he or she considers appropriate. \n\n  The power to suspend polling be retained for presiding officers, and explicitly \n\nextended to officers in charge of pre-poll voting centres. \n\n  Broaden these powers or establish a new power for the Electoral Commissioner to \n\nsuspend or adjourn other electoral processes during the election period, for example \nwhere an emergency may affect the process such as close of rolls, nominations, \nearly voting or scrutiny. \n\nExisting provisions  \nThe following are areas where the Electoral Act does provide limited flexibility should an \nissue arise shortly before or on polling day.  \n\nThe most recent update to these provisions occurred in 2004, when following \nrecommendation of the AEC and the Committee, section 240A was inserted and section 241 \nwas amended to cover incidents such as a bomb threat, health hazard (the examples \nprovided to the Committee by the AEC at the time included ‘an anthrax scare’ or ‘dangerous \nanimal’), fire or fire alarms or sprinklers being set off.  \n\nTemporary suspension of polling (s240A) \nSection 240A gives presiding officers the power to temporarily suspend polling at their \npolling place for physical or voter safety reasons. The section provides riots, storms, fires, \nand health hazards as specific examples. \n\nPage 7\n\n\n--- Page 9 ---\n\nThis power only allows suspension of polling that has already commenced, and only allows \nfor suspensions until later the same day. \n\nAt the 2019 federal election, polling at the Sydney Central pre-poll voting centre (PPVC) at \nCentral Railway Station, Haymarket, was temporarily suspended after a bag was left \nunattended in the vicinity of the premises. Police attended promptly and polling resumed \napproximately fifteen minutes later. \n\nAdjournment of polling (s241) \nSection 241 gives presiding officers the power to adjourn polling at their polling place for \nphysical or voter safety reasons. Like section 240A, section 241 provides riots, storms, fires, \nand health hazards as specific examples. \n\nThis power only allows for adjournment of polling from one day to the next. For an \nadjournment to continue indefinitely, the presiding officer would need to repeatedly adjourn \npolling each day.  \n\nAt the 2019 federal election polling at the Crows Nest PPVC (NSW), a person died outside \nthe PPVC shortly after voting. Polling was adjourned to the following day. \n\nAdjournment of polling in other cases (s242) \nSection 242 gives presiding officers the general power to adjourn polling if, for any cause, a \npolling booth at a polling place is not opened on polling day. \n\nThis power only allows for adjournment for up to 21 days. \n\nExtension of time for holding an election (s286) \n\nSection 286 gives ‘the person causing the writ to be issued’ (that is, depending on the \nelectoral event involved, either the Governor-General, a state Governor, or the Speaker of \nthe House of Representatives) the broad power to extend the time for holding an election in \norder for ‘meeting any difficulty which might otherwise interfere’ with the election. \n\nThis power has rarely been used and, whilst broad, is not held by any AEC officer. For these \nreasons it is unlikely that the AEC can utilise this power at short notice.    \n\nPage 8\n\n\n--- Page 10 ---\n\nResponding to the COVID-19 \npandemic \n\nThe proposals to amend legislation outlined earlier in the submission are intended to apply \nto the inherent unknowns of most conceivable emergency situations.  \n\nThis said, the COVID-19 pandemic is an example of an emergency situation that, should the \nAEC’s proposals be legislated in a sufficiently swift manner, would allow the Electoral \nCommissioner to adopt modified arrangements for a future election or by-election that could \nimprove the accessibility and safety of an election that takes place during pandemics. \n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic is a highly unusual and unique emergency situation in that while its \nimpacts are evident and highly relevant to the conduct of an election, its length of duration is \nunknown. The pandemic may be with us for some time yet and its impacts for even longer.  \n\nThe AEC’s experience in the delivery of the by-election in the Division of Eden-Monaro \nprovided a sense of considerations that may apply to a federal election conducted during the \npandemic.  \n\nThere are also numerous recent examples of adaptation of election laws and processes to \nthe impacts of COVID-19 nationally and internationally. Some examples are outlined at \nAttachment A. \n\nEden-Monaro by-election \n\nThe AEC demonstrated its agility and professionalism in delivering the Eden-Monaro by-\nelection in the aftermath of the 2019/20 bushfire season and the COVID-19 pandemic. \nSurveys conducted following the election of both voters and the temporary election \nworkforce highlighted their satisfaction with the voting service and safety measures \nimplemented.  \n\nThe Eden-Monaro by-election held on 4 July 2020 was the first federal electoral event to be \nheld during a pandemic in 100 years and one of the first electoral events held in Australia \nduring the COVID-19 pandemic. As such the Eden-Monaro by-election provides an \nopportunity to analyse the implications COVID-19 may have for future electoral events, \nincluding the federal election. \n\nThe AEC set out its commitment to delivering the Eden-Monaro by-election to ensure the \nintegrity of electoral services and participation, and to protect the welfare of voters, staff and \nother participants in the COVID-19 pandemic environment in the Eden-Monaro by-election \nService Plan, which is provided at Attachment B. \n\nThe AEC conducted the by-election in accordance with the Electoral Act which provides for \nin-person voting and postal voting (subject to an application). There was no legislated \n\nPage 9\n\n\n--- Page 11 ---\n\nalternative open to the AEC. However, in evaluating the viability of options (such as 100 per \ncent postal voting, use of electronic voting options or expansion of telephone voting), it was \nclear that the business process in each case would require significant review and adjustment \nin order to facilitate the possibility of using these options. That is, the AEC would not simply \nneed the flexibility to expand or contract the various voting services, but also the flexibility to \nchange components of the process to facilitate an expansion of that scale, and the \nnecessary lead time in which to do that. \n\nConsultation: Delivering a by-election in the COVID-19 environment, in an area already \nimpacted by a natural disaster, required close consultation with a great number of \nstakeholders, including Commonwealth and state government agencies.  \n\nThe breadth and depth of stakeholder consultation and liaison required to run the by-election \nwas not only fundamentally important, but required significant time and resources. The AEC \nhad to work extremely hard, be flexible and agile to establish an acceptable way for voters to \nparticipate safely. \n\nExamples of some of the unprecedented consultation and coordination undertaken within the \ncompressed timeframes of an election included: \n\n  working with the Commonwealth Chief Medical Officer, NSW Chief Health Officer \nand ACT Chief Medical Officer and their respective Departments, as well as the \nAustralian Federal Police and NSW Police, to determine rapidly evolving \nCommonwealth, state and territory laws and health restrictions and determine \nappropriate safety measures to conduct the by-election during the pandemic \n\n  seeking approval from the NSW Minister for Health to be able to hold the by-election  \n\n  hosting a walk-through by the Commonwealth health advisor of the counting centre \nused for the by-election and a polling place mock-up, to demonstrate COVID-safety \nmeasures in place \n\n  seeking approval from the Secretary of the NSW Department of Education for \n\nschools to be used as polling booths \n\n  seeking assistance from the NSW Minister for Local Government to work with local \n\ncouncils regarding the use of facilities as polling places  \n\n  working with the NSW Police Commissioner and NSW Police in relation to the \n\nactivities permitted by the Electoral Act around distribution of how-to-vote material \nand the role of scrutineers, and the AEC approach to implementing the by-election \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nliaison with the National Bushfire Recovery Agency and Resilience NSW to facilitate \naccess to networks involved in supporting bushfire impacted communities \n\nliaison with Services Australia, which supported the AEC in areas affected by the \nbushfires by providing information from the AEC to clients affected by the bushfires, \nand  \n\nliaison with the Chief Executive of Australia Post to ensure there would be no \ndisruption to the delivery of postal votes. \n\nThis high-level activity was supported and arrangements implemented by significant levels of \nofficer-level liaison and coordination. \n\nCommunication: The pandemic has been an incredibly stressful time for the community. \nThe AEC aimed to reduce voter anxiety in our communications campaign by showing the \nAEC was prepared. The AEC’s expanded communication campaign included information \n\nPage 10\n\n\n--- Page 12 ---\n\nconcerning COVID-19 safety measures, with ‘Plan your vote’ as the key message. Public \nawareness survey results indicated: \n\n  at least 85 per cent of respondents were aware of the health measures in place \n\n  all measures made at least three-quarters of respondents feel safer \n\n  nearly all respondents who voted at voting centres were satisfied with the queue time \n\n(98 per cent, which in nearly all cases (96 per cent) was less than 15 minutes). \n\nAn awareness of the environmental context was key to the campaign’s success. \n\nTraining: Following announcement of the by-election, the AEC had to adapt quickly to \ndevelop and deliver appropriate and relevant training to support a COVID-safe by-election. \nThis included specialised training videos and eLearning courses on proper hand hygiene, \nthe use of PPE, cleaning surfaces in a polling place and safely managing queues of voters. \nThese new training resources complement the AEC’s existing suite of learning products, and \nwere produced by the AEC’s specialised National Training and Education Unit in only three \nweeks to meet the timeframe of the by-election. \n\nAdditionally, the AEC’s traditional face-to-face training of polling officials was successfully \ndelivered under new social distancing and hygiene requirements. The by-election \nrepresented the first time that 100 per cent of all polling officials were required to undertake \nat least some of their training online. The AEC’s Learning Management System was able to \nmonitor and report on training completion, to ensure that staff had completed all mandatory \nCOVID-safe courses before commencing work. \n\nVoting services: The AEC expanded the number of pre-poll voting centres compared with \nthe 2019 federal election (13, an increase of 5), had more centres open for the maximum \npre-poll period, and adjusted polling places (71, an increase of 2) to spread the flow of voters \nand communicated these to the electorate, along with the option to postal vote. On the basis \nof advice from the Chief Medical Officer, the AEC did not conduct mobile polling for the \nevent, and instead established a dedicated team to provide advice and facilitate postal \nvoting for aged care facilities and hospitals in the electorate. \n\nCost: The COVID-19 prevention measures had a clear impact on the cost of the by-election \nevent, almost doubling the total cost, to $3.954 million. In comparison, the by-elections held \nbetween 2016 and 2019 cost on average approximately $2 million each. While the AEC is \nassessing any potential efficiencies with what was implemented, the vast majority of \nmeasures will be necessary to implement unless there is a major change in the \nenvironmental risk. The likely impact on the federal election budget is clear. \n\nThe impact on cost is primarily driven by: additional polling locations throughout the pre-poll \nperiod and on polling day; additional staff required for sanitising, queue control and vote \nissuing and counting; PPE and other hygiene materials and services; as well as new \ncommunication and training packages.  \n\nPage 11\n\n\n--- Page 13 ---\n\nImpact on turnout: The by-election had a turnout of 89 per cent, one of the best rates of \nturnout for a by-election, and only a slight drop from the 2019 federal election turnout of 93 \nper cent for Eden-Monaro.  \n\nEligible Electors \n\nTurnout \n\nInformality \n\n2019 federal \nelection \n114,147 \n\n2020 by-\nelection \n114,178 \n\n93.31% \n\n89.13% \n\n6.80% \n\n6.71% \n\n% \nchange \n0.03% \n\n-4.18% \n\n-0.09% \n\nImpact on voting trends: The number of postal votes counted was 13,340, more than \ndouble that at the federal election.

Where the AEC is attempting to \nmanage competing stakeholder expectations, significant complexity is created. For example \nin the Eden Monaro by-election scrutiny centre, combining social distancing requirements \nwith the entitlement in the Electoral Act for candidates to be represented by one scrutineer \nper counting officer was challenging given the high number of scrutineers that presented on \nelection night. \n\nFacilitation of non-mainstream categories of electors: Careful consideration is required \nto the impact on services to groups such as overseas electors, voters in aged care facilities, \nhospitals, and remote communities. Without the ability to provide in-person voting services, \nonly postal voting is available, which is in turn also impacted by the pandemic situation and \nlikely to result in disenfranchisement of electors. For the Eden-Monaro by-election, only \n9  per cent of postal votes sent to overseas electors were admitted to the count, by \ncomparison the equivalent rate for the 2019 federal election was 33 per cent. \n\nComplexity in federal election planning: The AEC is rapidly approaching its minimum \npossible lead times to make large-scale adjustments to its polling premises footprint, staffing \nand budget estimates; to order required materials; and develop required training, procedures \nand communication packages. As such, the AEC must make some assumptions about the \npotential COVID-19 impact as at the earliest possible federal election date (August 2021) \nand plan for an event in a pandemic. \n\nPage 12\n\n\n--- Page 14 ---\n\nIt should be noted that the requirements and outcomes would certainly have been impacted \nif there were higher levels of community transmission at the time or different local legal \nrequirements in place. It was clear during the Eden-Monaro by-election and in the time \nfollowing, that the dynamic nature of the current environment adds a significant layer of \ncomplexity to planning for an approach to running a federal election in a COVID-19 \nenvironment. This would be compounded where different processes and different materials \nwere required in different states as tailoring training, materials and requirements adds \nadditional complexity, risk and cost.  \n\nData collection and analysis \n\nThe AEC has partnered with Deakin University over a number of election events to collect \ndata on process timings, run scenario modelling and use this information to help inform \ndecisions on the staffing profile, optimum staff numbers and count sizes. This modelling has \nthe dual aim of maximising efficiency and minimising queuing. In a COVID-19 scenario, \nminimising the amount of time people are gathered together in a queue is even more \nimportant.  \n\nData was collected during the Eden-Monaro by-election at a number of polling centres and \nat the counting centre. The data collected shows that issuing and counting processes took \nlonger than those from data collected at previous events. For example, on average the \nordinary vote issuing process took 16.5 seconds (or 46 per cent) longer than at the 2017 \nBennelong by-election.  \n\nIssuing times may be impacted by a number of COVID-19-related factors, for example: \n\n \n\n \n\nthe impact of using masks and screens on communication and efficient vote issuing \n\nissuing staff sanitising hands between voters \n\n  having the main queue outside and reducing the ability to use ‘mini-queues’ at each \n\nissuing point \n\n  handing out single-use pencils \n\n  cleaning issuing points and voting screens. \n\nThe AEC has extrapolated the data collected to model federal event scenarios. The table \nbelow illustrates some of the data modelling conducted to assess the impact of variables on \ntime in queue for a polling place expected to issue around 1,200 ordinary votes.  \n\nThe scenarios modelled varied the number of issuing officers, voting screens, frequency of \nhand sanitiser use, whether issuing officers provided a pencil to the elector, and whether the \nissuing point was covered during breaks taken by the issuing officer. The model then uses \ndata for elector arrival rates across the course of the day, and process timings to arrive at \nestimated average and maximum queues for each scenario. \n\nPage 13\n\n\n--- Page 15 ---\n\nTable 1 – Examples of scenarios for queue modelling, and entry queue wait time, \n1,200 ordinary votes threshold \n\nScenarios  \n\nAverage \n\nMaximum \n\nqueue \n\nqueue \n\n(minutes) \n\n(minutes) \n\nS21  4 ordinary vote issuing officers (IOs); 12 voting screens; IOs used hand \n\n23.33 \n\n55.42 \n\nsanitisation after every elector, provided pencil to elector, issuing point not \n\ncovered during breaks.  \n\nS24  4 IOs; 12 voting screens; IOs used hand sanitisation every 10th elector, \n\n15.99 \n\n45.18 \n\nprovided pencil to elector, issuing point not covered during breaks \n\nS25  4 IOs; 12 voting screens; IOs used hand sanitisation every 10th elector, did not \n\n13.12 \n\n40.15 \n\nprovide pencil to elector, issuing point not covered during breaks \n\nS26  4 IOs; 12 voting screens; IOs used hand sanitisation every 10th elector, did not \n\n3.38 \n\n16.07 \n\nprovide pencil to elector, issuing point covered during breaks \n\nS23  5 IOs; 13 voting screens; IOs used hand sanitisation after every elector, \n\n5.35 \n\n21.85 \n\nprovided pencil to elector, issuing point not covered during breaks \n\nS27  5 IOs; 13 voting screens; IOs used hand sanitisation every 10th elector, \n\n3.17 \n\n13.85 \n\nprovided pencil to elector, issuing point not covered during breaks \n\nS28  5 IOs; 13 voting screens; IOs used hand sanitisation every 10th elector, did not \n\n2.67 \n\n13.65 \n\nprovide pencil to elector, issuing point not covered during breaks \n\nS29  5 IOs; 13 voting screens; IOs used hand sanitisation every 10th elector, did not \n\n0.22 \n\n1.73 \n\nprovide pencil to elector, issuing point covered during breaks \n\nIn order to avoid queue lengths increasing to unacceptable levels, the data modelling shows \nthat it is necessary to reduce the table loading (the number of ballot papers each issuing \nofficer is expected to issue per day), thereby increasing the overall number of issuing staff. \nIn addition, the queue controller positions assigned to each polling place (which would \nnormally only be at busier locations) and new hygiene officer position would remain \nimperative.  \n\nEven in times of emergency and crisis, the AEC is of the view that evidence-based staffing \nestimations that prioritise safety and the efficient flow of voters through a polling place is \npreferred. The images from the recent United State elections of hours-long lines for voting in \nvarious states, such as in Georgia which experienced waiting times of up to 10 hours at one \nlocation on its first day of early voting, are scenes that would not be tolerated by most \nAustralians, even in extraordinary times. \n\nHaving multiple additional staff necessary at every polling location would have a significant \nimpact on cost, particularly when applied to a national electoral event. This equates to an \nestimated 30 per cent increase in polling staff required, costing approximately an additional \n$13 million.  \n\nSupply chain implications  \n\nCOVID-19 PPE procured for the Eden-Monaro by-election was appropriate and effective. \nThe addition of many new materials to AEC polling operations in such a short timeframe \n\nPage 14\n\n\n--- Page 16 ---\n\nrequired new policy development to support polling staff training requirements to create \neffective COVID safety practices and PPE use at polling locations.  \n\nProcurement and consumption analysis data from the Eden-Monaro event has been \npresented in Table 2 below. \n\nThe need for the AEC to continue to ensure its planned practices and PPE will assist it in \nproviding a safe environment for electors, staff and stakeholders needs to be of the highest \npriority for the duration of the pandemic. This is brought into sharp relief by reports this year \nfrom United States election administrators of polling officials and temporary staff falling ill \nwith COVID-19; of partial or full closure of polling and processing operations due to COVID-\n19 illness or close contact; and of the death of staff who worked at polling booths and in \nelections offices, due to COVID-19. \n\nFor the AEC, when considering supply of COVID-19 PPE for a federal election there are \nchallenges with procurement lead times, and supply chain risks to securing these items in \nthe timeframe necessary. Assurance of access to the National Medical Stockpile (controlled \nby the Department of Health) would be necessary to provide significant volumes of common \nPPE items (masks, wipes and sanitiser). This would also address the issue of consistent \nproduct quality as opposed to procuring multiple amounts of different products to meet the \noverall need. COVID-19 global demand for PPE may place supply chains originating \noverseas at risk of not being able to deliver in time for the AEC preparatory needs. \n\nAdditionally, the AEC will face significant challenges for bulk storage availability, and \nassociated costs, for these large volumes of PPE on top of the already large volumes of \nmaterial required for a federal election.  \n\nProcuring specialised materials for COVID-19 prevention may raise the cost of running a \nfederal election by in excess of $30 million. In addition, it is becoming clear that the cost of \nnormal election materials is impacted by the pandemic, where either the materials \nthemselves, or components to make them are often sourced overseas. \n\nTable 2: COVID-19 material required for the Eden-Monaro by-election \n\nProduct \n\nFacemask \n\nQuantity \n\nRequired \n\n11,000 \n\nRemarks \n\nNon-woven material – global shortage – increase \n\nin prices from China \n\nIssuing point screens -\n\n450 \n\nImproved, hardened designed product after by-\n\nSneeze screen \n\nelection experience.

We look forward to the Committee’s consideration of the necessary additional \noperational supports to safeguard democracy and enable the AEC to continue to deliver high \nintegrity elections, including during an emergency situation. \n\nPage 17\n\n\n--- Page 19 ---\n\nAttachment A - Responses to \nCOVID-19 \n\nThe World Health Organisation advises that the virus that causes COVID-19 commonly \nspreads between people through direct, indirect (through contaminated objects or surfaces), \nor close contact with infected people via mouth and nose secretions.1  \n\nThis poses fundamental public health challenges for the conduct of an election, which \ninvolves large gatherings of people for campaigning, canvassing, voting and counting, and \nthe handling of equipment and materials by multiple people. As one study noted, ‘More than \n40 points in the electoral process involve the assembly of people or transfer of objects and \ntherefore pose risks of virus transmission if no preventive measures are taken.’2 \n\nInitially, many governments around the world, including in Australia, took the decision to \npostpone planned elections. However, increasingly, many elections are proceeding with \ngovernments holding national or subnational elections as originally planned despite \nconcerns related to COVID-19, and holding elections that were initially postponed. \n\nThe experience of selected fellow members of the Electoral Council of Australia and New \nZealand (ECANZ) in dealing with scheduled electoral events in 2020 has shown a diversity \nof service models and regulatory approaches to dealing with election delivery in the context \nof rapidly evolving conditions and other challenges associated with the pandemic. \n\nQueensland local government elections were the first large-scale elections conducted in \nAustralia following the declaration of a pandemic, with election day falling on 28 March 2020. \n\nThe elections were delivered in a highly dynamic and uncertain environment. This included \nthe declaration of a pandemic by the WHO during the election period, and urgent legislative \nand regulatory changes impacting electoral processes that came into effect after early voting \nhad commenced on 16 March. Notably, the amended legal framework provided for a \ntemporary regulation making power, and enabled the commission to issue Directions \nconcerning the distribution or display of how-to-vote cards or other election material.3 \n\nThe election saw a significant shift in the voting patterns of the Queensland public compared \nwith previous elections:  \n\n  1.2 million people who voted during the two-week early voting period (500,000 in \n\n2016)  \n\n  470,000 postal votes were returned of the 570,000 issued (320,000 returned in 2016)  \n\n  37,000 people who cast a telephone vote (500 in 2016), and  \n\n1  World Health Organization, Q&A: How is COVID-19 transmitted?, www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/q-a-how-is-covid-19-\ntransmitted, accessed 11 November 2020 \n2 International Foundation for Electoral Systems, Safeguarding Health and Elections, May 2020, p. 4, \nhttps://www.ifes.org/sites/default/files/ifes_covid19_briefing_series_safeguarding_health_and_elections_may_2020.pdf, \naccessed 11 November 2020. \n3 See Public Health and Other Legislation (Public Health Emergency) Amendment Act 2020 (Qld). \n\nPage 18\n\n\n--- Page 20 ---\n\n  750,000 people who voted on election day at a polling booth (1.6 million in 2016). \n\nVoting for the New Zealand general election took place from Saturday 3 October to \nSaturday 17 October. The timing of the election period was delayed for four weeks on 17 \nAugust 2020 following the reemergence of COVID-19 in New Zealand.  \n\nThe legal framework for elections in New Zealand provides powers to respond to defined \nemergency situations. Sections 195 to 195E of the Electoral Act 1993 (NZ), sets out powers \nfor responding to an unforeseen or unavoidable disruption that is likely to prevent voters \nvoting at a polling place or pose a risk to the proper conduct of an election. The provisions:  \n\n  define the situations when provisions for managing polling disruptions may be used \n\n  provide for the use of alternative voting processes to respond to polling disruptions \n\n  provide for an adjournment power \n\n  outline how the effect of polling disruptions on the preliminary vote count is to be \n\nmanage. \n\nNotwithstanding these powers, Regulations were also made which provided for special \nmeasures during a pandemic.4  \n\nMeasures implemented at the election included: \n\n  voters were encouraged to vote early  \n\n  an increase in voting locations  \n\no \n\no \n\nthere were around 750 advanced voting locations (up from 485 at the 2017 \ngeneral election), and this doubled to around 1,500 voting places on the \nweekend before election day \nthere were expected to be around 2,500 voting booths on election day (up \nfrom 2,378 in 2017) 5 \n\n \n\n \n\nthose who were unable to get to a voting place could apply for a postal vote, or ask \nsomeone to bring them their voting papers6 \n\ntelephone dictation voting, normally only available to voters with particular disabilities, \nfor use by voters who were in COVID-19 related managed isolation and quarantine \nfacilities.   \n\nPreliminary election results reported indicated:  \n\n  over 60 per cent of the 3.2 million enrolled voters cast an advance vote (1,976,996, \n\nup from 1,240,740 in 2017)  \n\n \n\nthe largest number of advance votes received was on Saturday 10 October, a week \nbefore the election.7 \n\nElection day for the Queensland state election occurred on Saturday 31 October 2020. \n\n4 See COVID-19 Public Health Response (Election and Referendums) Order 2020 (NZ). \n5 Jason Walls, Election officials are expecting the highest early voting turnout in history this election, New Zealand Herald, \n27  July 2020 2:20pm, https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=12351328, accessed 11 November \n2020. \n6 New Zealand Electoral Commission, 2020 General Election: COVID-19, https://vote.nz/voting/2020-general-election/covid-19/, \naccessed 10 November 2020.  \n7 Radio New Zealand, Election 2020: Advance votes total just under 2 million, 17 October 2020, \nhttps://www.rnz.co.nz/news/political/428576/election-2020-advance-votes-total-just-under-2-million, accessed 30 October 2020.  \n\nPage 19\n\n\n--- Page 21 ---\n\nDue to the ongoing risk posed by COVID-19, the Electoral Commission of Queensland \nadapted its election delivery model. The model was supported by legislative enhancements \nresulting from passage of the Electoral and Other Legislation (Accountability, Integrity and \nOther Matters) Amendment Act 2020. This Act included amendments to the Electoral Act \n1992 (Qld) providing extra flexibility in the statutory framework for the elections including:  \n\n \n\nflexibility to change dates for election milestones contained in the writ  \n\n  ability for the ECQ to issue notices that change timeframes for postal vote \n\napplications and expand eligibility for telephone voting  \n\n  power for the ECQ to issue directions regulating the handing out of election materials \n\nor how-to-vote cards near polling place and the activity of scrutineers, and  \n\n  ability to declare certain classes of voters or electorates to automatically receive a \n\npostal vote by regulation. \n\nMeasures in place for the election included: \n\n \n\nthe election was conducted over an election period rather than focussing on an \nelection day  \n\n  expanded early voting options were available across the two-week early voting \n\nperiod, with extra centres established, and extended operating hours, including from \n9am to 4pm on the Saturday prior to election day  \n\n  electors were, for the first time, able to apply for a postal vote before the issue of the \n\nwrit with applications opening from 14 September 2020 \n\n  declaration of additional categories of electors eligible for telephone voting, and  \n\n  special arrangements for postal voting in aged care and rehabilitation facilities which \n\nwould usually receive a mobile polling service. \n\nWhile the election count is still being finalised, pre-poll and postal votes will exceed the \nvolumes received at the March 2020 election, with many more people casting their vote \nbefore election day than on election day.  \n\nBeyond ECANZ, Elections Canada is presently engaging with the Canadian Parliament in \nrelation to legislative responses that may assist it deliver an accessible, safe and secure \nelection. \n\nKey elements of its suggested changes, which it proposes to apply to the next general \nelection only, include a focus on: \n\n  extending the voting period, shifting polling day from one 12-hour period on a \n\nMonday to 8 hours per day on a Saturday and a Sunday \n\n \n\nflexibility in approach to aged care facility voting, enabling the Chief Electoral Officer \nto prescribe the timing and manner in which voting occurs at these facilities \n\n  extending the existing ‘adaptation power’ in section 17 of the Canada Elections Act to \n\ninclude all areas within the Chief Electoral Officer’s mandate. \n\nPage 20\n\n\n--- Page 22 ---\n\nAttachment B – Eden-Monaro by-\nelection Service Plan \n\nPage 21\n\n\n--- Page 23 ---\n\n28 May 2020 \n\nEden-Monaro \nby-election \nService Plan \n\nMay 2020\n\n\n--- Page 24 ---\n\nForeword  \n\nThe AEC is committed to providing the highest standard of electoral services for the Eden-\nMonaro by-election. During the COVID-19 pandemic this includes a range of safety \nmeasures for voters, AEC staff and other participants.  \n\nWe have introduced a range of COVID-19 safety measures at voting venues and also \nthrough the entire by-election process, including the receipt and declaration of nominations, \nthe management of election materials and at our counting centre.  \n\nThe operating model for this by-election includes social distancing and hygiene measures \nthat conform with federal and local health advice and are also within the legislative \nframework of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918. The infection-control advice the AEC is \nfollowing has been provided by the Australian Government’s Chief Medical Officer, and \nrelevant NSW and ACT health authorities. \n\nIt is also important to note these measures, which must be enacted to protect the \ncommunity, will inevitably slow the voting process. Whilst we are implementing measures to \ntry and reduce this impact, the AEC thanks all electors and participants for their patience and \nadherence to the new measures in the polling place and at our count centre. \n\nThe counting of votes will also take longer due to the measures in place in polling places and \nat our counting centre. The expected increase in postal and pre-poll votes cast will also \nimpact the speed of the count, noting the legislative requirement to wait 13 days after \nelection day for the return of postal votes.  \n\nAs a result, it is likely to take longer to formally declare a final result in this by-election \ncompared with previous federal by-elections but, as per our normal practice, the AEC will do \neverything possible to provide an indicative result on polling night. \n\nThe AEC is committed to continuous improvement. This service plan outlines the key \nelection services and standards that will underpin the AEC’s delivery of the 2020 Eden-\nMonaro by-election during a pandemic. \n\nShould you have any comments on the service plan or the AEC’s delivery on these \ncommitments, I would ask you to take the time to let us know through our online enquiry \nform so we can consider your feedback as we continue to improve the delivery of election \nservices. \n\nTom Rogers  \nElectoral Commissioner \n\nPage 1 \n\nEden-Monaro by-election Service Plan\n\n\n--- Page 25 ---\n\nCOVID-19 related measures  \nfor the Eden-Monaro by-election \n\nThe operating model for the by-election will see measures introduced that conform with \nfederal and local health advice and are applied within the Commonwealth Electoral Act \n1918. The infection-control advice the AEC is following has been provided by the Australian \nGovernment’s Chief Medical Officer, and reviewed by NSW and ACT health authorities. \n\nIt is also important to note these measures, which must be put in place to protect the \ncommunity, will inevitably slow the voting process. Whilst we are implementing measures to \ntry and reduce this impact, the AEC thanks all electors and participants for their patience and \nadherence to the new measures in the polling places and at our count centre. \n\nThe counting of votes will also take longer due to the measures in place in our polling places \nand at our counting centre. The expected increase in postal and pre-poll votes cast will also \nimpact the speed of the count, noting also the legislative requirement to wait 13 days after \nelection day for the return of postal votes. As a result, it is likely to take longer to formally \ndeclare a final result in this by-election compared with previous federal by-elections but, as \nper our normal practice, the AEC will do everything possible to provide an indicative result \non polling night. \n\nThis document outlines the ways in which the key processes in the operation of the by-\nelection will be modified or enhanced.  \n\nTaking nominations  \n\nPeople wishing to nominate for the by-election will need to make an appointment with the \nDivisional Returning Officer for Eden-Monaro before attending the AEC office to lodge their \nnomination forms. At the office, hand sanitiser will be available at the entrance, on all \nmeeting tables, and on the way out. AEC staff may wear surgical masks, and social \ndistancing of 1.5 metres will be in place wherever possible between staff and nominees.  \n\nWhere possible AEC staff will also seek to minimise the amount of back-and-forth handling \nof forms. Contactless Eftpos facilities will be available for candidates to pay their nomination \nfee. \n\nBallot draw \n\nSocial-distancing rules will apply to everybody attending the ballot draw and seating will be \nappropriately spaced. Hand sanitiser will be at the entrance and exit of the venue. \n\nAEC staff performing the ballot draw will observe necessary personal hygiene measures and \nsanitise the equipment used. \n\nPage 2 \n\nEden-Monaro by-election Service Plan\n\n\n--- Page 26 ---\n\nDuring training \n\nOur online training suite has been enhanced to include a new online training module on the \nrequired health measures put in place for this by-election. This will be mandatory for all AEC \nstaff and temporary election workers working at this by-election. Where AEC staff conduct \nface-to-face training, social-distancing rules will be observed and all of the health measures \nthat will be applied throughout the by-election will also be observed throughout the \ncorresponding practical exercises. Hand sanitiser will be available on arrival and exit, and \nparticipants will wash or sanitise their hands before and after each practical exercise. \n\nVoting for residents of aged care facilities and hospital patients \n\nThe AEC is very conscious of the health and safety of voters during the by-election; \nparticularly those who are potentially vulnerable to infection. Accordingly, we have adopted \nspecial measures to protect residents of aged care facilities and hospitals in the Eden-\nMonaro electorate during these extraordinary times, whilst still ensuring they can exercise \ntheir right to vote. Based on medical advice, the AEC will be providing effective alternatives \nto mobile polling (which are normally a feature of electoral events). Specifically, the AEC has \nestablished a support team for these facilities and has already provided enrolment forms and \ngeneral postal vote applications for residents to complete and return to the AEC. Residents \nof aged care facilities and hospitals will have the option to either vote via a postal vote \ndelivered directly to their facility; telephone voting for those who are blind or low vision; or by \nattending a polling location (depending on their personal circumstances), which will have \nhealth and safety measures in place.  \n\nThe AEC will also maintain ongoing contact with aged care facilities and relevant hospitals in \nthe Division of Eden-Monaro to provide support, answer questions and deliver additional \nenrolment and postal vote application forms, if needed.  \n\nBlind and Low Vision \n\nVoters who are blind or have low vision can cast a vote in secret by telephone from any \nlocation for the Eden-Monaro by-election. \n\nTelephone voting is a simple two-step process, voters who are blind or have low vision will \nbe invited to register for a telephone vote by calling a dedicated 1800 number for this \nelection. They will not need to give their name when they vote using the telephone voting \nservice. Their registration number and pin will be used to mark their name off the electoral \nroll, ensuring the voter’s identity remains secret. \n\nPostal voting \n\nPostal voting will be an important voting option available to eligible Eden-Monaro electors. \nPostal voting helps minimise contact and movement, and given the COVID-19 environment, \nit is anticipated that a greater number of voters will meet the eligibility criteria under the \nlegislation to apply for a postal vote in this by-election. \n\nPage 3 \n\nEden-Monaro by-election Service Plan\n\n\n--- Page 27 ---\n\nVoting at polling places \n\nIf on arrival voters are not able to immediately enter the \npolling place, they will be required to queue outside \nwhere social-distancing rules will be in place. Extra \nqueue controllers that have been appropriately trained \nin social-distancing rules and the traditional “six-metre \nrule” regarding campaigners will be outside the polling \nplace to ensure adherence to these important \nmeasures. \n\nThe number of voters entering a polling place will be \ncounted at the door to limit the number of people inside \nthe polling place at any one time. Hand sanitiser will be \navailable at the entrance to the polling place and at \neach ballot-paper issuing point and when exiting the \npolling place. Signage about hygiene and social \ndistancing will be prominent in the polling place for \nvoters and staff.  \n\nWhere possible a “sneeze shield” will be installed at all ballot-paper issuing points, and \nissuing tables will be sprayed regularly with sanitising spray throughout the day and \nwhenever issuing staff are rotated. Voters will be encouraged to bring their own pencil or pen \nto the polling place but electors will also be offered a single-use pencil when handed their \nballot papers. \n\nVoting screens will separated by a distance of 1.5 metres and the plastic writing surface \ninserted into the voting screen will be regularly cleaned with sanitising spray throughout \npolling day. \n\nAEC staff may wear surgical masks and will under no circumstances share their bibs or \nlanyards with other staff. Bio-hazard bags will be used for the disposal of surgical masks, \ngloves and cleaning cloth waste.  \n\nPhoto opportunities of the inside of a polling place will only be allowed when there is a \nsufficiently low number of voters present so social distancing can be maintained, and when \nthe Officer-in-Charge approves. \n\nCampaigning at polling places \n\nWhilst the AEC has no legislative jurisdiction or responsibility for campaigners outside six \nmetres of the entrance to the polling place, we acknowledge that the current COVID-19 \nenvironment may impact on their ability to hand our how-to-vote cards as they ordinarily \nwould for any other federal electoral event. Parties and candidates will need to ensure that \nthose campaigning on their behalf near a polling venue have fully informed themselves of \nNSW Government health restrictions and laws in place regarding social distancing, and that \nthey abide by these directives. \n\nAcknowledging the challenges faced by parties and candidates for this by-election, the AEC \nhas decided to assist parties and candidates by seeking to collect the details of all \ncandidate’s official campaign website addresses at the time of nomination. The AEC will \n\nPage 4 \n\nEden-Monaro by-election Service Plan\n\n\n--- Page 28 ---\n\nprovide a link to these websites which will be available on the AEC website alongside the \ncandidate’s details. \n\nCounting on election night at polling places \n\nAfter 6pm, when the counting commences at polling places, hand sanitiser for all polling \nplace officials and scrutineers will be at the polling place entry point, at each sorting and \ncounting table, and at the exit to the polling place.  \n\nBallot boxes will be cleaned with sanitising spray before they are opened for counting on the \ntables. Staff will sanitise their hands immediately before and after they handle ballot-box \ntags. \n\nSurgical masks may be worn by both staff and scrutineers, and no sharing of bibs or \nlanyards will be allowed. If practicable, “sneeze shields” may be used at each counting and \nsorting table to separate scrutineers from counting staff. \n\nThere will be signs outlining the hygiene and social distancing rules, and those who do not \nadhere to the rules will be requested to leave.  \n\nThe area used for polling and counting at each polling place will be fully cleaned after \nelection night. \n\nCounting at AEC out-posted centres \n\nHand sanitiser will be available at the entry and exit of the out-posted centre (OPC), at each \nsorting and counting table and in break-out areas.  \n\nThe outside surfaces of election materials returned to the OPC – including ballot boxes \ntransported on election night from pre-poll voting centres – will be cleaned with sanitising \nspray on arrival. \n\nBallot boxes will be cleaned with sanitising spray before opening, and staff will wash or \nsanitise their hands after handling ballot-box tags, and before and after each count of ballot \npapers. Surgical masks may be worn both by staff and scrutineers and, if practicable, \n“sneeze shields” will be used at each counting and sorting table to separate scrutineers from \ncounting staff. \n\nThe OPC will be set up with prominent hygiene signage and 1.5-metre standard markings on \nthe floor. There will be regular cleaning of surfaces, equipment and break-out areas during \noperational hours. Only single-use water bottles will be allowed, all plates and cutlery must \nbe disposable, and there will be no provision for the serving of coffee or tea inside. \n\nAll equipment used for scrutiny will be cleaned before installing and it will also be regularly \ncleaned during use and before return. Additional Security Officers and Hygiene Officers will \nbe present in the OPC to ensure everyone’s safety and adherence to the health measures. \nThey will be wearing distinctive bibs.  \n\nDeep cleaning of the OPC will occur overnight and at the conclusion of the counting. \nBiohazard bags will be used to dispose of all waste from the clearing process.  \n\nPage 5 \n\nEden-Monaro by-election Service Plan\n\n\n--- Page 29 ---\n\nWhen counting postal votes \n\nThe outside of all transport containers used by Australia Post or couriers will be sprayed with \nsanitising spray prior to opening. \n\nHand sanitiser will be regularly applied by staff before opening batches of postal-vote \nenvelopes and the extraction of ballot papers. Staff will also wash or sanitise their hands \nimmediately before and after each count or when they handle batches of ballot papers.  \n\nSurgical masks should be worn by both staff and scrutineers.  \n\nAt the declaration of the poll \n\nSocial-distancing rules will apply to all in attendance and seating will be appropriately \nspaced. Hand sanitiser will be at the entrance and exit of the venue. \n\nPage 6 \n\nEden-Monaro by-election Service Plan\n\n\n--- Page 30 ---\n\nAchieving the AEC Service Standards  \n\nThe AEC is committed to upholding five key service standards. \n\nThe AEC will support effective participation in the Eden-Monaro by-election by ensuring \ninformation provided to the voting public and candidates is timely, accurate, comprehensive \nand easy to understand. \n\nThe AEC will conduct a public information and education campaign and will deliver an official \nguide for the by-election to households across the division.

We do offer phone \nvoting for those who are blind or have low vision, and those in \nAntarctica.  \n\nWhat about people who \nspeak another language? \n\nInfo in 33 languages is here. When calling 1800 413 960 to register or \nvote, people can ask for an interpreter who speaks their language to \njoin the call.  \n\nWhat do you do with \ninformation from when I \nregister?  \n\nWe don’t ask for personal details when you call. You get a registration \nnumber, which you quote when you call to vote. This ensures your vote \nremains secret.  \n\nHow can I make a \ncomplaint? \n\nYou can send an email to phonevote@aec.gov.au \n\n4\n\n\n\n--- Page 1 ---\n\nMedia responses – secure telephone voting \n\nTopline talking points \n\n•  Telephone voting has been introduced as an emergency measure and is strictly only for \n\npeople who have tested positive to COVID after 6pm on the Tuesday evening before polling \nday.  \n\n• \n\nIt will be available from 8.30am Thursday 19 May. \n\n•  People who tested positive from Saturday 14 May until then should apply for a postal vote.  \n\n•  To access the service electors must prove their eligibility and must have registered their \n\npositive COVID-19 test – either a PCR or RAT – with their state or territory health authority.  \nThis is a mandatory requirement. \n\n• \n\nImages of the ballot papers will be available for voters to view on the AEC website, to ensure \nthose voting by telephone are able to complete the process as easily as possible. \n\n•  Voter verification will work the same for telephone voting as any other method – voters will \nnot be required to present identification in order to have their vote marked against the \nelectoral roll. Voters will be making a legal declaration about their identity, as they do when \nvoting in person or by post, and that they have not previously voted in this election.  \n\n•  Previously, telephone voting was limited to voters who are blind or have low vision with just \n\nover 2,000 votes taken via telephone in 2019.  \n\n• \n\nIt is an emergency measure only and there will likely be long wait times to vote with this \nservice.   \n\n•  Anyone who is able to visit a polling place should do so. There are more COVID-19 safety \nmeasures in place than your trip to the local shops – so you can feel safe to turn up and \nvote.  \n\nHow secure telephone voting works \n\nHow will telephone voting work? \n\nThere’s two steps for secure telephone voting. \n\nFirst, people register to use the service on the AEC website. Voters will need to provide \nevidence of being COVID-19 positive and make a declaration about their eligibility.  \n\nOnce the registration form has been submitted, people will get a registration number sent by \nSMS or email. When they call to cast their vote, people will quote this registration number \nrather than their name and address to protect the secrecy of their vote. \n\nIf people don’t have internet access, they can register over the phone. But we expect the vast \nmajority to register online. \n\nWe’re asking people to visit the AEC website and look at an image of the ballot papers and \nconsider their preferences before calling to vote. This will help make the voting process quicker \nand reduce wait times for the service. \n\nThen they will call 1800 413 960. They quote their registration number and a call centre \noperator will record the vote. \n\nHow do people prove they’re COVID-19 positive? \n\nPeople can only use the telephone voting service if they have registered their positive COVID-19 \ntest – either a PCR or RAT – with their state or territory health authority. They’ll also need to \nprovide evidence of their PCR, such as date and time of positive test result, or evidence of their \nRAT, such as serial number.\n\n\n--- Page 2 ---\n\nHow can close contacts vote? \n\nClose contacts no longer need to isolate. This means they can attend a polling place to vote in \nperson. We expect they will follow local health authority guidelines and take appropriate \nCOVID-19 safety measures. \n\nWhat happens if a close contact has COVID-19 symptoms? \n\nThe AEC is recommending people plan their vote. If people don’t think they will be able to \nvote in person on election day, they may be eligible to apply for a postal vote or attend one of \nour early voting centres. If a family member has COVID-19 in the week before the election, \nclose contacts may consider voting early in case they become symptomatic. \n\nHow will COVID-19 positive people know about the service? \n\nThe AEC is running a voter services campaign, which explains to people their voting options if \nthey don’t think they will be able to vote in person on election day. This is available in up to 33 \nlanguages. \n\nIn addition, everyone who registers a positive COVID-19 test result with their state or territory \ngovernment will receive information on how to vote while in isolation. State and territory \nCOVID-19 web pages and call centres will also direct people to the AEC website to check their \nvoting options. \n\nWhat are the operating hours? \n\nOnline registration  \nOpens \nCloses \nPhone registration \n\nPhone voting  \n\nWednesday 18 May  \nSaturday 21 May  \nThursday 19 May   \nFriday 20 May \nSaturday 21 May \nThursday 19 May \nFriday 20 May \nSaturday 21 May \n\n6.01pm AEST  \n4pm AEST \n8.30am to 5.30pm local time \n8.30am to 5.30pm local time \n8am local time to 4pm AEST \n8.30am to 5.30pm local time \n8.30am to 6pm local time \n8am to 6pm local time \n\nIf a registered COVID-19 positive telephone voter is on the line when voting closes at 6pm on \nelection day they will be able to cast their vote, just as is the case for people in the queue at \n6pm at an election day polling place.  \n\nIntegrity of the service \n\nDoes this open up the possibility of people voting twice? \n\nNo. As part of the registration process, the voter’s name will be marked off the roll in real time. \nIf the voter has already voted they will not be able to register. \n\nVoters also have to make a declaration when they call to vote that they haven’t voted before in \nthis election. \n\nHow is the AEC ensuring electoral integrity given there will be non-AEC call centres taking votes? \n\nAll policies, procedures and training materials have been developed by the AEC in line with \nour existing election and call centre management procedures. As you’d expect, they’re \nstandardised, robust, and align with the electronically assisted voting provisions in the \nElectoral Act. \n\nIf pushed \nAll staff working on the call centre are employees of the Australia Public Service and have \nundertaken specific training for this service. They also must have signed a Political Neutrality \ndisclosure, and there are offences in the Regulation and lawful declarations that the elector \nneeds to make. Any breach is a criminal offence.\n\n\n--- Page 3 ---\n\nHow is the service scrutineered? \n\nCandidates and party-appointed scrutineers can observe the telephone voting process, as is the \ncase with every voting process we deliver. This is an important part of the transparency of \nAustralia’s election delivery. Voters can request a scrutineer not to observe their phone call, if \nthat’s their preference. \n\nThe ballot paper handling requirements in call centres will be subject to the same stringent \nballot paper handling and reconciliation requirements as in-person polling places.  \n\nVotes will only be counted following secure return to the relevant divisional offices, which is \nalso conducted under scrutineer observation. \n\nHow will the secure telephone votes be counted? \n\nAfter the close of voting on election day, all the envelopes will be sorted, reconciled and \npacked for secure dispatch to their home division. There, they’ll be receipted, opened and the \nballot papers counted. \n\nOperation of the service \n\nWho is delivering the call centre? \n\nThe secure telephone voting service is being managed by the Australian Electoral Commission, \nusing a number of Commonwealth department call centres.  \n\nOperators, like all people involved in the delivery of the election, are required to sign a political \nneutrality declaration – a statement that they will undertake their duties with impartiality.  \n\nHow many people do you think will cast a vote by phone? \n\nCOVID-19 case numbers continue to fluctuate. We’re working closely with the Department of \nHealth to model expected demand.  \n\nIf pushed \n\nThe one thing we know is that COVID-19 is unpredictable. In saying that, if people are tracking \nthe number of daily COVID-positive case numbers this should give them an idea of the number \nof calls we’re expecting.  \n\nWhile experts are predicting numbers to plateau, we’re building a service that will cater for \nabove the expected demand, so that there’s coverage if a new variant emerges or numbers \nunexpectedly rise in the week prior to the election. \n\nIf further pushed \n\nWe’ll have approximately 7000 operators for this service. While a significant delivery scale has \nbeen stood up in a short time frame, we’ve been very upfront that the nature of the service \nwill mean people may experience a wait.  \n\nHow many how people voted by phone? \n\n(From Sunday) XX people registered to vote by phone. We’re still reconciling how many then \ncalled to cast their vote by phone. \n\nLast updated: 11 May 2022 \n\nClearance: Kath Gleeson\n\n\n\n--- Page 1 ---\n\nKEY MESSAGING \n2022 federal election telephone voting system \nLast updated 28 March 2022 – will be updated progressively as more details are confirmed \n\nAbout the telephone voting service \n\n•  We know that some people will be in isolation or quarantine under a public health order during \n\nthe election and will not be able to vote in person. \n\n•  People can check if they are eligible to vote early if they don’t think they can make it to a \n\npolling place on election day.

The telephone voting \nservice is no different. Personal details are only used to register as an eligible voter.  Our voter \nregistration systems are designed to protect personal details and have been independently \nassessed for security compliance. \n\n•  Telephone voting will involve a two-step process to ensure anonymity of voters and the secrecy \n\nof the vote.  \n\no  Voters will register, provide a PIN and receive a voting registration number. This will de-\n\nidentify the voter and ensure confidentiality of votes.  \n\no  Voters then call the telephone service to vote. \no  Voters must provide the PIN and registration number before they can vote. Votes remain \nsecret because the AEC voting assistant will not know the voter’s name and address.\n\n\n--- Page 2 ---\n\nBallot paper security \n\n•  The AEC’s Ballot Paper Principles apply, and ballot paper security arrangements will be consistent \n\nwith other polling places. \n\n•  A Quality Assurance framework will be in place to ensure procedural integrity. \n\n•  All call centre staff will have to declare political neutrality. \n\n•  The AEC systems used for registration have had all appropriate cyber security assessments. \n\n•  The electoral roll is checked for instances of prior voting in the election when they register and \n\nagain when they call to vote. No-one will be able to cast a vote by telephone if they have already \nbeen marked as voting. \n\nAEC experience in telephone voting \n\n•  Telephone voting is a service that the AEC has operated previously for Australian voters who are \n\nblind or have low vision. \n\n•  The telephone voting service for COVID-affected electors is based on these existing services and \n\nhas been adapted for scale and eligibility requirements. \n\n•  The telephone voting service for voters who are blind or have low vision and voters in Antarctica \nwill operate separately and will not be affected by the expanded service for voters affected by \nCOVID-19. \n\nScrutineering and the telephone voting service \n\n•  A process will be available for scrutineers.  \n\n•  Scrutineering is a fundamental part of the delivery of Australian federal elections. This is being \nplanned as part of the scaling up of the telephone voting service for this once-in-a-generation \npandemic federal election.  \n\nMore information \n\n•  More information will be made available to eligible people ahead of the telephone voting period. \n\n• \n\nInformation on other ways to vote are at aec.gov.au\n\n\n--- Page 3 ---\n\nQUESTIONS AND ANSWERS \n\nIs this a form of online voting? \n\nNo. Legislation does not currently allow for any form of online voting. The only part of this process to \ntake place online is a registration option. Each vote call results in a physical ballot paper being filled \nin and counted in the same way as all other ballot papers. \n\nWhat’s the process to ensure the vote is taken correctly by the call centre operators? \n\nThe call centre operator reads back the preferences to the voter once finished, and voters can \nrequest for a different operator to do this. All operators will be required to declare political \nneutrality. \n\nWhat if the call wait times are longer than people are willing to wait? \n\nVoting is compulsory, however voters with a valid and sufficient reason for not voting will not be \nfined. Voters in this situation can tell us why they cannot vote via email (TBC). \n\nVoters in the telephone queue at 6pm local time will still be able to cast their vote, similar to the \nqueue at in person polling places. \n\nHow is the AEC ensuring my COVID-19 information is protected? \n\nVoters’ COVID-19 health information is needed to determine eligibility for telephone voting under \nthe relevant laws including the Electoral Legislation Amendment (COVID Enfranchisement) Bill 2022. \n\nThe AEC adheres to the Privacy Act and Australian Privacy Principles to ensure personal information \nis protected. This includes the conduct of a third-party privacy impact assessment.\n\n\n\n--- Page 1 ---\n\nElection Contact Centre Application Home Page:- \nCovid-19 Secure Telephone Voting Information \nNotices \n\nEligibility to phone vote  \n\nIssue:  \nThe Electoral Commissioner Tom Rogers has this morning signed a brief to Government recommending \nthat the eligibility for telephone voting services for people who have tested positive to COVID-19 be \nexpanded. \n\nThis would see electors who have tested positive to COVID-19 since Saturday 14 May 2022 being able to \nalso phone vote. \n\n(Further information will be provided shortly) \n\nEligibility to phone vote  \n\nIssue:  \nThe Electoral Commissioner Tom Rogers has this morning signed a brief to Government recommending \nthat the eligibility for telephone voting services for people who have tested positive to COVID-19 be \nexpanded. \n\n•  At this stage eligibility to use the telephone voting service remains that electors need to have \n\ntested positive to COVID-19 after 6pm Tuesday 17 May  \n\n• \n\nIf this changes today there will be public communications to advise the detail \n\n•  AEC general enquiries staff are not to provide the Secure Telephone Voting number for COVID-19 \naffected electors to callers who do not meet the criteria.

Postal voters \n\n1.1  There are two categories of postal voters:  \n\n• \n\n• \n\nThose people that apply for a postal vote for a particular federal event. These people have to \napply to be sent voting papers for the applicable event. \n\nThose people that are registered as a General Postal Voter and have a registration code against \ntheir enrolment record. These people are automatically sent voting papers at the time of any \nelection.  \n\n2.  Postal voting for a particular event \n\n2.1  A person may apply for a postal vote on specified grounds. Those grounds are set out in Schedule 2 \n\nto the Electoral Act. In general terms, an elector may apply for a postal vote if, on polling day, they: \n\n• \n\n• \n\n• \n\n• \n\n• \n\n• \n\n• \n\n• \n\n• \n\n• \n\nare outside the electorate where they are enrolled to vote \n\nare more than 8km from a polling place \n\nare travelling \n\nare unable to leave their workplace to vote \n\nare seriously ill, infirm or due to give birth shortly (or caring for someone who is) \n\nare a patient in hospital and can't vote at the hospital \n\nhave religious beliefs that prevent them from attending a polling place \n\nare in prison serving a sentence of less than three years or otherwise detained \n\nare a silent elector \n\nhave a reasonable fear for their safety. \n\n2.2  A postal vote application (PVA) must be in writing on the form approved by the Electoral \n\nCommissioner (EC) which includes a declaration by the applicant that they are entitled to apply for a \npostal vote. A PVA may also be lodged online. \n\n2.3  An application may not be made until after the public announcement of the proposed date for polling \n\nor after the issue of a writ for an election or referendum (whichever is the earlier) (s 184 and Schedule \n2 of the Electoral Act). An announcement concerning an intended date for polling does not necessarily \nmeet the requirements of s 184 of the Electoral Act. The AEC may issue advice clarifying whether \nPVAs may be accepted in such instances. \n\nNote: The following clause will be affected by the decision that has been made not to visit said facilities for \nthe next election due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Further details on what arrangements will be made for \nthese electors will be released once confirmed. \n\n2.4  As soon as the public announcement of the election date is made, every effort must be made to \n\nensure that PVAs are also made available at places where mobile polling facilities may not be \nprovided during the election period, for example:  \n\n3       POLICY POSTAL VOTING\n\n\n--- Page 4 ---\n\n• \n\n• \n\n• \n\nnursing homes \n\nhospitals \n\nhigh-care facilities (including those in retirement villages and residential mental health facilities) \n\n•  mining camps \n\n• \n\nprisons \n\nNote: It is important to ensure that all places holding stocks of PVAs are made aware of the need to \ndestroy superseded forms where the EC revokes an approved PVA and approves a replacement PVA. \n\n2.5  PVAs must be received by 6 pm on the Wednesday prior to polling day to be accepted. \n\n2.6  Section 184AA of the Electoral Act allows political parties and candidates to distribute PVAs with party \n\nmaterial attached.  \n\n3.  General postal voters (GPVs) \n\n3.1  An elector may apply for registration as a General Postal Voter (GPV), which entitles the elector to \n\nhave postal ballot papers for future federal elections automatically sent to them. \n\n3.2  An application for registration as a GPV must be made on one of the grounds specified in the Electoral \n\nAct (s 184A). In general terms, an elector can register to become a general postal voter if they are: \n\n• \n\n• \n\n• \n\n• \n\n• \n\n• \n\n• \n\n• \n\n• \n\n• \n\n• \n\nenrolled at an address more than 20 km away from a polling place \n\na patient at a hospital or nursing home and unable to travel to a polling place \n\nunable to travel due to being infirm at home \n\ncaring for a seriously ill or infirm person \n\nserving a prison sentence of less than 3 years \n\nregistered as a silent elector \n\nunable to attend a polling place due to religious beliefs \n\nunable to sign their name due to a physical incapacity \n\nregistered as an overseas elector \n\na member of the defence force, or a defence civilian serving outside Australia \n\nan Australian Federal Police officer or staff member serving outside Australia. \n\n3.3  There is no requirement that the application be made on an approved form, however the AEC strongly \nprefers to receive applications on forms approved for this purpose. To register as a GPV, electors can \ncomplete the GPV application form, which is available from any AEC office or on the AEC website.  \n\n3.4  An application to be registered as a GPV can be made at any time (s 185 of the Electoral Act). \n\nAccordingly, the process to register a GPV can also be done at any time. As soon as the ballot papers \nfor an election are available, postal voting papers must be sent to GPVs (s 186 of the Electoral Act). \n\n3.5  The EC must keep a register of GPVs for each division. Each register is to be made available for \ninspection by members of the public at the office of the DRO for the division during ordinary office \nhours (s 184B the Electoral Act). The GPV register must be printed from RMANS and further \ninformation can be found in Roll-How. \n\n3.6  The registration of an elector as a GPV may be cancelled by the EC if the ground on which the elector \n\napplied for registration no longer exists (s 185C of the Electoral Act). Although a registration can be \ncancelled at any such time, it is important to recognise that where that cancellation occurs after the \nclose of the roll for an election, the elector remains entitled to a postal vote for that election. For \ninformation on the cancellation of GPV registrations, see Roll-Why. \n\n4       POLICY POSTAL VOTING\n\n\n--- Page 5 ---\n\n3.7  Unlike PVAs for a particular event, the GPV registration process does not involve supplying or \n\nauthentication of a security question/answer before registration may occur.  \n\n3.8  Any GPV applications received between the close of rolls and the deadline for receiving PVAs can be \n\naccepted as a PVA and as a GPV registration. Because of this, the GPV forms cannot be scanned \nand processed as PVAs by the scanning service provider and instead should be copied and \nprocessed as PVAs manually into the AEC’s automated postal vote issuing system (APVIS) by \ndivisions. The elector should also be registered as a GPV for subsequent events – due to ongoing \nstate and local elections the registration should be completed as soon as possible. \n\n4.  Use of PVAs by candidates and political \n\nparties \n\nSupply of paper PVAs \n\n4.1  Where the EC revokes a PVA form and approves a replacement, the Assistant Commissioner, \n\nDelivery and Support Branch is to contact all registered political parties, to advise them of the new \napproved form and the need to destroy superseded forms that may be being held as stock. \n\n4.2  All members, Senators and candidates will be encouraged to promote the Online Postal Vote \n\nApplication (OPVA) with their constituents. This service ensures that the AEC receives the \napplications in a timely manner and can send the postal vote pack out as soon as possible. \n\n4.3 \n\nIf requests for paper PVA forms (and reply envelopes) are received by states and divisions, these \nmust be redirected to the Elector and Roll Services team. This team will then investigate the reasons \nfor the request and if the OPVA is not suitable, will direct them to the pdf version on the AEC website. \nThis includes requests from  \n\n•  Members and Senators \n\n• \n\n• \n\n• \n\n• \n\npolitical parties \n\ncandidates \n\nstate/territory members of parliament \n\npolitical interest groups (unions, lobby groups, peak industry bodies). \n\nReproduction of PVAs \n\n4.4  Subsection 184AA(1) of the Electoral Act allows a postal vote application form to be “physically \n\nattached to, or form part of, other written materials issued by any person or organisation.” This allows \nfor political parties to provide PVAs to constituents alongside election materials.  \n\n4.5  The majority of paper PVA forms received by the AEC for processing during an event are those which \nhave been reproduced by a political party or candidates. It is important that the AEC communicates to \npolitical parties and candidates the importance of reproduced PVAs aligning with legislative \nrequirements to ensure electors are not disenfranchised and the scanning of said forms is as efficient \nas possible.  \n\n4.6 \n\nIt is the State Manager’s role to communicate PVA requirements with political parties in the lead-up to \nelectoral events however Elector and Roll Services will provide information and guidance regarding \nthe key points related to postal voting. The information obtained from political parties these meetings \n(e.g. what their plans are regarding postal voting) should be treated confidentially; at a minimum it \nshould be known by the relevant State Manager, Director Operations, Director of Elector and Roll \nServices Section in NO, and the relevant DRO. \n\n4.7  The AEC provides print-ready artwork of the approved form and guidelines for its reproduction to any \n\nperson or organisation that wishes to reproduce PVAs. Requests to obtain a copy of the approved \n\n5       POLICY POSTAL VOTING\n\n\n--- Page 6 ---\n\nform and guidelines are to be made to the Director, Elector and Roll Services Section in National \nOffice (NO) through the AEC Service Desk. The office lodging this request via the AEC Service Desk \nmust also ensure that the relevant AEO is to be advised of this request. \n\n4.8  When dealing with candidates and political parties it is useful to ascertain relevant information \n\nconcerning their postal vote mail campaigns and provide information to them regarding AEC \nprocesses. Relevant information includes approximate volumes, areas of letterbox drops, and dates \nand intended method of delivery, noting that, if a Service Provider is being used, completed paper \nPVAs must be sent directly to that provider. This exchange of information will assist offices to manage \nthe workload, especially planned peaks in activity, but as this information is confidential (see 4.6) \nsteps must be taken to ensure only the information shared within the AEC network as needed.  \n\n5.  Receipt of PVAs \n\n5.1  Divisional offices (DOs) are not required to stay open to the public until 6pm on the Wednesday three \ndays before polling day to enable receipt of PVAs. However if members of the public come to a \ndivisional office when it is closed to the public, but staff are inside working, staff should attend to the \nperson and assist wherever possible. This may include accepting a paper form for processing. \n\n5.2  The PVA scanning provider must stay open until 6pm (local time) on the Wednesday three days \n\nbefore polling day to enable receipt of PVAs (s 184(5) of the Electoral Act). The scanning provider \nmust clear PO boxes, scan, vet and provide the data from the PVAs that evening to ensure the Postal \nVote Packs (PVP) can be produced and lodged as soon as possible.  \n\n5.3  Divisions must also factor in time to process after this deadline into their staffing plans, noting that \nOPVA and scanned PVA data may not appear in the manual intervention or local print queues until \n6.30pm (local time) due to the background system work. \n\n5.4  PVAs may be made to the EC or, in the case of an application made outside of Australia, also to an \n\nAssistant Returning Officer (ARO) (s 184 of the Electoral Act). \n\n5.5  While every effort should be made to ensure that superseded forms are destroyed, a PVA that is \nmade on a superseded form should be accepted if the application substantially complies with the \napproved form, that is, if the application contains all the information that is required by the Electoral \nAct and is received before 6pm on the Wednesday three days before polling day. \n\n• \n\nFor example, a form stating it must be received by 6pm Thursday two days before polling day \n(forms used at 2013 election stated this) may be accepted, but only if it satisfies the essential \ncriteria set out below. \n\n5.6  The following criteria are essential for a PVA to be considered valid: \n\n• \n\nthe application must include a declaration of entitlement to apply for a postal vote (s 184(1) of the \nElectoral Act) \n\n− \n\n− \n\npaper applications – the declaration of entitlement is the signature \n\nonline applications – the declaration of entitlement is the submission of the form \n\n• \n\n• \n\n• \n\nthe application must be dated (note – the date is automatically generated if a PVA is submitted \nonline) \n\nthe date must not be before the announcement of or issue of writ for an election or referendum \n(an incorrect date in the future however is acceptable provided the PVA is received on time) \n\nthe application must be received by 6pm on the Wednesday three days before polling day \n(s 184(5) of the Electoral Act) (refer to clause 6.10 in this policy). \n\nPVAs not meeting these criteria must be rejected and a defective PVA letter sent to the \napplicant. \n\n5.7  The following criteria are not essential for a PVA to be considered valid: \n\n6       POLICY POSTAL VOTING\n\n\n--- Page 7 ---\n\n• \n\n• \n\n• \n\n• \n\n• \n\n• \n\napplicant’s full name details (e.g. an initial is given instead of a given name) \n\napplicant’s enrolled address details \n\napplicant’s date of birth \n\npostal address \n\ncontact phone number or email address \n\nsecurity question and answer \n\nIf a PVA is missing any or all of these details it must still be accepted. \n\n5.8  The assessment of substantial compliance on non-PVA forms (i.e. letters, form reproductions etc.) \nmust be sent to the Elector and Roll Services team. A decision on these will be done on a case by \ncase basis by the Assistant Commissioner, Elector and Roll Services Section (or delegate) and advice \nprovided to staff directly or via the intranet (if a trend emerges). \n\n5.9 \n\nIf a PVA meets the essential requirements set out above, the postal voting material must be sent to \nthe applicant (s.188(1) of the Electoral Act). \n\n6.  Processing paper PVA forms  \n\n6.1 \n\nInformation from PVA forms will be captured electronically (via a Service Provider with OCR/ICR \ncapability) and/or manually via data entry by AEC staff in RMANS APVIS. \n\n6.2  Timeliness and quality are paramount in either of the above options. If a Service Provider is used: \n\n6.2.1  Arrangements will be made to ensure they receive the paper PVAs as soon as possible. This will \ninclude directions to candidates and parties to directly deliver bulk PVAs to the Service Provider, \nthe Service Provider managing the PO Boxes advertised on the form and AEC website for \nreturned completed forms and the electronic transfer of PVAs from AEC offices to the Service \nProvider. \n\n6.2.2  Strict business and quality rules will be established to ensure correct identification of paper \nPVAs and the correct and efficient capture of data on said forms. These vetting rules will be \npublished before each election and exceptions to these rules will be managed by Elector and \nRoll Services.  \n\n6.2.3  The Service Provider will regularly feed PVA data back to the AEC. This data will be processed \n\nin RMANS APVIS  \n\nNote: A paper PVA form may meet the vetting rules in 6.2.2 but will still need divisional intervention in \nRMANS APVIS if RMANS cannot make the necessary matches to determine entitlement. \n\n6.3  The Service Provider will hold PVA images in an accessible repository for scrutiny and archiving \n\nprocesses. Staff will have access to these images via RMANS APVIS and Declaration Vote Scrutiny \nsub-systems.  \n\n6.4 \n\nIf a Service Provider isn’t being used, PVAs can be manually entered by divisional staff in AEC offices, \nOPCs or in state cells, depending on state management plans.  \n\n6.5  States must ensure that they have sufficient staff (with appropriate systems and RMANS APVIS \n\naccess) and resources to: \n\n6.5.1 \n\nreceive PVAs and transfer them to the Service Provider (as long as the PVA is received by the \nAEC by the deadline); and  \n\n6.5.2  process PVA records received back from the Service Provider in RMANS APVIS efficiently, \n\nincluding after the 6pm deadline. \n\n6.6  Forms processed in AEC offices must be stored securely as they contain personal information.  \n\n7       POLICY POSTAL VOTING\n\n\n--- Page 8 ---\n\nForwarding paper PVAs received in an AEC office to the Service \nProvider \n\n6.7 \n\nIf a Service Provider is being used, staff are reminded that the Service Provider’s processes will result \nin a timelier capture of data, depending on when the forms are sent to them. Therefore, staff must \nsend all paper PVAs to the Service Provider either via electronic transfer or courier. For example:  \n\n• \n\nif a box of forms is dropped off (e.g. by a candidate or party official), then AEC staff must advise \nthat they should be delivered to the Service Providers address. If they refuse to deliver them to \nthe correct address, or they have been left by a courier, then that box of PVAs should be \ncouriered directly to the Service Provider as is (i.e. the box shouldn’t be opened and checked). If \n1-100 forms are received, states and divisions must electronically send them to the Service \nProvider as they are received. \n\no  Forms electronically sent to the Service Provider must be stored securely, but separately to \n\nthose in 6.6 \n\n•  However, if that box is received between 12-6pm on the Wednesday before polling day, the box \n\nshould be opened and the PVAs transferred electronically to the Service Provider. Whilst strict \nvetting is not required in this scenario, the removal of obviously incomplete or non-PVA material \nshould be done. \n\n6.8  GPV forms must be retained in the office and processed directly into RMANS APVIS. \n\nFailure to meet deadline for PVA \n\n6.9 \n\n If a PVA is received after 6pm on the Wednesday three days before polling day, it fails to meet the \ndeadline and the applicant should be advised of that fact and that they will have to vote by other \nmeans (s 184(5), 184(6) of the Electoral Act).  \n\n6.10 \n\nIf the PVA is received by the Service Provider, the AEC may decide to use their services to send a \n“PVA received too late” message (via email or SMS) to the applicant. The Service Provider will also \nscan and transfer the data contained on the PVA to the AEC.  \n\n6.11 \n\nIf the paper PVA is received by an AEC office then AEC staff should attempt to contact the elector and \nprocess the PVA in RMANS APVIS as too late. \n\n6.12 \n\nIf a large number of forms are received by AEC offices after the deadline but before polling day (i.e. \nfrom a candidate or party) these should be sent to the Service Provider (if being used) as they will be \nable to scan and notify applicants more efficiently than divisional staff. \n\n7. \n\nIssuing postal votes \n\n7.1 \n\nIf the EC or an ARO receives a PVA that meets one of the specified grounds, the EC or ARO must \nsend a Postal Voting Certificate (PVC) and the postal voting papers to the applicant.  \n\n7.2  Postal voting material (including the PVC) may be generated and issued centrally (via a Service \n\nProvider), locally or by a ‘hybrid’ method, where for certain postcodes the system will use local printing \nfrom a particular location regardless of where the PVA was processed. RMANS APVIS will be used to \ndetermine the method that ensures the best possible delivery timeframe.  \n\n7.3  PVCs with House of Representatives ballot paper stock attached to them are considered ballot \n\npapers. The handling, storing and transporting of PVCs must comply with requirements of the Ballot \nPaper Handling Policy, prior to, during dispatching and upon return to the division. Preparation and \nissuing of PVCs must be done in a ballot paper secure working zone whether being dispatched by a \nService Provider or AEC office. \n\n7.4 \n\nIt is expected that RMANS APVIS would be used to issue all PVCs, however in circumstances where \nthe system is not available (e.g. due to a network or power failure) it may be necessary to issue PVCs \nmanually (see Producing Postal Vote Certificates SOP).  \n\n8       POLICY POSTAL VOTING\n\n\n--- Page 9 ---\n\n8.  Delivery of postal votes \n\n8.1  The AEC endeavours to deliver postal votes in sufficient time for the elector to vote before 6pm on \npolling day. Postal vote material must be sent by post or other means, not being electronic means \nsuch as fax or email.  \n\n8.2  Postal votes are normally delivered to the applicant by Australia Post priority service, however for all \n\nPVAs received before 6pm on the Wednesday three days before polling day, the postal voting material \nmust be sent to the applicant by a means considered to be the most reasonable and practicable in the \ncircumstances (s 188(2) of the Electoral Act). \n\n8.3  Therefore all divisions must develop a postal vote delivery plan that does not depend on Australia Post \nfactors in the time taken to print locally and collate the PVC packs. This will require divisions to \ninvestigate the alternative non-Australia Post delivery options available in their divisions for sending \npostal voting material where the postcode is hybrid in RMANS APVIS or local knowledge indicates \nthat delivery by means other than Australia Post needs to be considered. \n\n8.4  Where the use of standard, priority or express postal services or standard courier services is likely to \nlead to disenfranchisement, other services can be used as long as delivery of the voting material can \nbe achieved within the necessary timeframes and does not exceed a cost of $100 per elector \nserviced. \n\n• \n\nFor example: delivering postal votes to a remote township of 20 electors at a cost of $1,500 \nwould be acceptable since the cost is $75 per elector.  \n\n8.5  Reasonable and practicable means of delivery includes: \n\n• \n\n• \n\ncommercially available couriers \n\nvehicle or taxi use by an AEC staff member. \n\n8.6  Reasonable and practicable means does not extend to providing a PVC to a third party authorised by \n\nthe applicant. \n\n8.7  The EC (or delegate) may decide that Australia Post is still a reasonable and practicable means of \ndelivery. This would apply in circumstances where a postcode receives regular mail services.  \n\n8.8  A means of sending postal voting material will not be a reasonable and practicable means of delivery if \nit cannot be expected that the applicant would receive that material in sufficient time to vote before \nclose of polling (s 194 of the Electoral Act). \n\n8.9  DROs must receive approval (including Rule 18 financial approval) from state office if they use a \n\nmeans of delivery other than those described above. Any service which exceeds the cost per elector \nthreshold is to be treated as a policy exception. \n\n9.  Silent electors \n\n9.1  Most silent electors are registered as GPVs, and receive postal voting material automatically through \n\ncentral production, however some may choose to apply for postal votes.  \n\n9.2  Silent electors are able to apply using the online PVA system, however it is recommended they use \n\nalternative forms of voting to ensure maximum confidentiality of their information. \n\n9.3 \n\nIf a silent elector chooses to lodge a PVA online or their paper PVA is sent to the scanning centre, \ntheir classified information will be suppressed in RMANS APVIS once they are matched as a silent \nelector. \n\n9.4 \n\nIf a silent elector’s Postal Vote Pack (PVP) can be printed and lodged via central print, then the \nrelevant data will be sent as part of the daily postal voting data file to the Service Provider. \n\n9       POLICY POSTAL VOTING\n\n\n--- Page 10 ---\n\n9.5 \n\n9.6 \n\nIf a local or hybrid print PVP is required, then only an AEC employee that has permission from the \nAEC to deal with silent electors can manually prepare postal voting materials for silent electors.  \n\nIf the elector has included their enrolled address on a PVA (that is stored in a divisional office) it must \nbe masked or obliterated by using a black marker pen. \n\n10.  Replacement of spoilt, missing, lost or \n\ndestroyed postal ballot papers  \n\n10.1  A postal voter who spoils a postal ballot paper may obtain another postal ballot paper by returning the \nspoilt ballot paper to any AEC office. A replacement postal ballot paper may then be posted or issued \npersonally to the voter at any time up to the close of the poll. However, the postal voting material must \nnot be sent by post (or any other means) if it cannot be expected that the applicant would receive that \nmaterial in sufficient time to vote before close of polling (s 194 of the Electoral Act). \n\n10.1.1  If a person cannot physically attend the office to return their spoilt ballot paper, and they claim \n\nthat they cannot make their intended preference clear, advice should be sought from Elector and \nRoll Services on how to proceed (via the AEC Service Desk) \n\n10.2 \n\nIf an elector claims that their ballot paper (or PVC) has been lost, destroyed beyond salvage, or was \nnever received, a new PVC may be issued by reprocessing the PVA, provided the elector has \nprovided written confirmation attesting to this. \n\n11.  Postal ballot papers returned undelivered \n\n11.1  Any postal voting material returned undelivered prior to polling day should be dealt with immediately. \nEvery effort should be made to re-direct the postal voting materials and document steps taken, if any \nare possible, to achieve this (see Postal Voting SOP). \n\n12.  Receipting postal vote certificates \n\n12.1  PVCs are to be receipted on their arrival at AEC premises. This may be conducted at the divisional \noffice, state processing cell, or once transferred to the divisional out-posted centre. The process for \nreceipting PVCs is covered in the Receiving Postal Votes SOP. Note that PVCs are ballot papers and \nare to be handled in accordance with the Ballot Paper Handling Policy. \n\n12.2  PVCs must be receipted up to and after the 13 day post polling receipt period. This information flows \ninto ELMS allowing for accurate estimates for declaration exchange, postal scrutinies and the virtual \ntally room advising parties, candidates and the general public as to how many votes are left to count \nand how many were too late. The Elector and Roll Services team will advise when the RMANS Dec \nVote Scrutiny system is locked and when receipting PVCs can cease. All PVCs received after the \ncutoff must remain securely stored until otherwise advised. \n\n10       POLICY POSTAL VOTING\n\n\n--- Page 11 ---\n\nGlossary for postal voting \n\nAutomated Postal Vote Issuing System (RMANS APVIS): is an election sub-system of the Roll \nManagement System (RMANS EP) used for the registration of PVA details to issue PVCs or defective \nletters. APVIS also captures the date of lodgement with Australia Post and when the PVC is returned to the \nAEC. \n\nBallot paper secure work zone: designated and segregated area, clearly marked via use of bollards, \ndividers or tape, for the interim placement of ballot papers while they are in use and it is not practicable to \nundertake the work in a storage zone (see Ballot Paper Handling Policy). \n\nComputershare (CCS): AEC’s PVA scanning and PVP mail house services contractor who will receive, \nscan and vet all postal vote applications and prepare and lodge PVPs. \n\nGeneral Postal Voter (GPV): an elector who is registered to have postal ballot papers sent to them \nautomatically. Electors from certain categories who have difficulty getting to a polling place on polling day \ncan register as a GPV. \n\nOptical Character Recognition / Intelligent Character Recognition (OCR/ICR): OCR/ICR technologies \ntranslate scanned images into data that can be used in database systems and verified against other data. \n\nOnline Postal Vote Application (OPVA): an electronic form that allows an applicant to securely submit a \nPVA to the AEC using any web-enabled device in Australia or overseas. \n\nPostal voter: a voter who satisfies one of the grounds of application for postal vote set out in Schedule 2 of \nthe Electoral Act and who may apply in writing for a postal vote using a PVA form. Upon receipt of a PVA, \npostal voting material will be dispatched for completion and return prior to the close of poll. \n\nPostal Vote Application (PVA): an application for a postal vote which must be in writing on the form \napproved by the Electoral Commissioner which includes a declaration by the applicant that they are entitled \nto apply for a postal vote.
