  "prompt": "With a highly critical view, provide a scathing, single-paragraph summary in markdown format of the following FOI request overview:\n\nSummary:\n\nThe provided FOI response is a cynical masterclass in official obfuscation and a damning indictment of the government's commitment to transparency. Despite an explicit request for documents related to donations by Zi Chun Wang, the response delivers absolutely no substantive information.\n\nThe most egregious failure is the **complete absence of the requested documents**. The \"Schedule of Released Documents\" tauntingly lists three specific PDF files, complete with file names (`[20141022 Obligations letter.pdf]`, etc.), yet none of these crucial letters are actually provided. This is not mere incompetence; it is a calculated act of non-compliance, effectively nullifying the very purpose of the Freedom of Information Act. The government provides a \"schedule\" of what *should* have been released, creating a veneer of bureaucratic diligence while actively withholding all relevant information. This strongly suggests a deliberate effort to keep the details of Zi Chun Wang's donations and the AEC's actions secret.\n\nFurther exposing this lack of transparency is the repeated inclusion of **extensive redaction codes** across multiple blank or near-blank pages. The sheer breadth of these codes—ranging from \"personal information\" to \"business information,\" \"internal operations,\" \"legal professional communication,\" \"deliberative material,\" and even \"lawful methods or procedures for preventing, detecting, investigating, or dealing with matters arising out of, breaches or evasions of the law\"—reveals an agency prepared to hide almost anything under a labyrinthine bureaucratic shield. The presence of these codes, without any actual content to redact, serves as a stark warning: even if documents *were* released, they would likely be so heavily censored as to be meaningless, protecting the government from any meaningful scrutiny of potential corruption, incompetence, or malfeasance. \"Deliberative material\" (Code 18) and \"Proper and efficient conduct of the operations of AEC material\" (Code 22) are particularly convenient clauses to conceal internal decision-making, failures, or cover-ups.\n\nThe \"Schedule of Released Documents\" itself, while devoid of content, hints at potential failures and delays. The initial \"obligation\" letter was sent in late October 2014, *after* the financial year ending June 2014, suggesting a reactive rather than proactive approach to donor compliance. The subsequent \"reminder\" letter in mid-November strongly implies that Zi Chun Wang was non-compliant, requiring a further nudge from the AEC. This raises serious questions about the effectiveness of the AEC's oversight and the willingness of significant donors to comply with regulations.\n\nIn conclusion, this FOI response is not a release of information, but a meticulously constructed barrier to it. It demonstrates a government apparatus more concerned with administrative optics than genuine accountability, systematically failing its duty to provide transparency by withholding all material information while parading a performative adherence to process. The complete absence of content, coupled with the pre-emptive justification for extensive censorship, paints a damning picture of an organization actively frustrating public oversight regarding potentially sensitive political donations.\n\nProvide only the markdown formatted summary text. Do not include any conversational filler or preamble."
