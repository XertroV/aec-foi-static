It clarifies that no single person is behind the AEC Twitter handle; instead, it's managed by the Media and Digital Engagement Section in National Office, supported by a dedicated Social Media Operations Group (SMOG) during elections. This team, utilizing the Falcon management tool, handles monitoring, triaging, and responding to queries, with multiple layers of supervision and escalation involving various digital and media officers, emphasizing a collective, structured approach to managing the AEC's online presence."

  "prompt": "Create a concise, single-paragraph summary in markdown format of the following FOI request summary:\n\nSummary:\n\n### FOI Request Summary: AEC Twitter Policy and Identity\n\nThis summary details the request made under the Freedom of Information (FOI) Act, the documents released in response, and the relevant content pertaining to the FOI request.\n\n#### Main Purpose of the FOI Request\n\nThe FOI request, submitted by James Daniels (LEX1060), sought information regarding the 'AEC Twitter policy and identity of the person behind the AEC Twitter handle'.\n\n#### Documents from the FOI Request\n\nThe document retrieved and released in response to the request is:\n\n*   **Media and Digital Engagement Plan – 2021/2022 federal election**, dated 01/07/2021.\n\n#### Main Content from the Documents (relating to the FOI Request)\n\nThe **Media and Digital Engagement Plan 2021/2022 federal election** outlines the Australian Electoral Commission's (AEC) strategy for media and digital engagement, including its approach to social media platforms like Twitter, and details the structure and procedures for managing these channels.\n\n**AEC Twitter Policy/Approach:**\n\nThe plan integrates social media management as part of the broader AEC Reputation Management Framework, guided by six principles focused on building a positive reputation, open communication, positioning the AEC as an expert, judicious use of language/tone/timing, backing public statements with operational delivery, and active monitoring/risk management.\n\nSpecifically for social media operations (including Twitter), the plan outlines the following engagement approach during the federal election:\n\n*   **Proactive Content:** Regularly provide relevant, informative, and engaging content, anticipating potential criticism.\n*   **Responsiveness:** Be responsive to questions and criticisms, subject to swift review of claims.\n*   **Timeliness:** Ensure timely responses, including the use of holding lines.\n*   **Accuracy:** Rely on facts and concentrate on content accuracy.\n*   **Tone:** Employ a tone that demonstrates real people are responding and are helpful, while maintaining professionalism. Selectively use a firm tone to debunk procedural myths.\n*   **Visuals:** Use visual accompaniments to provide context wherever possible.\n*   **Monitoring:** Actively monitor content both on and outside of AEC channels.\n*   **Approval Workflow:** Reactive content on social media accounts follows the same considerations and processes as the media enquiry handling process, with immediate ramifications for speed of spread being a key decision factor.\n\n**Identity of the Person Behind the AEC Twitter Handle:**\n\nThe document does not identify a single 'person' behind the AEC Twitter handle but rather details a structured team and process responsible for all corporate social media accounts, including Twitter.\n\n*   **Administration:** The administration of all AEC social media accounts is undertaken entirely by the **Media and Digital Engagement Section** in National Office. This centralisation is due to social media's close links to issues management and the need for connection to media monitoring and operational updates.\n*   **Social Media Operations Group (SMOG):** For the election period, a dedicated **Social Media Operations Group (SMOG)** comprising approximately ten labour hire staff is stood up. SMOG staff monitor incoming mentions, triage, respond to basic queries, monitor external traffic (via keyword listening), and escalate content. They work in shifts from 5 am to 10 pm.\n*   **Supervision and Escalation:**\n    *   **Senior SMOG staff** (AEC staff from non-election business areas) provide the first layer of immediate supervision.\n    *   The entire SMOG operation is overseen by the **Digital and Social Media Officer** within the Media and Digital Engagement Section. This officer is responsible for pre-populating social media responses in the management tool (Falcon), setting up monitoring briefs, onboarding and training SMOG staff, and initial escalation of complex/sensitive content.\n    *   The **Digital and Social Media Manager** and **Principal Media Advisor** are the senior points of escalation, leading the management and curation of content for all sensitive matters arising on the channels.\n*   **Tools:** The AEC uses **Falcon** as its social media management and monitoring tool, which supports publishing, engagement, listening, and measurement functionalities. Each member of the Media and Digital Engagement Section, including the SMOG, has an individual Falcon profile with appropriate access levels.\n\nIn essence, the \"identity of the person\" behind the AEC Twitter handle is a collective of roles and teams within the AEC's Media and Digital Engagement Section, operating under a defined policy and escalation framework.\n\nProvide only the markdown formatted summary text. Do not include any conversational filler or preamble."
