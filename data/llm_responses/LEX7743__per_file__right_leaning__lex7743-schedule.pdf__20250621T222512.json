The explicit absence of relevant exemptions ensures that the public can scrutinize how taxpayer money is managed and who benefits from government interactions, thereby fostering economic efficiency by deterring wasteful spending or preferential treatment that could distort free markets. This direct accountability mechanism is vital for preventing governmental opacity and mission creep, reinforcing the national interest by ensuring a limited, accountable state that serves the public rather than operating in secrecy."
