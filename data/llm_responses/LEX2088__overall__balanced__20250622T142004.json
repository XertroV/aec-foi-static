The actual content of the nomination forms themselves is heavily redacted in the provided release.\n\nThe scheduled documents relate to five candidates for the Division of Cook:\n*   **Catherine Elizabeth Dyson:** Nomination Form (AECEF060) and Bulk Nomination (AEC060-a).\n*   **Jacqueline Guinane:** Nomination Form (AECEF060) and Bulk Nomination (AEC060-a).\n*   **Simon Roger Earle:** Bulk Nomination (AEC060-a), noting Document No. 5 is subject to exhaustion of third-party review rights.\n*   **Scott John Morrison:** Nomination Form (AECEF060) and Bulk Nomination (AEC060-a).\n*   **Gaye Cameron:** Facsimile transmission of Nomination Form (AECEF060) and Single Nomination (AEC060-b).\n\n### Main Content from FOI Request Documents\nThe key content provided by this FOI release, beyond the request itself, is:\n*   **Identification of Candidates and Forms:** The schedule confirms the specific candidates (Catherine Elizabeth Dyson, Jacqueline Guinane, Simon Roger Earle, Scott John Morrison, Gaye Cameron) and the types of nomination forms (AECEF060, AEC060-a, AEC060-b) associated with their formal declaration for the 2022 Federal Election in the Division of Cook.\n*   **Redaction Information:** Multiple pages of \"REDACTION CODES\" are included, detailing the specific categories of information that have been withheld from the nomination forms. These categories include:\n    *   **Personal Information:** Name, date/place of birth, citizenship, photograph, signatures, addresses, email/phone numbers, political/religious beliefs, health, employment history, qualifications, and other identifying details.\n    *   **Business Information:** Bank account/billing details, trade secrets, and information that could adversely affect lawful business or prejudice future supply of information.\n    *   **Other Exemptions:** Legal professional communication, deliberative material, electoral roll material, and information related to the proper and efficient conduct of AEC operations or investigations.\n\nIn essence, the FOI request confirms the existence and types of nomination documents for the specified candidates but releases them with significant redactions to protect sensitive personal and business information under the Freedom of Information Act 1982."
