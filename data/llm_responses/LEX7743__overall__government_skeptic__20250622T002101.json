It suggests either a lack of clear pathways for citizens to find readily available government information, or an unnecessary administrative burden on the FOI system. While presented as a positive for transparency, the vague \"Client Details\" title, without context on what specific \"clients\" are being referred to (e.g., voters, donors, contractors), leaves significant room for opacity. This high-level listing of an already public document could be interpreted as performative transparency, potentially diverting attention from genuinely sensitive or non-public information."
