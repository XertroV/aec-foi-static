(VFUD). Each entry provides the document's title, any applied FOI exemption, and the access decision.\n\nThis schedule is directly relevant to the FOI request concerning VFUD's deregistration. It itemises the key records that support and detail the events described in the request overview, including:\n*   The delegate's decision to deregister VFUD and the supporting rationale (Doc 3, 4).\n*   VFUD's submitted membership lists (Doc 16, 18) and the results of their testing (Doc 20, 23).\n*   Crucially, it includes the email instructing the non-random sampling of VFUD's second list (Doc 19), which directly corroborates the \"procedural error\" acknowledged by the AEC Commission.\n*   It also lists documents pertaining to the AEC's established membership testing methodology (Doc 10, 11, 12, Supp 3) and external advice received regarding it (Doc 24, Supp 2), which addresses VFUD's claims of a flawed methodology and the AEC's subsequent review.\n*   The schedule also covers the various applications for internal review submitted by VFUD (Doc 5, 6, 7) and related communications.\n\nIn essence, this document serves as an index to the evidentiary basis for the AEC's deregistration decision and the subsequent internal review, directly aligning with the scope of the FOI request."

Do not include any conversational filler or preamble.To aid you, the overview of the FOI request is: [REQUEST OVERVIEW START] The FOI request concerned the deregistration of the political party VOTEFLUX.ORG | Upgrade Democracy! (VFUD) by the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) for failing to meet the mandatory 1,500-member threshold. This decision stemmed from VFUD's submitted membership lists failing the AEC's statistical testing methodology, which the party contended was fundamentally flawed, particularly after a procedural error saw the delegate non-randomly test only 1,650 names from a larger 4,680-member list. During the subsequent internal review, the AEC Commission affirmed the deregistration, critically acknowledging that the delegate's non-random testing of the second list was a \"departure from the methodology\" and placed \"no weight\" on its results. However, the deregistration was upheld based on the definitive failure of VFUD's *first* membership test and the party's subsequent failure to provide a properly testable list within the AEC's established, resource-constrained methodology.\n [REQUEST OVERVIEW END] \n\n--- MAIN DOCUMENT TEXT START ---\n\n\n\n--- Page 1 ---\n\nAttachment A – Schedule of Relevant Documents \n\nDocument No. \n\nDocument Title \n\nExemption  \n\nDecision on access  \n\n1 \n\n2  \n\n3 \n\n4 \n\n5 \n\n6 \n\nCommission Paper  \n\nAttachments to Commission Paper  \n\nS 47F, s 42  \n\nSee below  \n\nAttachment A Notice of delegate’s decision to deregister VOTEFLUX.ORG | \nUpgrade Democracy! and statement of reasons dated 24 March 2022 \n\nAttachment B Minute to delegate to recommending deregistration under \ns 137(6) of the Electoral Act of the Party VOTEFLUX.ORG | Upgrade \nDemocracy! dated 24 March 2022 \n\nS 47F \n\nAttachment C [Redacted] application for review under s 141(2) of decision \nto deregister VOTEFLUX.ORG | Upgrade Democracy! dated 14 April 2022 \n\nAttachment D [Redacted] application for review under s 141(2) of decision \nto deregister VOTEFLUX.ORG | Upgrade Democracy! dated 26 April 2022 \n\nAttachment E [Redacted] application for review under s 141(2) of decision \nto deregister VOTEFLUX.ORG | Upgrade Democracy dated 6 May 2022 \n\nS 47F \n\nEdited copy \n\nSee below  \n\n Access in full –[LINK] \n\nEdited copy  \n\nAccess in full  \n\nEdited copy   \n\nEdited copy  \n\n10 Mort Street, Canberra ACT 2601  P 02 6271 4411  F 02 6293 7601 \n\nwww.aec.gov.au\n\n\n--- Page 2 ---\n\nDocument No. \n\nDocument Title \n\nExemption  \n\nDecision on access  \n\n7 \n\n8 \n\n9 \n\n10 \n\n11 \n\n12 \n\n13 \n\n14 \n\n15 \n\nAttachment F Email from AEC Party Registration Section confirming that \n[Redacted] name not on the list of party members submitted by \nVOTEFLUX.ORG | Upgrade Democracy! dated 27 June 2022 \n\nAttachment G Email from Commission Secretariat to [Redacted] \nrequesting further information for the application for review dated 4 July \n2022 \n\nAttachment H – [Redacted] \n\nAttachment I – [Redacted] \n\nAttachment J Guide for registering a party by the AEC dated 10 September \n2021 \n\nAttachment K –Commission meeting minutes endorsing current party \nregistration testing membership methodology dated 6 October 2021 \n\nAttachment L –Commission methodology minutes and consideration of \nmethodology dated 20 March 2016 \n\nAttachment M Extract of ABS sample size calculator set to risk rejection at \n6% for rejecting a valid list \n\nS 47F \n\nS 47F \n\nS 42  \n\nS 42  \n\nS 47F \n\nS 47F \n\nAttachment N Letter from delegate to VoteFlux.Org | Upgrade Democracy \nrequesting a list of 1500-1650 members dated 8 October 2021 \n\nS 47F \n\nEdited copy  \n\nEdited copy  \n\nExempt in full \n\nExempt in full  \n\nRelease in full – [LINK] \n\nEdited copy  \n\nRelease in full – [LINK]  \n\nRelease in Full  \n\nEdited copy  \n\n10 Mort Street, Canberra ACT 2601  P 02 6271 4411  F 02 6293 7601 \n\nwww.aec.gov.au\n\n\n--- Page 3 ---\n\nDocument No. \n\nDocument Title \n\nExemption  \n\nDecision on access  \n\n16 \n\n17 \n\n18 \n\n19 \n\n20 \n\n21 \n\n22 \n\nAttachment O VOTEFLUX.ORG | Upgrade Democracy! submitted \nmembership list of 1649 members to the delegate of the Commission \ndated 7 December 2022 \n\nAttachment P Letter from delegate to VOTEFLUX.ORG | Upgrade \nDemocracy! enclosing s138A notice of intention to deregister 13 January \n2022 \n\nAttachment Q Statement from VOTEFLUX.ORG | Upgrade Democracy! \nenclosing list of 4,680 members dated 13 February 2022 \n\nS 47F \n\nS 47F \n\nS 47F \n\nAttachment R Email from delegate of the Commission instructing to take \ntop 1,650 names from list provided by the party, dated 2 March 2022 \n\nS 47F, s 42 \n\nAttachment S Results of membership testing of second list submitted by \nVOTEFLUX.ORG | Upgrade Democracy!
