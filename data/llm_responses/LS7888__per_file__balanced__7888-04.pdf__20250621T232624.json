            "text": "## Document Summary\n\nThis document, comprising internal Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) email exchanges from March to June 2018, details analyses related to Indigenous electoral enrolment. It presents an age breakdown of the **107,607 Indigenous individuals identified solely through Centrelink data** who are not on the electoral roll, noting that a significant portion (30.7% or 33,008 individuals) are aged 18-24. Discussions indicate ongoing internal work to refine this data by cross-referencing with deceased persons' files and deleted records to verify eligibility. The correspondence also explores the effectiveness of outreach methods, specifically the correlation between Email/SMS communications and new enrolments, particularly for the 18-39 age group. Concerns are highlighted regarding lower Email/SMS provision and subsequent enrolment response rates in the Northern Territory, Western Australia, and South Australia, prompting further investigation into potential disengagement in these states.\n\n## Relevance to FOI Request LS7888\n\nThis document is highly relevant to FOI request LS7888, which sought information on the AEC's new methodology for its Indigenous Electoral Participation Program (IEPP), particularly its design, testing, and implementation.\n\n*   **Design & Testing of New Methodology:** The document provides direct evidence of the application of the new core methodology – the \"direct matching of electoral roll data with Centrelink Indigeneity data\" – by explicitly referencing the 107,607 unenrolled Indigenous individuals identified through this process. It illustrates the \"testing\" phase through detailed internal data analysis, including age demographics and cross-referencing with other datasets (deceased persons, deleted records) to refine the accuracy and eligibility of the identified cohort. The suggestion of needing \"additional/special\" work with BDM data for eligibility further highlights the design and testing phases.\n*   **Implementation & Tracking:** The analysis of Email/SMS communication effectiveness and regional disparities in enrolment response rates (NT, WA, SA) directly relates to the \"implementation\" strategies for enrolment stimulation and the \"tracking\" of outcomes. This demonstrates how the AEC was monitoring the performance of its outreach efforts stemming from the new methodology.\n*   **Catalysts & Outcomes:** The insights gained from the data analysis, such as identified lower engagement in specific states, serve as \"catalysts\" for refining and improving future outreach initiatives to enhance \"outcomes\" in Indigenous enrolment rates.\n*   **Confirmation of Key Figures:** The document specifically details the age breakdown of the \"107,607 unenrolled Indigenous individuals\" identified, directly corroborating a key outcome highlighted in the FOI overview regarding the new methodology's success in identifying potential enrollees.\n*   **Limitations:** Consistent with the FOI overview, this document provides limited information on Indigenous involvement in the design process or specific project costs and staffing."

  "prompt": "Considering this document as part of an FOI request, summarize the document and its relevance to the FOI request in markdown format. FYI the overview of the FOI request is: FOI request LS7888 sought documents (2018-2019) on the Australian Electoral Commission's (AEC) new methodology for its Indigenous Electoral Participation Program (IEPP), specifically its design, testing, and implementation, including catalysts, tracking, outcomes, Indigenous involvement, and cost/staff. The released documents, primarily emails and internal papers, reveal that the core of the new methodology is the direct matching of electoral roll data with Centrelink Indigeneity data, a more robust approach initiated internally to improve accuracy, replacing less reliable prior regression models. This method helped identify over 107,000 unenrolled Indigenous individuals, contributing to enrolment stimulation events (e.g., 2,646 new enrolments). The documents confirm estimated national Indigenous enrolment rates of 76.4% (June 2018) and 76.6% (June 2019), demonstrating a significant upward trend from previous estimates, though they provide limited information on Indigenous involvement in the design process or the final cost and exact staffing for the project.\n\nDocument Text:\n\nFrom: Angelo Rojas <Angelo.Rojas@aec.gov.au>  \nSent: Monday, 4 June 2018 3:45 PM \nTo: Guy Lewis <Guy.Lewis@aec.gov.au> \nCc: Stephanie Maxwell <Stephanie.Maxwell@aec.gov.au> \nSubject: FW: Indigenous data [SEC=UNCLASSIFIED] \n\nGuy - as discussed, the number of new enrolments for Indigenous not on the roll could be predicted to a fair extent by the proportion of Email/SMSs \nprovided by State. Further analysis of this shows that the strong correlation is for people aged 18-39. \n\nThe proportion of people aged 18-39 in NT, WA and SA who provided Email/SMS is low and so is their proportion of new enrolments. This analysis will be \nmore direct when Mike provides me with the extract that includes Email and/or SMS sent to confirm two hypothesis: \n\n1. We are sending less Email/SMS to these states.\n2. Additionally, enrolment response rates are also lower for these states than for the rest (higher level of disengagement).\n\nLS7888 Released Document No. 4Released under the Freedom of Information Act 1982\fReleased under the Freedom of Information Act 1982\fReleased under the Freedom of Information Act 1982\f60-69 \n70+ \n\n1.4% \n0.0% \n100.0% \n\n1.2% \n0.2% \n100.0% \n\n1.8% \n0.4% \n100.0% \n\n1.0% \n0.2% \n100.0% \n\n3.6% \n0.2% \n100.0% \n\n0.8% \n0.0% \n100.0% \n\n1.0% \n0.0% \n100.0% \n\n1.9% \n0.4% \n100.0% \n\n1.4% \n0.2% \n100.0% \n\nTotal % \n\nAngelo Rojas | Senior Project Officer  \nRoll Program & Community Engagement Section | Roll Management & Community Engagement Branch \n\nLS7888 Released Document No. 4Released under the Freedom of Information Act 1982 \n \n \n\fAustralian Electoral Commission \nT: (02) 6271 4507 X: 21336 M: \n\nFrom: Warrick Poyser  \nSent: Thursday, 8 March 2018 5:12 PM \nTo: Guy Lewis <Guy.Lewis@aec.gov.au> \nCc: Delyse Paliaga <Delyse.Paliaga@aec.gov.au>; Gina Dario <Gina.Dario@aec.gov.au>; Stephanie Maxwell \n<Stephanie.Maxwell@aec.gov.au>; Angelo Rojas <Angelo.Rojas@aec.gov.au>; Michael Roden <Michael.Roden@aec.gov.au> \nSubject: RE: Indigenous data [SEC=UNCLASSIFIED] \n\nThanks Guy – this data is very interesting. \nI suspect we may have to do something additional/special with the BDM data to establish eligibility prior to being able to do any meaningful \ndirect enrolment effort. \n\nWarrick Poyser  \nSystems Delivery & Modernisation Section | Operations Branch \nAustralian Electoral Commission \nT: (02) 6271 4452 X: 21319 M: \n\nFrom: Guy Lewis  \nSent: Thursday, 8 March 2018 3:38 PM \nTo: Warrick Poyser <Warrick.Poyser@aec.gov.au> \nCc: Delyse Paliaga <Delyse.Paliaga@aec.gov.au>; Gina Dario <Gina.Dario@aec.gov.au>; Stephanie Maxwell \n\nLS7888 Released Document No. 4777Released under the Freedom of Information Act 1982  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n\f<Stephanie.Maxwell@aec.gov.au>; Angelo Rojas <Angelo.Rojas@aec.gov.au>; Michael Roden <Michael.Roden@aec.gov.au> \nSubject: Indigenous data [SEC=UNCLASSIFIED] \n\nWarrick, the age breakdown of the 107,607 Indigenous people that are only on the Centrelink file is. \n\nYear of Birth \n1900 – 1920 \n1924 – 1930 \n1931 – 1940 \n1941 – 1950 \n1951 – 1960 \n1961 – 1970 \n1971 – 1980 \n1981 – 1990 \n1991 – 2000 \n2001 \n\nNumber \n23  \n239  \n944  \n2,667  \n6,201  \n12,345  \n16,216  \n23,863  \n41,597  \n3,512  \n\nTotal   107,607  \n\n% \n0.02% \n0.2% \n0.9% \n2.5% \n5.8% \n11.5% \n15.1% \n22.2% \n38.7% \n3.3% \n100% \n\nYouth Group (18 to 24)  \n\n33,008  \n\n30.7% \n\nMike is also rerunning the data against the deceased persons file and deleted records to remove those who are deceased and identify those who have been \nenrolled in the past.
