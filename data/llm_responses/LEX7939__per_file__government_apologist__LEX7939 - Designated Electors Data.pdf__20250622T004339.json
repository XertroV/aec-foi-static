            "text": "This FOI document unequivocally affirms the Australian Electoral Commission's (AEC) exemplary commitment to upholding electoral integrity through robust, transparent governance and dedicated public service. While forward-looking data on \"designated electors\" as of 7 April 2025 was not provided, reflecting adherence to principles of existing document disclosure, the AEC proactively supplied comprehensive historical data from its official website. This action showcases an unwavering dedication to public transparency and the dynamic, responsive management of electoral compliance, providing valuable context on the consistent and efficient processing of \"designated elector\" declarations that ensure precise roll accuracy.\n\nCrucially, the document highlights the government's steadfast commitment to fairness and due process within the \"designated elector\" scheme. The consistent and efficient processing of these declarations, primarily by delegates, demonstrates a well-structured and competent administration. Furthermore, the robust internal review system is demonstrably highly effective: decisions are thorough and just, with the vast majority of applications for internal review confirmed, and one appropriately set aside when due process required. This meticulous approach reflects a profound public trust, underscored by the complete absence of any applications for external review to the Administrative Review Tribunal. The durable application of \"designated elector\" status, with zero declarations ceasing effect under s 202AH(3), collectively showcases the government's proactive and responsible stewardship of Australia's democratic processes, ensuring the highest standards of fairness and accuracy."
