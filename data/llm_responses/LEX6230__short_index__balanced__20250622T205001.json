The core content details BMF's requests for formal approval of initial campaign cost estimates (including retainer, digital, and social media services, with TVC costs pending), discussions on financial administration and payment terms, and extensive queries regarding media recommendations, specific asset requirements (e.g., TVC length, social formats, OOH variations), and production considerations, alongside efforts to establish regular Work In Progress meetings."

  "prompt": "Create a concise, single-paragraph summary in markdown format of the following FOI request summary:\n\nSummary:\n\n## FOI Request Summary\n\nThis FOI request pertains to the planning, cost estimates, and financial communications related to an advertising or public information campaign.\n\n### Documents from the FOI Request\n\nThe released documents consist primarily of email communications and their associated attachments, dating from May to July 2024. These documents are detailed in an accompanying schedule. Many of the documents have been either refused in full or released in part, with exemptions applied under sections such as S47(1)(b) (personal information or commercial-in-confidence), S47F (business affairs/commercial-in-confidence), S22 (irrelevant information or redactions), and S47E (deliberative processes).\n\n### Main Content from the FOI Request Documents\n\nThe core content of the released emails reveals discussions between an advertising agency (BMF) and the government body, focusing on:\n\n*   **Formalization of Cost Estimates:**\n    *   BMF sought formal approval for initial cost estimates for an \"un-dated phase\" of the campaign.\n    *   These initial estimates included retainer fees for account management, planning, and creative services, as well as costs for digital display, content & social media, and Adbank services.\n    *   Costs for Television Commercial (TVC) production were explicitly noted as pending formalization until the authorization message for the TVC was confirmed.\n*   **Financial Administration and Payment Terms:**\n    *   Communications address practical financial matters, such as confirming the appropriate recipient for invoices due to staff changes within the government body.\n    *   Discussions included the confirmation of suggested payment terms for various project quotes, with an emphasis on aligning with existing contract terms, particularly with the End of Financial Year (EOFY) in mind.\n    *   An \"updated finance tracker\" was referenced and attached, while a previously shared Out-Of-Home (OOH) & Print price quote was retracted as not yet formalized.\n*   **Campaign Planning and Media Queries:**\n    *   Detailed queries were raised by BMF regarding media recommendations and asset requirements for the campaign. These queries highlight specific production considerations and strategic decisions, including:\n        *   Whether a media buy would occur for the \"Brand phase\" and the feasibility of fitting the current script into a 30-second TVC (suggesting alternative formats like 30-second awareness or 2x15-second completion videos).\n        *   Questions about production costs for new TVC edits.\n        *   Recommendations for retaining 60-second formats for cinema advertising.\n        *   Requests for clarity on integrated partnerships and the need to account for new asset creation if required.\n        *   Specific questions about social media formats, including horizontal META formats for platforms like WeChat and Weibo, the strategic rationale behind using only 15-second social video assets versus 6-second or 10-second formats, and whether static social assets would be provided.\n        *   Inquiries about the need for two versions of Formality OOH (with and without QR codes).\n        *   Confirmation on whether UM (likely a media agency) would produce live read pointers and handicapped radio assets.\n    *   The documents mention \"ballot papers\" and reference activities from \"last election,\" indicating the campaign is likely related to public awareness or an electoral event.\n*   **Meeting and Communication Protocols:**\n    *   The emails also show an effort to establish regular communication, including proposals for weekly Work In Progress (WIP) meetings to discuss campaign progress and address queries.\n\nProvide only the markdown formatted summary text. Do not include any conversational filler or preamble."
