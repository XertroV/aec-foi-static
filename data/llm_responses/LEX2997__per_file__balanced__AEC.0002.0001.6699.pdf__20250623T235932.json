It also notes the attachment of the \"Weekly Report for week ending 21 May 2021\".\n\n### Relevance to FOI Request\n\nThis document demonstrates the Australian Electoral Commission's (AEC) routine internal administrative processes for collecting and collating weekly operational information and issues. While it doesn't contain specific details about the Andrew Laming MP investigation, it indicates the existence of an internal \"Weekly Issues Report\" where ongoing investigations or significant matters, such as the Laming inquiry, might be tracked or summarized internally within the AEC. The email itself serves as a logistical reminder for reporting, rather than disclosing substantive information about the investigation itself."

Do not include any conversational filler or preamble.To aid you, the overview of the FOI request is: [REQUEST OVERVIEW START] The FOI request disclosed documents detailing the Australian Electoral Commission's (AEC) investigation into Andrew Laming MP's Facebook pages for compliance with federal electoral authorisation laws. This inquiry was triggered by public complaints and media reports, notably from *The Guardian*, alleging Laming used numerous pages (e.g., \"Redland Bay Bulletin,\" \"Redlands Institute\") disguised as community or news groups to promote political content and attack opponents without mandatory disclosures. The AEC confirmed an active investigation, noting 2018 Electoral Act amendments broadened social media authorisation, and issued formal notices to Laming for detailed information and to third parties (like Facebook) for data, with Facebook confirming its cooperation. Findings revealed some pages were removed or updated with authorisation, while others remained active and unauthorised.\n [REQUEST OVERVIEW END] \n\n--- MAIN DOCUMENT TEXT START ---\n\n\n\n--- Page 1 ---\n\nAEC.0002.0001.6699\n\nFrom:                                 ELT SupportSent:                                  Thu, 27 May 2021 08:34:18 +1000To:                                      ELT Support;ELT Weekly ReportingSubject:                             FOR ACTION: ELT Weekly Reporting - DUE COB TODAY [SEC=OFFICIAL]Attachments:                   03.
