            "text": "This document, titled \"Analysis of Indigenous Enrolment,\" details the Australian Electoral Commission's (AEC) updated methodology for estimating Indigenous electoral enrolment rates.\n\n**Summary of Document:**\nThe document outlines the AEC's shift from an indirect, statistically-based regression model (used in 2014, yielding \"alarmingly low\" rates) to a more direct estimation method. This new approach, implemented since 2017, leverages Centrelink client files that include a self-identified Indigenous indicator. By matching these Centrelink records to the electoral roll, the AEC can more accurately estimate Indigenous enrolment rates.\n\nKey findings and details presented:\n*   **New Methodology:** The AEC's \"current method\" involves person-level matching between the electoral roll and Centrelink data, including Centrelink's Indigenous indicator. An adjustment factor is applied to raw Centrelink-based enrolment rates to align them with overall AEC enrolment rates.\n*   **Estimated Enrolment Rates:** As of 30 June 2018, the estimated national Indigenous enrolment rate using this new methodology was **76.4%**. State-level breakdowns are also provided.\n*   **Enrolment Stimulation:** Through data cleansing and analysis of the Centrelink file, the AEC identified **72,451 potentially unenrolled Indigenous Australians** (under 65) as of mid-2018.\n*   **Outcomes of Stimulation:** An enrolment stimulation event conducted in February/March 2019, using the 2018 Centrelink data, resulted in the enrolment of **2,646 individuals** who indicated they were Indigenous. This reduced the identified unenrolled cohort to 69,143.\n*   **Data Limitations:** The document acknowledges that Centrelink data represents only about half of the total electoral roll and is limited to Indigenous Australians receiving Centrelink benefits who have self-identified. It also notes issues with matching data for Indigenous Australians aged 65 and over.\n*   **Detailed Breakdown:** Tables provide granular data on enrolled and potentially unenrolled Indigenous Australians by state and electoral division.\n\n**Relevance to FOI Request LS7888:**\nThis document is highly relevant to FOI request LS7888 as it directly addresses:\n*   **New Methodology:** It provides comprehensive details on the AEC's new methodology for its Indigenous Electoral Participation Program (IEPP), specifically its reliance on Centrelink's self-identified Indigenous data.\n*   **Planning and Implementation:** It describes the transition from the old method, the integration of Centrelink data into the Annual Roll Integrity Review (ARIR), and the execution of the enrolment stimulation event.\n*   **Outcomes:** It presents key outcomes such as the increased estimated Indigenous enrolment rate (76.4% by June 2018), the identification of potentially unenrolled Indigenous Australians, and the number of new enrolments resulting from the stimulation event.\n\nConsistent with the FOI overview, the document does not explicitly detail the number of Indigenous people involved in the methodology's development or its final costs and dedicated AEC staffing. However, it significantly clarifies the technical planning, implementation, and initial outcomes of the new IEPP methodology."

  "prompt": "Considering this document as part of an FOI request, summarize the document and its relevance to the FOI request in markdown format. FYI the overview of the FOI request is: FOI request LS7888 sought documents from 2018-2019 concerning the Australian Electoral Commission's (AEC) new methodology for its Indigenous Electoral Participation Program (IEPP), specifically regarding its planning, implementation, outcomes, Indigenous involvement, and costs. The released documents reveal the AEC transitioned to a more direct method for estimating Indigenous electoral enrolment rates, primarily by utilising self-identified Indigeneity data from Centrelink. This shift, driven by the availability of new Centrelink data, significantly increased estimated Indigenous enrolment rates from approximately 58% (under the old 2014 methodology) to 76.4% by June 2018 and 76.6% by June 2019. The documents detail the new methodology, its impact, and efforts to track enrolment stimulation, including identifying over 72,000 potentially unenrolled Indigenous Australians in mid-2018 and subsequent enrolment events. However, the released content did not explicitly detail the number of Indigenous people involved in the methodology's development or its final costs and dedicated AEC staffing.\n\nDocument Text:\n\n\n\n--- Page 1 ---\n\nAnalysis of Indigenous Enrolment \n\nPopulation estimates \n\nTable 1 represents the ABS estimated resident Indigenous population 18 years and over by state \nas at 2016 and projected to 30 June 2019. \n\nThe projected population for Indigenous Australians has been recently updated and adjusted by \nthe ABS.

No. 3238.0) \n\n(a) Projection Series B has been used for the period 2017-2019.\n\n(b) An age heaping adjustment was applied to derive final 30 June 2016 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander\npopulation estimates for the Northern Territory. This information was published in Estimates of Aboriginal\nand Torres Strait Islander Australians, June 2016 (cat. no. 3238.0.55.001) and has been used as the base\npopulation for compiling estimates and projections for this release.\n\n(c) Includes Other Territories.\n\nIndigenous enrolment rate estimates \n\nAs Australia’s federal electoral roll does not have a personal Indigenous identifier, estimating the \nenrolment rates for Indigenous persons is problematic, however, having this key franchise KPI for \nthe Indigenous population is important for Closing the Gap purposes and the AECs focus on how \nthe franchise could be better delivered. \n\nIn 2014 the AEC’s Research Section commenced indirect estimation of these figures, using a \nregression model of the relationship between the Indigenous population and each of the three \nfranchise KPIs at a small area level, such as polling place catchment or the ABS’ SA2 geography. \n\nLS7888 Released Document No. 29Released under the Freedom of Information Act 1982\n\n\n--- Page 2 ---\n\nWhile the models did not fit the data particularly well, the resulting Indigenous enrolment rates \nwere statistically based on real data, rather than anecdote. Yet the resulting enrolment and turnout \nrates in particular were alarmingly low, and hopefully represented a worst case picture. \n\nCurrent method \n\nThe Centrelink client file with Indigenous indicator available to the AEC annually since 2017 has \npresented an excellent opportunity, via matching to the Roll and mark-off data, to improve \nestimation of Indigenous franchise KPIs.  \n\nWhile the results are subject to a number of non-trivial assumptions, the more direct estimation \nmethods lead to a higher likelihood of robust results. The figures should nevertheless still be \nregarded as indicative only. \n\nAs part of the Annual Roll Integrity Review (ARIR), the person-level matching between the Roll and \nCentrelink now includes Centrelink’s Indigenous indicator. However, as Centrelink customers \nrepresent only around half of the Roll, the matching (even if perfect) would be far from assigning all \nenrolments an Indigenous flag. Nevertheless, for the first time the AEC has a very large number of \nenrolled persons, over 6 million, matched to Centrelink records with an explicit Indigenous status. \n\nThe enrolment rate, even for all persons regardless of indigeneity, is difficult to calculate reliably \ndue to conceptual, collection and methodological differences between the Roll (numerator) and the \nABS-based enrolment-eligible population (denominator, “EEP”). In the case of the Indigenous \npopulation these problems are magnified by having no Indigenous identifier on the Roll and less \nreliable estimates of Indigenous EEP.  \n\nHowever, matching the Roll to Centrelink data allows a more direct method of estimating the \nIndigenous enrolment rate. Results for 30 June 2018 are provided in Table 2. \n\nTable 2 - Estimated Indigenous Enrolment Rates, 30 June 2018 \n\nState \n\nEstimated \nIndigenous voting \nage population \n\nEstimated enrolled \n\nEstimated not \nenrolled \n\nEstimated enrolment \nrate \n\nNSW \n\nVIC \n\nQLD \n\nWA \n\nSA \n\nTAS \n\nACT \n\nNT \n\n164,845 \n\n36,538 \n\n135,642 \n\n64,545 \n\n26,522 \n\n18,004 \n\n5,000 \n\n50,563 \n\n143,891 \n\n27,775 \n\n98,357 \n\n41,182 \n\n18,622 \n\n15,150 \n\n3,971 \n\n34,130 \n\nAustralia \n\n501,659 \n\n383,078 \n\n20,954 \n\n8,763 \n\n37,285 \n\n23,363 \n\n7,900 \n\n2,854 \n\n1,029 \n\n16,433 \n\n118,581 \n\n87.3% \n\n76.0% \n\n72.5% \n\n63.8% \n\n70.2% \n\n84.1% \n\n79.4% \n\n67.5% \n\n76.4% \n\nIt is still subject to quite courageous assumptions, but as fewer are required it likely represents an \nimproved approach. In summary: \n\n  For all Centrelink customers with an identified Indigenous or non-Indigenous status, \n\ncalculate the proportion on the Roll. This is the raw enrolment rate of Centrelink clients. \n  Calculate the ratio of the actual AEC enrolment rate versus the Centrelink-based rate, for \nthe same point in time. This is the overall factor to adjust any Centrelink-based rates to \nalign with AEC enrolment rates. \n\n  Apply the adjustment factor to raw Centrelink-based enrolment rates by Indigenous status \n\nto give Indigenous and non-Indigenous enrolment rates. \n\nLS7888 Released Document No. 29Released under the Freedom of Information Act 1982\n\n\n--- Page 3 ---\n\n  This process can be done at the State level, though results will have lower reliability. \n\nIt should be noted that while this method avoids indirectly modelling Indigenous enrolment rates via \ngeographic association, it does assume that any bias in Centrelink clients being enrolled is equal \nfor Indigenous and non-Indigenous, and that there are no substantive Indigenous-status biases \ninherent in the Roll-to-Centrelink person matching. \n\nCentrelink data \n\nThe number of Indigenous Australians that are identified both on the Centrelink file sent to the AEC \nin July 2018 and the electoral Roll does not represent all Indigenous enrolments. It is limited to \nthose Indigenous Australians who both receive a Centrelink benefit and who have self-identified as \nIndigenous to Centrelink. \n\nAfter considerable data cleansing and analysis the AEC identified 72,451 potentially unenrolled \nIndigenous Australians. This represents around 61 per cent of the 118,581 Indigenous Australians \nthe AEC estimate were not enrolled as at 30 June 2018 (see Table 2 above). \n\nThe enrolment stimulation event conducted in February/March 2019 using 2018 Centrelink data \nresulted in the enrolment of 2,646 people who indicated they were Indigenous. This reduced the \nestimated number of unenrolled Indigenous Australians identified in the Centrelink dataset to \n69,143. Table 3 sets out the distribution of this cohort across states and Table 4 provides the data \nfor electoral divisions. \n\nIt is important to note that the potential unenrolled under 65 Indigenous Australians as at the 2019 \nclose of rolls represents those people that are on the Centrelink file sent to the AEC in July 2018 \nand who were included in the February 2019 enrolment stimulation event but had not enrolled as at \nthe 2019 close of rolls (18 April 2019). \n\nAnalysis of the Centrelink potentially unenrolled Indigenous Australians 65 years and older \nidentified significant matching error, due to the quality of data input and the nature of the residential \nstatus of this cohort. Work will be undertaken on the 2019 dataset to better understand this \nphenomenon to facilitate better targeting of potentially unenrolled indigenous Australians in the \nfuture. \n\nTable 3 –
