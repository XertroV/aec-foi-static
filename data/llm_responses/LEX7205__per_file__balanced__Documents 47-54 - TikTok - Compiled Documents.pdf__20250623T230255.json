The \"Online Platform Scenarios\" for FE24/25 were also on the agenda.\n*   **January-February 2025:** Further meetings were planned and executed, with the AEC posing specific questions to TikTok. These included queries about positive uses of the platform for electoral education, the algorithm's prioritisation of authoritative information (like the AEC), election-specific filters, changes to referral pathways (including legal referrals) since the 2023 referendum, and crucial lessons learned/guardrails for AI-enabled misinformation observed in previous elections.\n*   **February 2025:** Collaboration on developing an \"in-app\" election information hub. TikTok proposed draft text for a \"2025 Australian Election guide\" to be included in its app, which the AEC's Media & Digital Engagement team reviewed and approved, aiming to direct users to authoritative AEC information on voting processes and rights.\n*   **March 2025:** TikTok sent a formal letter to the AEC Acting Commissioner outlining its comprehensive commitment to protecting platform integrity for FE25.\n\n**TikTok's Commitments and Actions Highlighted:**\n*   **Policy Updates:** Refined Civic and Election Integrity policies to protect election workers and updated AI-Generated Content (AIGC) policies to require user and auto-labelling of AIGC, with a prohibition on harmful AIGC (e.g., fake authoritative sources, crisis events, false public figure endorsements).\n*   **Content Moderation & Trust & Safety:** Ongoing investment in Trust & Safety functions, maintaining fact-checking infrastructure in Australia, and committing to removing violative content through proactive moderation, user reports, and AEC escalations.\n*   **Combating Malign Influence:** Expanded state-affiliated media policies (restricting \"For You\" feed recommendations and advertising outside their home country) and introduced monthly public reporting on Covert Influence Operations via its Transparency Centre.\n*   **Operational Readiness for FE25:** Established a dedicated core working group to assess AEC reports, update moderation systems, and adapt to emerging content trends during the election period.\n*   **Specific Electoral Integrity Measures:**\n    *   Maintaining a prohibition on paid political advertising.\n    *   Providing active reporting portal access for the AEC to flag content of concern.\n    *   Implementing in-app redirection to authoritative AEC election information (website and TikTok account).\n    *   Conducting impersonation sweeps for verified Australian political candidates.\n    *   Issuing election-specific policy guidance for its moderation system, including for AIGC.\n    *   Establishing a communication pathway with other government agencies for timely responses to issues affecting public figures (e.g., Members of Parliament).\n\n### Relevance to the FOI Request\n\nThis document is highly relevant to the FOI request as it provides concrete evidence of the extensive engagement between the AEC and TikTok to safeguard electoral integrity for the 2025 Federal Election. It directly demonstrates:\n\n*   **Extensive Interactions:** Multiple scheduled meetings, detailed email correspondence, and formal letters exchanged between the AEC's EIAT/DDU and TikTok.\n*   **Collaboration Mechanisms:** Details how TikTok is collaborating with the AEC through direct communication channels, dedicated working groups, and an established reporting portal.\n*   **Addressing Key Themes:** Explicitly covers the core themes outlined in the FOI request overview:\n    *   **Countering misinformation and disinformation:** Evidenced by TikTok's policy updates, fact-checking, and reporting on covert influence operations.\n    *   **Managing AI-generated content (AIGC):** TikTok's specific policies on labeling, auto-labelling, and content removal, as well as the AEC's direct inquiries about AI misuse.\n    *   **Applying lessons from global elections:** A consistent agenda item for discussions.\n    *   **Streamlining referral and escalation pathways:** Confirmed active reporting portal and communication channels.\n    *   **Supporting media literacy campaigns:** Demonstrated through the collaborative development of the in-app election information hub.\n*   **Platform Preparations:** Highlights TikTok's proactive measures for FE25, including policy updates (e.g., AI content disclosure), the establishment of a dedicated working group, and the facilitation of direct communication to ensure a secure and credible information environment."

  "prompt": "Considering this document as part of an FOI request, summarize the document and its relevance to the FOI request in markdown format. FYI the overview of the FOI request is: The Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) sought information via an FOI request regarding its engagement with major online platforms—Google/YouTube, Meta (Facebook/Instagram), Microsoft/LinkedIn, and TikTok—to safeguard electoral integrity ahead of the 2025 Federal Election (FE25). The released documents reveal extensive interactions, including meeting invitations, email correspondence, and formal letters, detailing how these platforms are collaborating with the AEC's Electoral Integrity Assurance Taskforce (EIAT) and Defending Democracy Unit (DDU). Key themes include countering misinformation and disinformation, managing AI-generated content (AIGC) like deepfakes through detection, labeling, and provenance initiatives, applying lessons from global elections, streamlining referral and escalation pathways for problematic content, and supporting media literacy campaigns. Each platform is actively preparing for FE25 by updating policies (e.g., AI content disclosure), offering cybersecurity tools, establishing dedicated working groups, and facilitating direct communication channels with the AEC to ensure a secure and credible information environment.\n\nDocument Text:\n\n\n\n--- Page 1 ---\n\nFrom:\nSent:\nTo:\nSubject:\n\nAttachments:\n\nCategories:\n\nWednesday, 12 March 2025 8:39 PM\nDefending Democracy Unit; \nFW: [External] Letter from the Commissioner | TikTok’s commitment to the ‘AI \nElections Accord’ and Australia’s Upcoming Federal Election [SEC=OFFICIAL]\n11.03.2025 - Pope, Jeff - TikTok Australia.pdf\n\nFor our information and records! \n\n | Director  \n\nDefending Democracy Unit | Electoral Integrity and Media Branch \nAustralian Electoral Commission \n\nFrom: Jeff Pope  \nSent: Wednesday, 12 March 2025 1:31 PM \nTo: Michael Lynch ; Matthew Haigh ; \nCc: \nSubject: FW: [External] Letter from the Commissioner | TikTok’s commitment to the ‘AI Elections Accord’ \nand Australia’s Upcoming Federal Election [SEC=OFFICIAL] \n\n ; Kath Gleeson  \n\nResponse from TikTok for your awareness. \n\nRegards \n\nJP \n\nJeﬀ Pope APM \nAc(cid:415)ng Electoral Commissioner \n\nAustralian Electoral Commission \n\n1\n\ns 47Fs 47Fs 47Fs 47Fs 47Fs 47Es 47Fs 47Fs22\n\n\n--- Page 2 ---\n\nFrom: \nSent: Wednesday, 12 March 2025 10:30 AM \nTo: Jeff Pope \nCc: Rebecca Borys \nSubject: FW: [External] Letter from the Commissioner | TikTok’s commitment to the ‘AI Elections Accord’ \nand Australia’s Upcoming Federal Election [SEC=OFFICIAL] \n\nHi Jeff \n\nPlease see attached response from TikTok. \n\n | Personal Assistant to the Commissioner  \n\nExecutive Leadership Team \nAustralian Electoral Commission \n\nFrom: \nSent: Wednesday, 12 March 2025 10:22 AM \nTo: \nCc: \n\nSubject: Re: [External] Letter from the Commissioner | TikTok’s commitment to the ‘AI Elections Accord’ \nand Australia’s Upcoming Federal Election [SEC=OFFICIAL] \n\nCAUTION: This email originated from outside of the Australian Federal Government.

As emphasised in our recent direct engagement with\nthe Australian Electoral Commission, including members of the Electoral Integrity Taskforce,\nwe continue to invest in our Trust & Safety function, maintain our fact-checking infrastructure,\nincluding in Australia, and treat Federal elections with the seriousness they warrant, noting\nmany of the global concerns you raise.\n\nAs part of this ongoing work, in 2024 we updated our Civic and Election Integrity policies to\nprovide greater clarity around protections for election workers, or observers, who might face\nintimidation or harassment in the course of these critical events. We also continue to refine\nour AI-Generated Content (AIGC) policies to respond to emerging trends and threats. These\npolicies now require users to label AIGC content, using in-app features, and we also apply\nauto-labelling ourselves. We recognise that even when appropriately labelled, AIGC and edited\nmedia may still be harmful. We do not allow content that shares or shows fake authoritative\nsources or crisis events, or falsely shows public figures in certain contexts including being\nbullied, making an endorsement, or being endorsed. In these instances, we will remove the\nviolative content through proactive moderation, user reports, and reports as escalated by the\nAEC.\n\nNoting the global threat landscape, including around elections, in 2024 we also expanded our\nstate-affiliated media policies to further address state-affiliated media accounts that attempt\nto reach communities outside their home country on current global events and affairs. When\n\n\n--- Page 5 ---\n\nwe  identify  these  accounts,  they  will  become  ineligible  for  recommendation,  which  means \ntheir  content  won't  appear  in  the  For  You  feed  -  the  primary  way  TikTok  users  discover \ncontent. In addition, if these accounts advertise on our platform, they will not be allowed to \n\nadvertise  outside  of  the  country  with  which  they  are  primarily  affiliated.  Importantly,  in \nrelation to Covert Influence Operations, in 2024, we also introduced monthly public reporting, \nwhich we publish on our Transparency Centre.1 These reports disclose the detection source, \nthe  target  location(s)  of  such  operations,  the  number  of  accounts  in  a  network,  and  the \nnumber of followers those accounts might have had. We leverage our global team's expertise \n\nand insights in relation to any potential threats in Australia and, where we detect these, we \ndisclose them.  \n\nFor  the  upcoming  federal  election  in  Australia,  TikTok  has  established  a  dedicated  core \nworking group to assess and respond to reports we receive from the AEC, ensure moderation \n\nsystems  are  up-to-date,  and  adapt  to  unfolding  events  as  they  might  emerge  during  the \nelectoral period (including content related trends, whether concerning AICG or other types of \ncontent).  \n\nWe have taken specific actions to support the safety and integrity of the 2025 Federal Election, \n\nincluding:  \n\n1.  Upholding our prohibition on paid political advertising on-platform. This includes both \ntraditional  paid  advertisements  and  creators  receiving  compensation  to  support  or \noppose a candidate. \n\n2.  Maintaining an active TikTok reporting portal access for the AEC to report content of \n\nconcern.  \n\n3.  Providing re-direction, in-app, to authoritative election-related information for content \nconcerning  the  federal  election,  including  linking  to  the  AEC's  website  and  TikTok \naccount. \n\n4.  Conducting  impersonation  sweeps  for  accounts  that  are  verified  as  belonging  to \nAustralian political candidates, including existing elected Members and Senators, with \nappropriate enforcement action taken as a result.  \n\n5.  Issuing policy guidance specific to the election for our moderation system, including \n\nguidance that covers AIGC.  \n\n6.  Establishing a pathway for communication with other government agencies, including \nas it concerns the safety of Members of Parliament, to enable a timely response to \nissues that may arise in the Australian community during the electoral period.  \n\n1 Available at https://www.tiktok.com/transparency/en/covert-influence-operations.  \n\n2\n\n\n--- Page 6 ---\n\ncd TikTok\n\nWe are happy to clarify any of these matters via further discussion with the AEC, and we look\nforward to working alongside the AEC to ensure a safe 2025 Federal Election on TikTok.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nMemector of Public Policy |\n\nTikTok Australia\n\n\n--- Page 7 ---\n\nMonday, 17 February 2025 9:16 AM\n\n; Defending Democracy Unit\n\nMeeting reminder and advance notice of questions during EIAT Chair's brief \n[SEC=OFFICIAL]\n\nFrom:\nSent:\nTo:\nCc:\nSubject:\n\nCategories:\n\nGood morning\n\nAhead of our mee(cid:415)ng today at 1pm , I just wanted to give you the heads up about a couple of ques(cid:415)ons the EIAT TF \nChair, Ma(cid:425) Haigh, will ask you over the course of the update from the AEC/EIAT.  \n\n  What are some of the posi(cid:415)ve ways TikTok has been used during an elec(cid:415)on? (For example, community \neduca(cid:415)on campaigns, encouraging people to enrol and to vote. We note some reputable sources such as \nthe ABC have posted ‘How To Vote’ videos.) \n\n  Does the TikTok algorithm give priority to authorita(cid:415)ve sources of informa(cid:415)on about an elec(cid:415)on? For \n\nexample, AEC, ABC and other authorita(cid:415)ve sources of informa(cid:415)on. \n\n  Does TikTok have any elec(cid:415)on speciﬁc ﬁlters (no(cid:415)ng Snap has something, but this may work diﬀerently on \n\nTikTok) \n\n  Have referral pathways changed since the 2023 referendum? \n  Have there been any changes to TikTok’s processes or referral pathways for legal referrals? \n  We’re aware that the use of AI to enable the spread of mis and disinforma(cid:415)on remains an existen(cid:415)al \nchallenge for everyone in the online environment, including TikTok.

Check multiple sources of information, \nparticularly if you’re not sure of the information's authenticity. For information about the Australian \nfederal election - including voting processes and your rights and obligations under Australian law - go to \nthe AEC.  \n\n  Tips to ‘stop and consider’  \n \n\nLearn about the voting process  \n\nWays to vote \nAustralia has some of the best voting options in the world.  \n\nIf you can vote on election day, then that is what you should do. If you can’t make it on election day you \ncan vote during the two-week early voting period – either in-person or via post. Plan your vote according \nto your circumstances. \n\n  Election day: in your local area or at dedicated interstate voting centres.  \n\n  Pre-polling: in-person at an early voting centre - anywhere around Australia or at an overseas \n\nvoting centre \n\n  Mobile voting: via a mobile voting team visiting remote communities, residential care facilities, \n\nsome hospitals and a range of other locations of need.    \n\n  Postal voting: if you can't make it to a voting centre \n\nHead here for more information and options. \n\nPreferential voting \nVoting in the federal election is compulsory for all Australian citizens aged 18+ on the electoral roll. Know \nhow the Australian preferential voting system works before you head to a voting centre \n\nWhere to vote \nVoting locations will be available in the week before the voting period starts.  \n\n-  Find your federal electoral division \n-  Find my nearest voting centre \n\n2\n\n\n--- Page 19 ---\n\n[The second link here will change substantially after the election has been announced] \n\nHappy to discuss if there are any questions or points of clarity that I can assist with. \n\nRegards, \n\nDirector of Public Policy, Australia and New Zealand \n\nTo help p otect y ou  p v acy  M c osoft Off ce p ev ented au omat c download of th s pictu e f om the Inte net\n\n3\n\ns 47Fs 47F\n\n\n--- Page 20 ---\n\nFrom:\nSent:\nTo:\nCc:\nSubject:\n\nGood a(cid:332)ernoon,\n\nEIAT\nThursday, 16 January 2025 4:55 PM\n\nDefending Democracy Unit; EIAT; \n\nRequest for meeting with EIAT representatives [SEC=OFFICIAL]\n\nI hope this email ﬁnds you well and you enjoyed your Christmas break. \n\nIn prepara(cid:415)on for the next federal elec(cid:415)on, the Electoral Integrity Assurance Taskforce (EIAT) are \narranging mee(cid:415)ngs with each of the online pla(cid:414)orms.
