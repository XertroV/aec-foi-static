The Commission decided to set aside the delegate's decision to deregister the **Seniors United Party of Australia**, re-registering the party instead. It also considered the application for registration from **The New Liberals**, confirming the party met the 500-member requirement based on endorsed methodology. However, the Commission ruled that the name \"The New Liberals\" too closely resembled \"Liberal Party of Australia\" and/or \"Liberal,\" setting aside the delegate's decision to register the party and instead refusing its application for registration.\n\n### Relevance to FOI Request\nThis document is highly relevant to the FOI request as it falls within the specified date range (March 2, 2021, to October 19, 2022).

Do not include any conversational filler or preamble.To aid you, the overview of the FOI request is: [REQUEST OVERVIEW START] An FOI request sought minutes from Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) meetings held between March 2, 2021, and October 19, 2022, resulting in the release of seven sets of endorsed, edited minutes. These documents primarily detail the Commission's decisions and discussions concerning political party registration, deregistration, and name changes, alongside the evolving methodology for verifying party membership, particularly in response to legislative amendments increasing the minimum member requirement from 500 to 1,500. Key discussions included seeking Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) advice on membership testing, and specific rulings on party names (e.g., \"The New Liberals,\" \"Liberal Democratic Party\"), deregistration (e.g., \"Australian People’s Party,\" \"VOTEFLUX.ORG\"), and re-registration (e.g., \"Seniors United Party of Australia\").\n [REQUEST OVERVIEW END] \n\n--- MAIN DOCUMENT TEXT START ---\n\n\n\n--- Page 1 ---\n\nMinutes \n\nAustralian Electoral Commission \nMeeting No. 276 \n\nDate: Wednesday 17 November 2021  Time: 4:00pm  Location: Microsoft Teams \n\nAttendees:  \nThe Hon.

Welcome \n\n2.  For decision: Seniors United Party of Australia \n\n3.  For decision: The New Liberals \n\n4.  Closing \n\nAgenda item 1: Welcome and Commissioner’s introduction \n\nThe meeting opened at 4:00pm with the three-person Australian Electoral Commission (the \nCommission) in attendance; the Hon. Justice Susan Kenny, Mr Tom Rogers, and \nDr David Gruen. \n\nsection 47F\n\n\n--- Page 2 ---\n\nAgenda item 2: For decision: Seniors United Party of Australia \n\nIn relation to the application for review regarding the deregistration of the Seniors United \nParty of Australia, the Commission examined and discussed the material before it, including \nthe results of the assessment of the revised membership list submitted by the Party on 23 \nSeptember 2021. \n\nThe Commission decided:  \n\n•  To set aside the decision of the delegate made under s 137(6) of the Commonwealth \nElectoral Act 1918 (Cth) on 9 March 2021 to deregister the Seniors United Party of \nAustralia; and \n\n•  To substitute a decision to take all such steps as are necessary to give effect to its \n\ndecision, including to maintain the registration of the Seniors United Party of Australia \nby re-registering that Party. \n\nAgenda item 3: For decision: The New Liberals \n\nThe Electoral Commissioner noted that The New Liberals sought his recusal from the review \nof the delegate’s decision to register The New Liberals “on the basis of reasonable \napprehension of bias”, for the reasons stated in a document dated 5 July 2021.  The \nElectoral Commissioner advised that he had no “material personal interest” within s 29 of the \nPublic Governance, Performance and Accountability Act 2013; no “direct or indirect \npecuniary interest” within s 11 of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918; and that there was \nno basis for a reasonable apprehension of bias on his part.  Having considered the matters \nraised by The New Liberals, the other members of the Commission agreed that there was no \nbasis shown for the Electoral Commissioner to withdraw from the review.   \n\nIn relation to the applications for review, the Commission examined and discussed the \nmaterial before it, including the material provided by the Liberal Party of Australia, the \nNational Party of Australia and The New Liberals, and the material before the delegate in \nmaking the decision under review.  The Commission was satisfied that an assessment of the \nmembership list submitted by The New Liberals showed that The New Liberals has at least \n500 members, and that the assessment was made in conformity with the sampling \nmethodology endorsed by the Commission.  The Commission concluded, however, that the \nname “The New Liberals” so nearly resembles the name, “Liberal Party of Australia” and/or \nthe abbreviation “Liberal” that it is likely to be confused with or mistaken for that name or that \nabbreviation, as the case may be.  Accordingly, the application for registration by The New \nLiberals must be refused pursuant to s 129(1)(d) of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918.  \n\nThe Commission decided: \n\n•  To set aside the decision of the delegate made on 3 June 2021 to register The New \nLiberals (the Party) under Part XI of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 (the Act); \nand  \n\n•  To substitute a decision to refuse the application to register the Party as a political \n\nparty under Part XI of the Act; \n\n•  To take all such steps as are necessary to give effect to the Commission’s decision, \nincluding to remove the Party from the Register of Political Parties maintained under \ns 125 of the Act.  \n\nMinutes: Australian Electoral Commission Meeting No. 276 \n\nPage 2\n\n\n--- Page 3 ---\n\nAgenda item 4: Closing \n\nThe Chairperson thanked members for attending and closed the meeting at 5:00pm. \n\nMinutes: Australian Electoral Commission Meeting No. 276 \n\nPage 3\n\n"
