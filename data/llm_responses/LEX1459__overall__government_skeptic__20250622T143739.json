            "text": "These FOI documents reveal the **AEC's swift move to deregister \"VOTEFLUX.ORG | Upgrade Democracy!\"**, raising significant questions about government transparency, efficiency, and the fairness of its bureaucratic processes.\n\nDespite the party submitting a membership list claiming **4,680 members—well over triple the 1,500 threshold**—the AEC chose to test only a **selected \"top 1,650 names.\"** This selective auditing, vaguely justified as conforming to \"AEC’s testing methodology parameters,\" lacks transparency regarding its criteria and rationale. The decision to audit a pre-determined, smaller subset, rather than a sample proportional to the claimed membership, suggests a potential intent to *find* grounds for deregistration rather than objectively verify claims, or an internal process that prioritizes efficiency over comprehensive scrutiny.\n\nFurthermore, the documents highlight **potential government inefficiency and the questionable use of taxpayer funds.** While the AEC was actively preparing to deregister the party, it simultaneously processed and even engaged an external entity (CRE8IVE) to assess the party’s application to change its name and logo. This resulted in resources being expended on an application that was rendered invalid upon the party's deregistration, indicating a **clear lack of inter-departmental coordination or foresight** within the AEC. This suggests public funds may have been wasted on redundant administrative tasks due to parallel, uncoordinated processes.\n\nThe ultimate conclusion, stating the party \"failed to demonstrate\" sufficient members based on an unspecified \"ABS methodology,\" provides minimal insight into the actual testing results or how 4,680 claimed members could not yield 1,500 valid ones. This reliance on opaque methodology, coupled with the seemingly contradictory parallel processes, underscores a system where **government action can be swift and resource-intensive, yet lack clear justification and transparent execution.** The very existence of this FOI request itself points to a public need to scrutinize these often-unaccountable government functions."

(the Party) \n\nPurpose \n\nThis minute asks you, as a delegate of the Electoral Commission, to deregister the Party under \ns 137(6) of the Electoral Act on the grounds that the Party does not have at least 1,500 members \n(s 137(1)(b) of the Electoral Act).  \n\nAuthority \n\nSections 123, 137, 138 and 138A of the Electoral Act. \n\nBackground \n\nOn 13 January 2022, you, as a delegate of the Electoral Commission, issued a notice to the \nRegistered Officer of the Party, Mr Nathan Spataro, under s 137 of the Electoral Act (the s 137 \nNotice) stating that the Electoral Commission is considering deregistering the Party (OBJECT IDs: \nA1319272 and A1442167). The Registered Officer of the Party had until 13 February 2022 to provide \na response.  \n\nOn 13 February 2022, the Party responded to the s 137 Notice: \n\n•  Response received – OBJECT ID: A1369037 \n•  Statement – OBJECT ID: A1369035 \n•  Supplementary membership list – OBJECT ID: A1369039 \n\nOn 2 March 2022, you, as a delegate of the Electoral Commission, having considered the statement \nlodged by the Party, and membership list lodged in support of that statement containing 4,680 \nnames, requested that further membership testing be performed. In confirming your advice, you \ninstructed to select the top 1,650 names for testing to conform with the AEC’s testing methodology \nparameters. Please see OBJECT ID: A1406912. \n\nMinute  \n\nPage 1\n\n\n--- Page 2 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 3 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 4 ---\n\nOFFICIAL \n\nApplication to change the Party’s name, abbreviation and logo in the Register \n\nOn 19 February 2022, the Party lodged an application in accordance with s 134 of the Electoral Act \nto change its name, abbreviation and logo in the Register (OBJECT ID: A1396302). The Party’s logo \npassed validation and has been assessed by CRE8IVE (OBJECT IDs: A1421693 and A1421695). If \nthe Party is deregistered, the application lodged under s 134 of the Electoral Act will no longer be \nvalid. \n\nConclusion \n\nOn 13 January 2022, a notice was issued a notice to the Registered Officer of the Party under s 137 \nof the Electoral Act stating that the Electoral Commission is considering deregistering the Party \n\nOn 13 February 2022, the party responded to the s 137 Notice providing a statement and a \nmembership list in support of that statement. \n\nAn assessment of the Party’s membership list was undertaken and based on the ABS methodology it \ndemonstrated that the Party has failed to demonstrate to have at least 1,500 members.  \n\nAccordingly, there are reasonable grounds on which you, as the delegate of the Electoral \nCommission, can be satisfied that the Party does not have at least 1,500 members. Based on this \ninformation, you may determine under s 138A of the Electoral Act that the Party is not an ‘eligible \npolitical party’ and should be deregistered. \n\nIf you, as the delegate of the Electoral Commission is of this view, you should not deregister the \nParty under s 137 of the Electoral Act and advise the Registered Officer of this decision.  \n\nMinute  \n\nPage 4\n\n\n--- Page 5 ---\n\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 1 ---\n\n\n\nProvide only the markdown formatted summary text.
