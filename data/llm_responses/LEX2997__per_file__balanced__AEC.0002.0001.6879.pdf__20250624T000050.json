            "text": "This document is a formal notice issued by the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) Chief Legal Officer, Andrew Johnson, to Dr Andrew Laming MP on 2 June 2021. Issued under Section 321F of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918, the notice compels Dr Laming to provide information and documents related to suspected contraventions of Section 321D of the Act.\n\nThe AEC suspects Dr Laming, as a \"Disclosure Entity,\" communicated \"electoral matter\" on various Facebook pages between 18 November 2018 and 18 May 2019 without including the mandatory authorisation particulars required by Section 321D(5). Pages specifically identified and suspected to be administered by Dr Laming include \"Redland Hospital: Let's Fight for Fair Funding,\" \"Redland Bay Bulletin,\" \"Redlands Institute,\" \"Thornlands 4164,\" and \"Victoria Point News.\"\n\nThe notice requires Dr Laming to produce comprehensive information, including:\n*   Identification of all Facebook pages he or his designated Facebook account administered or posted to, including time periods, administrative roles, and public/private status.\n*   Details of instructions given regarding page content or operation.\n*   Explanation of steps taken to disclose mandatory authorisation particulars (name and relevant town/city).\n*   Information concerning email addresses associated with his Facebook account.\n\nAdditionally, Dr Laming is required to produce documents, including:\n*   Complete current and historical electronic copies of the specified Facebook pages.\n*   Any documents (emails, chat messages, etc.) concerning communications related to the creation, changes, or administration of these pages.\n\nThe notice warns that providing false or misleading information or documents is a criminal offence under the Criminal Code.\n\n**Relevance to FOI Request:**\nThis document directly addresses the core components of the FOI request overview. It serves as a concrete example of the \"formal notices to Laming for detailed information\" issued by the AEC as part of its investigation. The notice explicitly names pages like \"Redland Bay Bulletin\" and \"Redlands Institute,\" which were highlighted in the FOI request overview as being allegedly disguised community/news groups used to promote political content without mandatory disclosures. By referencing sections 321D and 321F of the Electoral Act, the document underscores the AEC's focus on the expanded social media authorisation laws introduced by the 2018 amendments, aligning with the FOI request's context. The requested information and documents are crucial for the AEC to assess compliance with the authorisation laws, directly supporting the investigative activities described in the FOI request."

Do not include any conversational filler or preamble.To aid you, the overview of the FOI request is: [REQUEST OVERVIEW START] The FOI request disclosed documents detailing the Australian Electoral Commission's (AEC) investigation into Andrew Laming MP's Facebook pages for compliance with federal electoral authorisation laws. This inquiry was triggered by public complaints and media reports, notably from *The Guardian*, alleging Laming used numerous pages (e.g., \"Redland Bay Bulletin,\" \"Redlands Institute\") disguised as community or news groups to promote political content and attack opponents without mandatory disclosures. The AEC confirmed an active investigation, noting 2018 Electoral Act amendments broadened social media authorisation, and issued formal notices to Laming for detailed information and to third parties (like Facebook) for data, with Facebook confirming its cooperation. Findings revealed some pages were removed or updated with authorisation, while others remained active and unauthorised.\n [REQUEST OVERVIEW END] \n\n--- MAIN DOCUMENT TEXT START ---\n\n\n\n--- Page 1 ---\n\nAEC.0002.0001.6879\n\nh)AEC Australian Electoral Commission • Dr Andrew Laming alaming2@bigpond.com Dear Dr Laming NOTICE UNDER SECTION 321 F OF THE COMMONWEAL TH ELECTORAL ACT 1918 Whereas I, Andrew Johnson, a delegate of the Electoral Commissioner, have reason to believe that Dr Laming (you) have information and documents relating to assessment of compliance with section 321 D of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 (Electoral Act).
