Acknowledging the absence of a personal Indigenous identifier on the federal electoral roll, the AEC's decision to leverage Centrelink's \"Indigenous indicator\" creates a de facto administrative identifier by linking sensitive welfare data with electoral records.\n\nThis initiative, explicitly driven by \"Closing the Gap purposes,\" signals a problematic expansion of government function beyond its core electoral mandate into social engineering. Rather than neutrally applying electoral law, the AEC is actively pursuing specific demographic enrolment rates, deviating from the principle of limited government. Furthermore, the document itself undermines the program's precision and efficacy, admitting the methodology relies on \"courageous assumptions\" and that results are \"indicative only\" and \"unofficial internal AEC modelling.\" This raises significant questions about the responsible allocation of taxpayer funds towards a program built on acknowledged methodological weaknesses, while simultaneously infringing on individual privacy by consolidating government data on citizens' ethnic identity without explicit consent on the electoral roll itself."

  "prompt": "From a right-leaning perspective, summarize this specific document within the context of the FOI request. Emphasize its implications for market freedom, government overreach, or national interest. The overall FOI overview is: From a right-leaning perspective, the Australian Electoral Commission's 2018-2019 reforms to its Indigenous Electoral Participation Program, while ostensibly aimed at improving enrolment, raise significant concerns regarding fiscal responsibility, individual liberty, and the scope of government. The undisclosed costs for designing, testing, and implementing the new methodology, alongside expenses for \"enrolment stimulation events,\" represent a severe lack of financial transparency and accountability for taxpayer funds. Furthermore, the reliance on cross-agency data sharing—matching Centrelink's self-identified Indigenous status with the electoral roll—creates a de facto administrative identifier, infringing on individual privacy and expanding government reach beyond its core electoral function into social engineering. This active pursuit of specific demographic enrolment rates, driven by a \"Closing the Gap\" mandate, deviates from the principle of limited government and highlights a move away from neutral application of electoral law, while the methodology's acknowledged \"courageous assumptions\" and fluctuating outcomes further question its precision and efficacy.\n\nDocument Text:\n\nIndigenous Franchise KPIs using Centrelink data \n\nBackground \nAs Australia’s federal electoral roll does not have a personal Indigenous identifier, estimating the enrolment, \n rates for Indigenous persons is problematic. Having these key franchise KPIs for the \n\nIndigenous population is important for Closing the Gap purposes and the AECs focus on how the franchise \ncould be better delivered. \n\nIn 2014 the AEC’s Research Section commenced indirect estimation of these figures, using a regression model \nof the relationship between the Indigenous population and each of the three franchise KPIs at a small area \nlevel, such as polling place catchment or the ABS’ SA2 geography. While the models did not fit the data \nparticularly well, the resulting Indigenous enrolment, \nreal data, rather than anecdote. Yet the resulting enrolment and turnout rates in particular were alarmingly \nlow, and hopefully represented a worst case picture. \n\n rates were statistically based on \n\nCentrelink Data \nAround the same time, the Research Section informally proposed that person-level Centrelink extracts that the \nAEC received occasionally for other Roll validation work, could perhaps be extended to include Centrelink’s \nIndigenous indicator. This came to fruition in 20171. \n\nAs part of the Annual Roll Integrity Review (ARIR), the person-level matching between the Roll and Centrelink \nnow included Centrelink’s Indigenous indicator. However as Centrelink customers represent only around half \nof the Roll, the matching (even if perfect) would be far from assigning all enrolments an Indigenous flag. \nNevertheless, for the first time the AEC has a very large number of enrolled persons, over 6 million, with an \nexplicit Indigenous status. \n\nEnrolment Rate\n\n1.\nThe enrolment rate, even for all persons regardless of indigenaity, is difficult to calculate reliably due to \nconceptual, collection and methodological differences between the Roll (numerator) and the ABS-based \nenrolment-eligible population (denominator, “EEP”). In the case of the Indigenous population these problems \nare magnified by having no Indigenous identifier on the Roll and less reliable estimates of Indigenous EEP.  \n\nHowever, matching the Roll to Centrelink data allows a more direct method of estimating the Indigenous \nenrolment rate. It is still subject to quite courageous assumptions, but as fewer are required it likely \nrepresents an improved approach. In summary: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor all Centrelink customers with an identified Indigenous or non-Indigenous status, calculate the\nproportion on the Roll. This is the raw enrolment rate of Centrelink clients.\nCalculate the ratio of the actual AEC enrolment rate versus the Centrelink-based rate, for the same\npoint in time. This is the overall factor to adjust any Centrelink-based rates to align with AEC\nenrolment rates.\nApply the adjustment factor to raw Centrelink-based enrolment rates by Indigenous status to give\nIndigenous and non-Indigenous enrolment rates.\nThis process can be done at the State level, though results will have lower reliability.\n\nNOTE: While this method avoids indirectly modelling Indigenous enrolment rates via geographic \nassociation, it does assume that any bias in Centrelink clients being enrolled is equal for \nIndigenous and non-Indigenous, and that there are no substantive Indigenous-status biases \ninherent in the Roll-to-Centrelink person matching. \n\n1 Acknowledge with appreciation the work of the former Electoral Integrity Unit and the IT Branch. \n\n1919LS7888 Released Document No. 6Released under the Freedom of Information Act 1982\fConclusion and Results \nThe Centrelink client file with Indigenous indicator newly available to the AEC has presented an excellent \nopportunity, via matching to the Roll \n\n, to improve estimation of Indigenous franchise KPIs.  \n\nWhile the results are subject to a number of non-trivial assumptions, the more direct estimation methods lead \nto a higher likelihood of robust results. The figures should nevertheless still be regarded as indicative only. \n\n191919LS7888 Released Document No. 6Released under the Freedom of Information Act 1982 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fINDIGENOUS-STATUS FRANCHISE KPIs \n\nNon-enrolment (2017) \n\nKPI \n\nIndigenous  \n29% \n\nNon-\nIndigenous  \n3% \n\n^ enrolment \n\nINDIGENOUS-STATUS (NON-)ENROLMENT \n30 June 2017 \n\nState \n\nNSW \nVIC \nQLD \nSA \n\nWA \nTAS \nNT \nACT \nAUST \n\nIndigenous  \n17% \n28% \n32% \n34% \n39% \n19% \n30% \n26% \n29% \n\nNon-\nIndigenous  \n2% \n4% \n4% \n3% \n3% \n3% \n2% \n1% \n3% \n\nNotes: \nThese modelled national estimates contain many assumptions and cannot be ascribed to any particular sub-national location. \nThe absence of an Indigenous identifier on the Federal Roll has been partially supplemented with Centrelink information. \n\nThese figures can be footnoted \"unofficial internal AEC modelling\". \nBusiness Intelligence, Research and Electoral Integrity Section. 8 May 2018. \n\n19191919LS7888 Released Document No. 6Released under the Freedom of Information Act 1982 \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n\fREDACTION CODES \n\nPersonal Information (name) redacted. \n\nPersonal Information (date of birth) redacted. \n\nPersonal Information (photograph) redacted \n\nPersonal Information (facsimile of signature) redacted. \n\nPersonal Information (facsimile of manuscript initialling) redacted. \n\nPersonal Information (Individual’s address) redacted. \n\nPersonal Information (individual’s telephone number) redacted. \n\nPersonal Information (individual’s opinion) redacted. \n\nPersonal Information (opinion about individual) redacted. \n\nPersonal Information (employment history) redacted. \n\nPersonal Information (qualifications) redacted. \n\nPersonal Information (health) redacted. \n\nPersonal Information (identifying individual) redacted. \n\nBusiness information (Bank Account details) redacted. \n\nBusiness information (Billing Account details) redacted. \n\nBusiness information (internal operations) redacted. \n\nLegal Professional Communication redacted. \n\nDeliberative material redacted. \n\nIrrelevant material redacted. \n\nElectoral Roll material redacted. \n\nTests, examinations or audits material redacted. \n\nManagement or assessment of personnel material redacted. \n\nProper and efficient conduct of the operations of AEC material redacted. \n\nLawful methods or procedures for preventing, detecting, investigating, or \ndealing with matters arising out of, breaches or evasions of the law. \n\nTrade Secrets. \n\nCommercial valuable information. \n\nFinancial interests of the Commonwealth. \n\nProperty interests of the Commonwealth. \n\n1 \n\n2 \n\n3 \n\n4 \n\n5 \n\n6 \n\n7 \n\n8 \n\n9 \n\n10 \n\n11 \n\n12 \n\n13 \n\n14 \n\n15 \n\n16 \n\n17 \n\n18 \n\n19 \n\n20 \n\n21 \n\n22 \n\n23 \n\n24 \n\n25 \n\n26 \n\n27 \n\n28 \n\n\f\n\nProvide only the markdown formatted summary text.
