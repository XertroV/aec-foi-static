            "text": "The provided documents are the released materials associated with an FOI request.\n\n### Main Purpose of the FOI Request\n\nThe main purpose of the FOI request was to obtain information from the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) regarding its assessment of potential disclosure entities, particularly in relation to election campaign activities. Specifically, the request sought details on the AEC's review processes and determinations for entities like the Real Estate Institute of Australia (REIA), and broader data on the compliance status (e.g., outstanding obligations, lodged returns) of various financial disclosure entities, including political parties, third parties, donors, and associated entities, across several recent financial years (2015-16 to 2019 Federal Election).\n\n### Documents from the FOI Request\n\nThe released documents include:\n\n*   A partial internal AEC record (dated 15-May-19) assessing the Real Estate Institute of Australia (REIA) as a \"Potential Third Party\" discloser.\n*   An email dated 12 June 2020 from Joanne Reid, A/g Assistant Commissioner at the AEC, titled \"FW: RPP Response - Follow Up,\" indicating the release of information in response to the request.\n*   A list of numerous attachments accompanying the email, primarily \"SuperFAD Screenshot\" files, covering:\n    *   \"Third parties - no obligation letters\" for 2015-16, 2016-17, 2017-18.\n    *   \"Political party returns lodged\" and \"Political Party Outstanding Obligations\" for 2015-16, 2016-17, 2017-18, 2018-19.\n    *   \"Outstanding Obligations\" for Donors, Senate Groups, Candidates (2019 Federal Election), and Third Party and Associated Entities (2018-19).\n    *   A \"SSP Monthly Highlight Report as at 31 May 2020.xlsx\". (Note: Several listed attachments are marked \"Out of scope\" within the provided document).\n*   A partial document detailing the AEC's internal review process for determining whether to pursue entities as potential associated entities.\n\n### Main Content from the FOI Request Documents\n\nThe main content relating to the FOI request reveals:\n\n*   **Real Estate Institute of Australia (REIA) Assessment:** The AEC identified REIA as a potential third-party discloser in May 2019 due to its election campaign commentary. However, after reviewing its website and conducting Google searches, the AEC decided there was \"not enough evidence to pursue them as potential associated entities,\" concluding it was \"unlikely to have exceeded disclosure threshold.\" No formal record of this specific determination was kept.\n*   **AEC Assessment Process:** The AEC reviews media articles and entity websites and conducts Google searches to determine if there is sufficient evidence to pursue entities as potential disclosure entities.\n*   **Disclosure Compliance Data:** The list of attachments indicates that the request covered, and the AEC provided (at least in summary form), data related to the compliance status of various entities. This included information on \"no obligation letters\" issued to third parties, details of political party returns lodged and their outstanding obligations, and lists of outstanding obligations for donors, Senate groups, candidates, and other third and associated entities across multiple financial years leading up to and including the 2019 Federal Election."
