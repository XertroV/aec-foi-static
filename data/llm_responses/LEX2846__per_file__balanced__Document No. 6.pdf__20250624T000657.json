Do not include any conversational filler or preamble.To aid you, the overview of the FOI request is: [REQUEST OVERVIEW START] The FOI request LEX2846 illuminated the Australian Electoral Commission's (AEC) extensive preparations for conducting federal elections amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. Released documents detailed the **Commonwealth Electoral (COVID Enfranchisement) Regulations 2022**, establishing a secure telephone voting system for eligible self-isolating voters diagnosed close to polling day, supported by detailed \"Customer Journey\" plans and staff scripts. The AEC also adapted its **postal voting policy** for COVID-positive individuals and noted reduced mobile polling. Revealed were significant **logistical and financial challenges**, including projected cost increases and staffing difficulties, prompting the AEC to seek greater legislative flexibility for emergency election management. The AEC ensured **COVID-safe measures** at polling places and maintained the integrity of new voting methods through staff neutrality, scrutineer observation, and robust complaint mechanisms.\n [REQUEST OVERVIEW END] \n\n--- MAIN DOCUMENT TEXT START ---\n\n\n\n--- Page 1 ---\n\nName\n\nId\n\nFile Number\n\nOwner\n\nCreated On\n\nFOI request- COVID\n\n0.
