The released materials comprise a structured compilation including executive summaries, detailed sections for each hearing, various statistical and operational summaries (e.g., fast facts, infographics), and extensive \"Group briefs\"—often designated as Ministerial hot issue or back pocket briefs—from various AEC branches. These documents collectively provide a comprehensive overview of the AEC's operations, performance, and key issues, primarily in the context of the 2022 federal election and preparedness for a potential referendum. Key content areas covered include parliamentary engagement, financial matters, electoral operations and service delivery (e.g., diverse voting methods, roll management), electoral integrity and security (e.g., misinformation, foreign interference), regulatory functions (e.g., donations, redistributions), workforce and technology, and overall performance statistics.\n [REQUEST OVERVIEW END] \n\n--- MAIN DOCUMENT TEXT START ---\n\n\n\n--- Page 1 ---\n\nParliamentary hearings \n\nNovember 2022 \n\nExecutive summary \n\nJSCEM HEARING \n\n1 \n2 \n\n3 \n\n4 \n5 \n\nProgram \nMembers \n\nAEC JSCEM submission \n\nHansard – 28 September 2022 \nQuestions on notice \n\nESTIMATES HEARING \n\n6 \n7 \n8 \n\n9 \n\nProgram \nMembers \nHansard and corrections – 5 April 2022  \n\nQuestions on notice \n\nSUMMARIES \n\n10 \n11 \n\n12 \n\n13 \n14 \n15 \n\n16 \n\nCommissioner’s summary \nElection fast facts and key statistics  \n\nInfographic – Indigenous  \n\nInfographic – RAMP \nCommunication fast facts  \nFunding and disclosure fast facts  \n\nRedistributions fast facts \n\nAddenda if required \n\n17 \n\n18 \n19 \n\n20\n\n\n--- Page 2 ---\n\nGroup briefs \n\nHIB = Ministerial hot issue brief      The remainder are Executive back pock briefs \n\nGROUP \n\nDeputy Electoral Commissioner  \n\nFinance and Corporate Performance Branch \n\n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n\nAEC budget and new measures *HIB* \nCost of the 2022 federal election *HIB* \nReferendum: Funding arrangements \nFinancial matters \nPerformance Statements \nTravel \n\nCommunity and International Engagement Section \n\n27 \n\nIndigenous enrolment and engagement *HIB & BPB* \n\nAddenda if required \n\n28 \n29 \n30 \n\nGROUP \n\nService Delivery  \n\nStrategic Priorities Branch \n\n31 \n32 \n33 \n\nCOVID-19 – Voter enfranchisement  \nCOVID-19 – AEC response \nProperty footprint \n\nDelivery and Support Branch \n\n34 \n35 \n36 \n37 \n38 \n39 \n40 \n41 \n42 \n43 \n44 \n45 \n46 \n47 \n48 \n\nReferendum preparedness  \nCOVID safe elections *HIB & BPB* \nEarly voting  \nMobile polling   \nRemote Area Mobile Polling \nTelephone voting for electoral events *HIB* \nResidential aged care facilities *HIB* \nOverseas voting *HIB & BPB*  \nPostal voting management and integrity \nSenate count and assurance *HIB & BPB* \nEasyCount – Senate \nPolling place technology – Electronic Certified Lists \nVoter verification \nCandidate qualification checklist \nCommonwealth Procurement Rules – Environmental sustainability \n\nService Design and Foundations Branch \n\n49 \n50 \n51 \n52 \n53 \n54 \n\nState of the electoral roll \nJoint Roll Arrangements \nMeasures to address informality  \nInterpreting services \nElectoral legislation changes – 46th Parliament \nIndustrial elections and ballots \n\nAddenda if required \n\n55 \n56 \n57 \n\nCall Centre worker recordings – Senate ATL – \nNational Office Accommodation Project relocation costs\n\n\n--- Page 3 ---\n\nGROUP \n\nElectoral Integrity and Operations \n\nElectoral Integrity and Communications Branch \n\n58 \n59 \n60 \n61 \n62 \n63 \n\nForeign interference and electoral integrity *HIB* \nElectoral integrity and security \nPhysical security \nMisinformation and disinformation at the 2022 federal election \nElection time public information campaign  \nReferendum: YES/NO booklet and information campaigns \n\nState Operations \n\n64 \n65 \n\nClose counts in the 2022 federal election *HIB* \nGilmore count \n\nAddenda if required \n\n66 \n67 \n68 \n\nResponse to recent data breaches \n2GB Discarded ballot papers found – Port Macquarie \n\nGROUP \n\nEnabling and Regulation  \n\nDisclosure, Party Registration and Redistribution Branch \n\n69 \n70 \n71 \n72 \n73 \n74 \n75 \n76 \n\nParty registration  \nPolitical donations – Current laws and implementation *HIB* \nFunding and disclosure – Current matters \nFunding and disclosure – Historic matters \nFunding and disclosure – Disclosure amendments \nANAO audit of financial disclosure scheme management \nReferendum: Funding and disclosure obligations \nElectoral redistributions *HIB* \n\nLegal Services Branch \n\n77 \n78 \n79 \n80 \n81 \n82 \n\nTruth in electoral advertising \nMisleading or deceptive electoral communications  \nElectoral authorisations – Current matters \nMultiple marks and non-voting  \nReferendum: Legal framework and legislative readiness \nVendors, procurements and major tenders \n\nPeople Branch \n\n83 \n84 \n85 \n86 \n87 \n88 \n\nElectoral education \nWorkforce statistics \nTemporary Election Workforce \nPolitical neutrality requirements  \nStaff training \nAPS employee census findings \n\nAddenda if required \n\n89 \n90 \n91 \n\nGROUP \n\nOrganisational Transformation  \n\nEnterprise Strategy and Modernisation Branch \n\n92 \n93 \n\nElection systems modernisation *HIB* \nElection management systems \n\nDigital Technology Branch \n\n94 \n\nData centre and cloud-hosting services  \n\nAddenda if required \n\n95 \n96 \n97\n\n"
