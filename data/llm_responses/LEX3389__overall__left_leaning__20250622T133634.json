            "text": "The FOI documents provide a critical look into the Australian Electoral Commission's (AEC) methodology for verifying non-parliamentary political party membership, specifically in the context of the deregistration of \"VoteFlux.Org | Upgrade Democracy!\". From a left-leaning perspective, these documents highlight significant concerns regarding civil liberties, democratic participation, and the potential for government actions to create arbitrary barriers to political engagement.\n\n**Issues and Analysis:**\n\n*   **Civil Liberties & Democratic Participation (Deviation from Progressive Values):** The central revelation is that the AEC's decision to deregister \"VoteFlux.Org\" was based on a statistically flawed membership testing methodology. The Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) Chief Methodologist explicitly states that by sampling only the \"top 1650 names\" of the party's 4680-name list *without prior randomization*, it was \"not possible to draw any meaningful statistical conclusions\" about the party's whole list. This is a profound deviation from progressive values emphasizing fair process, due diligence, and robust evidence in governmental actions affecting democratic rights. The arbitrary nature of the sampling, as described, meant that the \"test done indicates a list with low proportion of eligible members among the 1650\" but could not accurately reflect the overall membership, thus unjustly leading to deregistration. This undermines the ability of grassroots movements and alternative political voices to participate equitably in the democratic process.\n*   **Wealth Distribution & Corporate Influence (Indirect Concern):** While not explicitly about wealth or corporate influence, the discussion around \"incentives of parties to keep good records\" and the potential for \"low quality lists\" to require \"very big sample sizes\" indirectly touches upon resource disparities. Smaller, emerging, or grassroots parties—often those challenging established power structures or advocating for social justice—may have fewer administrative resources to maintain \"high quality\" membership lists in the exact format required by the AEC, or to absorb the burden of larger sample sizes. This could create an uneven playing field, inadvertently favoring larger, wealthier, and more established parties, thereby entrenching existing power dynamics.\n*   **Government Action & Transparency (Mixed Alignment):** The very existence of these FOI documents and their partial release (though some sections are redacted under s47F for personal privacy, which is generally acceptable) aligns with the progressive value of governmental transparency and accountability. The ABS's expert advice, highlighting the flaws in the AEC's methodology, demonstrates an internal commitment to statistical rigor, which is positive. However, the fact that such a fundamental flaw in methodology led to a party's deregistration in the first place suggests a failure of robust internal oversight or a predisposition towards administrative convenience over democratic fairness. The FOI process, in this instance, serves as a crucial mechanism for holding the AEC accountable for its processes.\n\nIn summary, the documents reveal government actions that, by relying on a statistically unsound method for party membership verification, created an unfair and arbitrary barrier to political participation. This directly contravenes progressive values of civil liberties, equitable democratic access, and evidence-based governance, potentially stifling the growth of diverse political movements. While the FOI process itself promotes transparency, the underlying administrative flaw points to a need for more rigorous adherence to principles of fairness and statistical validity in electoral oversight."

At that meeting we discussed the ABS \n\nThank you for meeting with \nmethodology for sampling and testing membership of political parties used by the AEC. You kindly reviewed some \nquestions we had and considered some issues raised by applications for review of the decision to deregister \nVoteFlux.Org | Upgrade Democracy! (the Party). The purpose of this email is to summarise the key points raised in \nthat discussion. I would be grateful if you could confirm that I have set out your advice correctly. If not, I would be \ngrateful if you could edit the response or reply clarify any points.  \n\nIf possible, we would be grateful for your response by Monday 1 July 2022. We may provide this information to the \nElectoral Commission for the purposes of their review of the decision to deregister the Party. \n\n1. What conclusions can be drawn in relation to the list of 4680 names in the Party’s list, following the delegate’s \ndecision to test the top 1,650 names of that list (the sub-list)? \n\nWith respect to the test conducted it is not the randomisation or not that is causing the false rejection (or false \nacceptance) rate to land outside the limits. It is the sample size that control the test conditions. If you had \nrandomised you would have been able to say something about the whole list as the final sample (probabilistically) \nwould have referred to the 4680 not just the 1650. Nevertheless you still would have needed a bigger sample size to \nget the desired risk rates.  \n\nYou advised that as the Party’s list was not randomised before the sub-list was made (as only the top 1650 names \nwere selected) it is not possible to draw any meaningful statistical conclusions about the Party’s whole list of 4680 \nfrom the results of testing the sub-list. You can only say something about the selected 1650. This is because, without \nrandomisation there is no chance of the other records being selected. You explained this by the analogy of \nattempting to sample from a deck of cards for aces. Having failed to first shuffle the deck, chunking the bottom half \naway, and then sample from what is left will not give you useful information about all original cards. Those thrown \naway were never in the running. \n\nThe test done indicates a list with low proportion of eligible members among the 1650. \n\nDELETE As would usually be the case, as the test of the sub-list failed, it is possible to conclude (to the level of \nconfidence to which the test is set) that the sub-list of 1,650 did not include 1,500 members.  \n\n2. What are the alternative options for testing the larger list? \n\nYou explained that a larger sample size would be required to test a large list to the same degree of confidence. \nCurrent sampling is calibrated so that the probability of accepting an invalid list is less than 2%, and the probability \nof falsely rejecting a valid list is less than 6%. You estimated that the sample size required to test the full list of 4680 \nnames would be over 300. You also advised that excel spreadsheet calculator provided to the AEC could provide \ninformation about the sample size required to test a list of 4680 names to different levels of confidence.  \n\nWe have now used the calculator (attached), to calculate that sampling a list of 4680 members, where the desired \nprobability of false rejection is 6% and the desired probability of false acceptance is 2%, would require an \napproximate sample size of 564 and a maximum number of denials allowed of 399.     \n\n3. Does filtering names affect the error rates? \n\nYou explained that in your view, the arguments made in \n paper with respect to filtering names increasing \nthe error rate are without foundation. You explained that, provided the filtering process is done in accordance with \nthe ABS methodology, filtering names works in favour of parties by removing from a list members who would not \nhave been capable of meeting the requirements.  \n\nCorrect this would improve the ‘quality’ of the list and decrease the occurrence of finding denials (non-members) in \nthe list sample. \n\n4\n\nsection 47FS 47F\n\n\n--- Page 5 ---\n\n4. Your general comments on \n\n paper \n\n hypothetical example. That example \nYou considered that it was not instructive to consider in depth \nstarted from the premise that the party has more than 1,500 and sought to prove that a specific list could be \nrejected by the sampling methodology.  \n\nYou agreed with the general proposition that if the correct sampling size was not adopted in relation to a larger list, \nthe likelihood of false rejection increased. This is shown by the calculator.  \n\nWe also discussed generally the rationale for requiring a smaller sampling size as a practical and fair method for \ntesting party lists. We discussed the difficulties of testing a larger list.  Since the requirement is minimum 1500 a \nparty with a very large list that is ‘low quality’ in the sense that it contains a high percentage of non-members will \nrequire a very big sample size to control false rejection risks. This relates to the incentives of parties to keep good \nrecords of their members and provide the AEC with a high quality list. Providing large low quality lists should be \ndiscouraged.  \n\nLegal Services Section | Legal & Procurement Branch \nAustralian Electoral Commission \n\nDISCLAIMER: \n\nIf you have received this transmission in error please notify us immediately by return email and delete all copies.
