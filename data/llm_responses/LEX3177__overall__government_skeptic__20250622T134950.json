            "text": "The Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) documents reveal a rigid and potentially arbitrary bureaucratic process for party deregistration, heavily reliant on a single \"ABS testing methodology\" whose underlying fairness and rationality are asserted rather than demonstrated. Despite a specific FOI request for documentation supporting the methodology's \"rational, fair and practical\" nature, the provided papers largely describe its application, not its foundational justification, suggesting a lack of transparency.\n\nThe Seniors United Party of Australia (SUPA), representing an elderly demographic, faced deregistration after two membership list tests failed to meet the 500-member threshold. The AEC's statistical testing methodology, a \"random sample\" phone survey, yielded \"too many denials\" (8/37 and 9/44, respectively) to provide \"statistical confidence.\"\n\nSUPA's application for review highlighted critical demographic challenges: a higher death rate, health issues, prevalent dementia or memory loss among members leading to negative responses, and an understandable fear of phone scammers influencing engagement. The party also noted its severe funding disadvantages, limiting its ability to communicate with members or employ staff, and the lack of scrutineer access during AEC membership testing, a right afforded during elections.\n\nThe AEC's response to these concerns epitomizes bureaucratic inflexibility and a narrow interpretation of rules:\n*   The claims of age-related issues (dementia, scam fears) were dismissed due to a lack of \"evidence\" from the applicant and deemed irrelevant to \"positive or negative response rates.\" This ignores real-world sociological factors and places an undue burden of proof on the party to validate systemic issues.\n*   The AEC explicitly stated that the Electoral Act \"does not provide political parties with any equivalent right of scrutiny\" for membership testing, dismissing a legitimate fairness concern as a mere statutory absence.\n*   The AEC maintained it had \"no discretion\" and could not consider \"policies or demographics\" of a party, insisting on a one-size-fits-all approach that arguably disadvantages niche or demographically specific parties.\n\nRemarkably, after two failed attempts and the outright dismissal of the party's contextual arguments, the AEC allowed a *third* membership list submission. This final test, using the identical \"ABS testing methodology,\" yielded only one denial out of 44 responses, now providing \"statistical confidence\" for the party to be re-registered. This abrupt reversal, following persistent (and largely dismissed) appeals, raises significant questions:\n*   **Waste and Inefficiency:** The process involved multiple rounds of testing, submissions, and internal reviews, consuming significant AEC and party resources, only to result in a re-registration based on a marginal statistical shift.\n*   **Questionable Decision-Making:** The stark difference in outcomes between tests, all using the same \"rational\" methodology, suggests either an inherent inconsistency in the test's reliability or an implicit pressure to eventually find a passing result after extensive administrative effort. It undermines the asserted precision and fairness of the \"statistical confidence\" model.\n*   **Power Abuse/Lack of Accountability:** The AEC's rigid dismissal of the party's unique demographic challenges and fairness arguments, only to ultimately reverse its decision on statistical grounds, indicates a system prioritizing procedural adherence over contextual understanding or adaptive policy, with little apparent accountability for the initial, costly failures.\n\nIn essence, the documents portray an electoral commission that, while adhering to its internal processes, struggles with a critical application of \"fairness\" in diverse contexts, preferring a rigid, statistical model that can lead to inefficient, drawn-out disputes and ultimately, seemingly arbitrary outcomes."

Authority \n\n1.1.  Section 141 of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 (the Electoral Act). \n\n2. Decision under review \n\n2.1.  The decision for review by the Electoral Commission is the decision of the delegate to deregister \nthe Seniors United Party of Australia (the Party) dated 9 March 2021 (the Delegate’s Decision) \n[Attachment A]. \n\n3. Relevant law and the continued 500-member threshold  \n\n3.1.  Unless otherwise indicated, all references to legislative provisions in this Commission Paper are \n\nreferences to the Electoral Act. \n\n3.2.  On 3 September 2021, after the Delegate’s Decision, the Electoral Legislation Amendment (Party \nRegistration Integrity) Act 2021 (the 2021 Amendment Act) amended ss 123, 126, and 137 and \nreplaced s 126 with new s 123A. Amongst other things, the 2021 Amendment Act increased the \nmembership  threshold  for  being  registered  as  a  non-Parliamentary  party  from  ‘at  least  500 \nmembers’ to ‘at least 1,500 members’. \n\n3.3.  Under s 20(3) of the 2021 Amendment Act, that Act’s amendment to the provision in the Electoral \nAct upon which the Delegate’s Decision was based (being s 137(1)(b)) do not come into effect \nuntil 3 December 2021.  \n\n3.4.  Accordingly, this review must be conducted on the basis as to whether the Electoral Commission \nis  satisfied  on  reasonable  grounds  that  the  Party  ‘has  ceased  to  have  at  least  500  members’ \n(emphasis added). \n\nRegister review — s 138A \n\n3.5.  Under  s  138A(1),  the  Electoral  Commission  may  review  the  Register  of  Political  Parties \nestablished and maintained under s 125 (the Register) to determine whether one or more of the \nparties included in the Register: \n\n(a) \n\nis an eligible political party (s 138A(1)(a)); or \n\n(b)  should be deregistered under ss 136 or 137 (s 138A(1)(b)). \n\n3.6.  A review under s138A(1) can be conducted at any time except during an election writ period (s \n\n138A(2)).  \n\n3.7.  For the purposes of a review under s 138A(1), the Electoral Commission may request that the \nregistered  officer  of  a  party  provide  specified  information  regarding  the  party’s  eligibility  to  be \nregistered (s 138A(3)). \n\nDefinitions relevant to eligibility to be registered — ss 123, 123A and 126 \n\n3.8. \n\nImmediately prior to amendments made on 3 September 2021,  s 123(1) provided that: \n\n(a)  an ‘eligible political party’ means a political party that: \n\n(a) \n\neither: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nis a Parliamentary party; or \n\nhas at least 500 members; and \n\n(b) \n\nis established on the basis of a written constitution (however described) that sets \nout the aims of the party; and \n\nAustralian Electoral Commission Meeting | Agenda Item 2 \n\nPage 2\n\n\n--- Page 4 ---\n\nItem 2: Review of the delegate’s decision to deregister the Seniors United Party of Australia \n\n(b)  a ‘Parliamentary party’ means a political party at least one member of which is a member \n\nof the Parliament of the Commonwealth. \n\n3.9.  Under  ss  123(3)  and  126(2A),  and  under  the  succeeding  ss  123(3)  and  123A  that  came  into \neffect on 3 September 2021, members relied on by a party to satisfy the membership requirement \nmust be on the Commonwealth electoral Roll (the Roll) and cannot be relied on by another non-\nParliamentary party for the purpose of qualifying or continuing to qualify as an eligible political \nparty. \n\nDeregistration due to insufficient membership — s 137 \n\n3.10. Under s 137(1)(b) as has been in effect at all relevant times and is still in effect, if the Electoral \nCommission is satisfied on reasonable grounds that a registered non-Parliamentary party has \nceased to have at least 500 members, it must give the registered officer of the party notice, in \nwriting, that it is considering deregistering the party under that section (with reasons and other \nspecified information).  \n\n3.11. Where a notice is given under s 137(1), the registered officer of the party may, within 1 month \nafter the date on which the notice was given, lodge with the Electoral Commission a written and \nsigned statement that sets out reasons why the party should not be deregistered (s 137(2)). \n\n3.12. Where  a  statement  is  lodged  under  s  137(2),  the  Electoral  Commission  shall  consider  that \nstatement and determine whether the political party should be deregistered for the reason set \nout in the s 137(1) notice (s 137(5)). \n\n3.13. Where,  under  s  137(5),  the  Electoral  Commission  determines  that  a  political  party  should  be \n\nderegistered, it shall: \n\n(a)  deregister the party (s 137(6)(a)); and \n\n(b)  give  the  person  who  was  the  last  registered  officer  of  the  party  written  notice  of  the \nderegistration, setting  out  its  reasons  for rejecting the reasons  set  out  in the  statement \nlodged under s 137(2) (s 137(6)(b)). \n\n3.14. The methodology and formula employed by the AEC to test membership lists of 500 individuals \nwas  first  supplied  to  the  AEC  by  the  Australian  Bureau  of  Statistics  (the  ABS)  in  2010  (with \nmodifications  in  2011  and  2017).  It  was  re-endorsed  by  the  Electoral  Commission  in  2017 \n[Attachment  B].  The  Electoral  Commission  has  consistently  found  that,  absent  any  relevant \nfactors to the contrary, a failure to satisfy this test alone  will constitute reasonable grounds on \nwhich it can be satisfied that a political party does not have, or has ceased to have, at least 500 \nmembers. \n\nDelegation of relevant powers \n\n3.15. Under s 16, the Electoral Commission may by resolution delegate to an appointed Commissioner, \nan electoral officer or a member of the staff of the Electoral Commission all or any of its powers \nunder the Electoral Act (other than its powers under Part IV).  \n\n3.16. Under  an  Instrument  of  Delegation  executed  on  29  March  2019,  the  relevant  powers  of  the \nElectoral  Commission  set  out  in  ss  137,  138 and 138A  have  been  delegated  to  the  Assistant \nCommissioner, Disclosure, Assurance and Engagement Branch. \n\nInternal review of a delegate’s deregistration decision  \n\n3.17. Under  s  141(1),  a decision  of  a delegate of the Electoral  Commission to  deregister  a political \n\nparty under s 137(6) is a ‘reviewable decision’. \n\n3.18. Under s 141(2), a person affected by a reviewable decision of a delegate who is dissatisfied with \n\nthe decision may make an application for review of that decision by the Electoral Commission. \n\n3.19. An application under s 141(2): \n\n•  must be made within the period of 28 days after the day on which the decision first comes \n\nAustralian Electoral Commission Meeting | Agenda Item 2 \n\nPage 3\n\n\n--- Page 5 ---\n\nItem 2: Review of the delegate’s decision to deregister the Seniors United Party of Australia \n\nto  the  notice  of  the  person,  or  within  such  further  period  as  the  Electoral  Commission \n(either before or after the expiration of that period) allows; \n\n•  must be made in writing to the Electoral Commission;  \n\n•  must specify an address of the applicant; and  \n\n•  must include reasons for making the application (s 141(3)).  \n\n3.20. Under s 141(4), upon receipt of an application for review, the Electoral Commission must review \n\nthe delegate’s decision and either: \n\n(a)  affirm the decision; \n\n(b)  vary the decision; or  \n\n(c)  set aside the decision and make a decision in substitution. \n\n3.21. In Shi v Migration Agents Registration Authority [2008] HCA 31 (Shi), the High Court of Australia \nheld that, when reviewing a decision to cancel a migration agent’s registration, the Administrative \nAppeals Tribunal (the AAT) was entitled to consider all evidence available to the AAT as at the \ntime of the AAT’s review, including relevant actions taken by an agent after the decision under \nreview.  \n\n3.22. In John Mulholland and Australian Electoral Commission and Anthony Zegenhagen [2011] AATA \n717, the AAT considered Shi and accepted that the review should be based on the latest material \n(and made as at the latest point of time available) unless there is a contrary requirement in the \nlegislation under which the decision is being made. \n\n3.23. Like the AAT in Shi, the Electoral Commission can consider all evidence available to the Electoral \nCommission as at the time of the Electoral Commission’s review. It is therefore submitted that \nthe Electoral Commission should consider the reasoning applied in Shi to be highly persuasive \nin a review under s141(2), and consider itself empowered to request and consider information \nthat has been provided by the applicant subsequent to the Delegate’s Decision.  \n\n4. Review of Register  \n\nRequest for membership list \n\n4.1.  On 20 August 2020, pursuant to a review of the Register under s 138A(1), the AEC issued a \nnotice  to  the  registered  officer  of  the  Party, \n,  under  s  138A(3)  of  the \nElectoral Act (the Notice) [Attachment C]. The Notice requested that the Party provide the AEC \nwith a membership list of between 500 and 550 members, in electronic format, in order for the \nAEC to determine the Party’s eligibility to remain registered. \n\n4.2.  On 8 October 2020, the registered officer responded to the Notice, providing with it the requested \n\ndocumentation, including a membership list (the October 2020 List) [Attachment D]. \n\nSuspension of processing \n\n4.3.  On  26  October  2020,  a  writ  for  a  by-election  for  the  federal  electoral  division  of  Groom  (the \n\nGroom by-election) was issued.  \n\n4.4.  Under s 138A(2), the Electoral Commission may not review the Register to determine whether a \n\nparty should be deregistered during an election writ period. \n\n4.5.  Similarly, under s 127, during an election writ period, no action is permitted to be taken in relation \nto any application for the registration of a political party. This is taken to include any deregistration \nproceedings.  \n\n4.6.  On 26 October 2020, The AEC sent correspondence to the registered officer of the Party advising \n\nof the suspension of processing [Attachment E].  \n\nAustralian Electoral Commission Meeting | Agenda Item 2 \n\nPage 4 \n\nOut of scope\n\n\n--- Page 6 ---\n\nItem 2: Review of the delegate’s decision to deregister the Seniors United Party of Australia \n\nResumption of processing \n\n4.7.  On  2  December  2020,  the  writ  for  the  Groom  by-election  was  returned.  The  AEC  sent \ncorrespondence to the registered officer of the Party advising that processing could recommence, \ninviting the Party to provide an updated membership list, and notifying the Party that the deadline \nby which they must reply to the Notice had been extended to 18 January 2021 [Attachment F]. \n\n4.8.  On 7 December 2020, the registered officer of the Party confirmed that the AEC could continue \n\ntesting the October 2020 List [Attachment G]. \n\n5. Assessment of October 2020 membership list \n\nTesting of the October 2020 List \n\n5.1.  Between 9 October 2020 and 17 December 2020, the AEC conducted membership testing to \ndetermine  how  many  of  the  individuals  contained  in  the  October  2020  List  satisfied  the \nrequirements of ss 123(3) and 126(2A) as in effect at the time: \n\n(a)  On 9 October 2020, the AEC automatically checked the October 2020 List against the Roll \nusing the AEC’s Roll Management System (RMANS). This identified that 458 of the 549 \nindividuals named in the list were electors on the Roll. \n\n(b)  The  AEC  manually  checked  the  October  2020  List  against  the  Roll  using  the  AEC’s \nGeneral Enrolment Election Support and Information System (GENESIS). As a result, an \nadditional 71 of the individuals named in the list were identified as being electors, while \nsix were not enrolled or were unable to be matched to the Roll, and 14 were deceased. \nThis resulted in the identification of 529 claimed members. \n\n(c)  The AEC uploaded the list of 529 names to the AEC’s Funding And Disclosure Client & \nReturn  Management  (FCRM)  system.  This  resulted  in  the  identification  of  525  claimed \nmembers as four of the individuals named were identified as duplicates within the list. \n\n(d)  The ABS testing methodology (mentioned above at paragraph 3.13) recommends that in \ntesting  a  list  of  525  the  AEC  should  obtain  confirmation  from  a  random  sample  of  37 \nindividuals  [Attachment  H].  If  more  than  three  of  the  37  individuals  were  to  deny \nmembership,  there  would  be  insufficient  statistical  confidence  in  the  number  of  total \nmembers in the list being at least 500. \n\n(e)  Using the randomising functionality in Microsoft Excel, AEC staff identified a sample size \nof 74 individuals from the 525 names in list. Individuals from this sample were contacted \nbetween  7  December  2020  and  16  December  2020  and  asked  if  they  were  current \nmembers  of  the  Party  [Attachment  I].  Of  the  59  individuals  contacted  to  obtain  the \nrequired 37 responses: \n\n• \n\n• \n\n• \n\n22 provided a neutral response or were not contactable; \n\n29 confirmed being members of the Party; and \n\neight denied being members of the Party. \n\nDelegate’s determination and s 137 Notice \n\n5.2. \n\nIn accordance with the ABS testing methodology, eight denials out of 37 responses exceeded \nthe three denials permitted to provide statistical confidence that the Party’s list had at least 500 \nmembers. \n\n5.3.  On that basis, on 11 January 2021, the delegate of the Electoral Commission determined that \nthe Party had failed to satisfy the requirements of s 123(1)(a)(ii), and should be considered for \nderegistration under s 137(1)(b) [Attachment J]. \n\nAustralian Electoral Commission Meeting | Agenda Item 2 \n\nPage 5\n\n\n--- Page 7 ---\n\nItem 2: Review of the delegate’s decision to deregister the Seniors United Party of Australia \n\n5.4.  On 12 January 2021, the delegate of the Electoral Commission gave a notice to the registered \nofficer  of  the  Party  under  s  137(1)  (the  s  137  Notice)  that  the  Electoral  Commission  was \nconsidering deregistering the Party as it was satisfied on reasonable grounds that the Party has \nceased to have at least 500 members. \n\n6. Assessment of February 2021 membership list \n\nParty response to s 137 Notice  \n\n6.1.  On  3  February  2021,  the  Party  responded  to  the  s  137  Notice,  providing  a  statement  in \naccordance with s 137(2) and a second membership list of between 500 and 550 members in \nelectronic form (the February 2021 List) [Attachment K]. \n\nTesting of the February 2021 List \n\n6.2.  Between  3  February  2021  and 24  February  2021,  the  AEC  conducted membership  testing  to \ndetermine  how  many  of  the  individuals  contained  in  the  February  2021  List  satisfied  the \nrequirements of ss 123(3) and 126(2A): \n\n(a)  On 3 February 2021, the AEC automatically checked the February 2021 List against the \nRoll using RMANS. This identified that 474 of the 550 individuals named in the list were \nelectors on the Roll. \n\n(b)  The AEC manually checked the February 2021 List against the Roll using GENESIS. As \na  result,  an  additional  70  of  the  individuals  named  in  the  list  were  identified  as  being \nelectors, while one was not enrolled to vote or unable to be matched to the Roll, and five \nwere deceased. This resulted in the identification of 544 claimed members. \n\n(c)  The  AEC  uploaded  the  list  of  544  names  to  the  FCRM  system.  This  resulted  in  the \nidentification of 539 claimed members, as four of the individuals named were identified as \nduplicates within the list and one was identified as supporting the registration of another \nparty. \n\n(d)  The ABS testing methodology (mentioned above at paragraph 1.14) recommends that in \ntesting  a  list  of  539  the  AEC  should  obtain  confirmation  from  a  random  sample  of  44 \nindividuals  [Attachment  L].  If  more  than  five  of  the  44  individuals  were  to  deny \nmembership,  there  would  be  insufficient  statistical  confidence  in  the  number  of  total \nmembers in the list being at least 500. \n\n(e)  Using the randomising functionality in Microsoft Excel, AEC staff identified a sample size \nof 88 individuals from the 539 names in list. Individuals from this sample were contacted \nbetween 12 March 2021 and 19 March 2021 and asked if they were current members of \nthe  Party  [Attachment  M].  Of  the  64  individuals  contacted  to  obtain  the  required  44 \nresponses: \n\n• \n\n• \n\n• \n\n20 provided a neutral response or were not contactable; \n\n35 confirmed being members of the Party; and \n\nnine denied being members of the Party.  \n\nDelegate’s determination under s 137(5) \n\n6.3. \n\nIn accordance with the ABS testing methodology, nine denials out of 44 responses exceeded the \nfive  denials  permitted  to  provide  statistical  confidence  that  the  Party’s  list  had  at  least  500 \nmembers. \n\n6.4.  On 9 March 2021, the delegate of the Electoral Commission determined under s 137(5) that the \nParty had failed to satisfy the requirements of s 123(1)(a)(ii), and should be deregistered on the \nbasis that it had ceased to have at least 500 members [Attachment A]. \n\nAustralian Electoral Commission Meeting | Agenda Item 2 \n\nPage 6\n\n\n--- Page 8 ---\n\nItem 2: Review of the delegate’s decision to deregister the Seniors United Party of Australia \n\n6.5.  On  10 March  2021, the delegate  of the  Electoral  Commission  gave  a notice  to  the  registered \nofficer of the Party under s 137(6) (the Deregistration Notice) of her determination that the Party \nbe deregistered on the grounds that it had ceased to have at least 500 members.  \n\n7. Application for review of Delegate’s Decision \n\nApplication for review from \n\n7.1.  On  21  March  2021, \n\n  submitted  an  application  to  the  Electoral  Commission \nunder  s  141(2)  of  the  Electoral  Act  by  email,  requesting  review  of  the  Delegate’s  Decision \n[Attachment N].  \n\n7.2.  On  22  March  2021,  the  Commission  Secretariat  acknowledged  receipt  of \n\napplication by email [Attachment O]. \n\n7.3.  On 25 March 2021, \n\n submitted further material in support of his reasons for making \n\nhis internal review application [Attachment P]. \n\n7.4.  On 7 July 2021 at 11.09am, the Commission Secretariat emailed \n\n to invite \n\nto submit an updated membership list on or before 30 July 2021 [Attachment R]. \n\n7.5.  On 7 July 2021 at 3.05pm, \n\n emailed the Commission Secretariat to acknowledge the \n\ninvitation for an updated membership list [Attachment S]. \n\nExtensions given \n\n due to Greater Sydney COVID-19 lockdown  \n\n7.6.  On  15  July  2021, \n\n  emailed  the  Commission  Secretariat  to  request  a  two-week \nextension  on  the  30  July  2021  deadline,  on  account  of  the  COVID019  lockdown  in  Greater \nSydney preventing his access to the Roll at local AEC offices [Attachment T]. \n\n7.7.

The  term  ‘person  affected’  is  not  defined  within  the  Electoral  Act,  nor  has  the  term  received \n\njudicial consideration within the context of electoral law. \n\n8.3. \n\n8.4.  This advice and its conclusions support the view that the broad public interest in decisions under \nPart XI does not create an automatic right of standing for all electors.

On 28 May 2021, the AEC received correspondence addressed from \n\nvia post, which \n\ncontained a Change Registered Officer form dated 18 May 2021 and signed by \n\n to change the registered officer of the Party from \n\n to \n\n[Attachment  ZS].

Taking  this  information  on  its  face,  AEC  Legal  Services  is  of  the  view  that \nspecial interest in the matter and can be considered a ‘person affected’ by it.  \n\nadvised \n\n  has  a \n\nReasons given by applicant regarding testing of October 2020 and February 2021 Lists \n\n8.10. In his reasons for making an internal review application given on 21 March 2021 and 25 March \n submitted that the AEC’s membership testing methodology was not a ‘true and \n\n2021, \nfair’ method of testing in respect of the Party.  \n\n8.11. The following is a summary of the matters \n\nsubmitted for the Electoral Commission’s \n\nconsideration: \n\n(a)  The Party membership is comprised mainly of elderly members, and has a higher death \nrate than other political parties, resulting in a higher turnover or ‘attrition’ of its membership. \n\n(b)  The Party membership incurs a higher incidence of health issues (including terminal / end \n\nof life issues) that prevent its members from participating. \n\n(c)  The Party membership incurs a much higher rate of ‘dementia, or loss of memory’, which \nprevents members recalling that they are members when the AEC calls, causing members \nto answer negatively to membership questions. \n\n(d)  The elderly are increasingly concerned with phone scammers, particularly people imitating \ngovernment employees on the phone, causing them to refuse to respond to questioning, \nor  even  to  answering  the  phone  to  unknown  numbers.  They  are  much  more  likely  to \nrespond with a “No” to any question put to them over a phone. \n\n(e)  The finding by the AEC that four duplications existed on both the October 2020 List and \nFebruary  2021  List,  and  five  deceased  individuals  existed  on  the  February  2021  List, \ndespite \npersonally purging the list after the failure of the October 2020 List, \nsuggests that the AEC made an error in its assessment. \n\nAustralian Electoral Commission Meeting | Agenda Item 2 \n\nPage 9 \n\nOut of scopeOut of scopeOut of scopeOut of scopeOut of scopeOut of scopeOut of scopeOut of scopeOut of scopeOut of scopeOut of scopeOut of scopes 42Out of scope\n\n\n--- Page 11 ---\n\nItem 2: Review of the delegate’s decision to deregister the Seniors United Party of Australia \n\n(f) \n\nIf the figures for duplications and deaths in the February 2021 List were removed, the list \nwould be much closer to passing, and the remaining denials could have been substituted \nfor other members by the Party. \n\n(g)  Whereas political parties can have scrutineers on polling day, the fact that scrutineers are \nnot  allowed  during  membership  testing  amounts  to  procedural  unfairness  against  the \nParty. \n\n(h)  The Party represents a demographic for which no other political party provides specialist \n\nrepresentation. There is a public interest in permitting its continued registration. \n\n(i)  The Party’s ability to attract donations is significantly lower than that of other parties as its \ndonations are not tax-deductible. The Party has no other source of funding, and it therefore \nis  at  a  disadvantage  in  conducting  its  affairs,  including  in  respect  of  communicating, \nadvertising and employing officers. \n\n(j)  As  the  Party’s  members  are  mostly  pensioners  or  part-pensioners,  the  Party  is  at  a \ndisadvantage  in  finding  appropriate  individuals  who  can  afford  to  be  candidates  at \nelections. \n\nConsideration of reasons given by applicant \n\n8.12. In  respect  of  reason  (a),  it  would  seem  a  logical  conclusion  that  a  party  with  an  elderly \nmembership base is more likely than some other parties to see members removed from the Roll \n(due to death, or objection under s 114(1A)) in the course of the registration or review process. \nHowever, this would seem to only (potentially) affect the sample size that the AEC tests (and the \nassociated number of denials permitted). It would not follow that it would affect the rate of denials. \nNeither of the membership lists tested by the AEC fell below the minimum of 500 names due to \nthose names not appearing on the Roll.  \n\n8.13. In  respect  of  reason  (b),  the  ability  of  members  to  participate  in  the  affairs  of  the  Party  (e.g. \nresponding to AEC contact) would not seem to have any bearing on positive or negative response \nrates,  only  neutral  response  (non-response)  rates,  which  do  not  affect  the  outcome  of \nmembership testing. \n\n8.14. In respect of reasons (c) and (d), the applicant does not offer any evidence in support of these \nassertions. There is no evidence or information before the Electoral Commission to indicate that \nthese assertions are true (i.e. that the relevant individual would reply in the negative instead of \nproviding a neutral answer).  \n\n(a)  The AEC’s Party Registration Guide has made clear at all relevant times that a person \nwhose  name  is  included  on  a  party’s  membership  list  must  formally  acknowledge \nmembership of the party when contacted by the AEC. \n\n(b)  Section 123 (immediately before and after the 2021 Amending Act) contemplates neither \nthe attribution of membership of a political party upon unwilling individuals, nor an analysis \nof the motivations or reasons of individuals who deny membership of a political party.  \n\n(c)  The Electoral Commission has previously found that the confirmations and denials made \nto  AEC  officers \nformal \nacknowledgments required to test membership, and the testing methodology applied by \nthe AEC is consistent with the Electoral Act.  \n\nthe  process  of  membership \n\ntesting  constitute \n\nthe \n\nin \n\n8.15. In respect of reason (e), the Parliamentary Engagement and Party Registration Section (PEPRS) \nof the AEC has reviewed its records of the testing of the October 2020 List and February 2021 \nList and has found no error in its assessment [Attachment ZU] \n\n(a)  Two of the duplicates in the October 2020 List appear again in the February 2021 List. \nThe  remaining  two  duplicates  in  the  October  2020  List  were  omitted,  but  two  new \nduplicates appeared in the February 2021 List. This suggests that\n successfully \nidentified and removed two of the duplicates from the October 2020 List, but replaced them \nwith two new duplicates. \n\nAustralian Electoral Commission Meeting | Agenda Item 2 \n\nPage 10 \n\nOut of scope\n\n\n--- Page 12 ---\n\nItem 2: Review of the delegate’s decision to deregister the Seniors United Party of Australia \n\n(b)  Of the 14 deceased individuals in the October 2020 List, four of those individuals appear \namong  the  five  deceased  individuals  in  the  February  2021  List.  This  suggests  that \n\nsuccessfully  identified  and  removed  10  of  the  deceased  individuals  from  the \nOctober  2020  List.  PEPRS  identified  that  the  fifth  deceased  individual  on  the  February \n2021 List died in December 2020 (i.e. in the period between the testing of each list).  \n\n8.16. In  respect  of  reason  (f), \n\n  appears  to  misunderstand  elements  of  the  membership \ntesting methodology. Duplicated and deceased members are not counted as negative responses \n(denials). The removal of these individuals from a membership list would only lead to a potential \nreduction in the testing sample size. A reduction in sample size does usually reduce the absolute \nnumber  of  permitted  denials  by  a  roughly  proportional  amount.  However,  as  duplicates  and \ndeceased electors are not eligible under the Electoral Act to be members on which a party can \nrely, it is in fact beneficial to parties that they be removed from the membership list by the AEC \ninstead of being counted as negative responses. \n\n8.17. In respect of reasons (g) to (j), these matters are not relevant to the issue of whether the Party \n\nhas ceased to have 500 members.  \n\n(a)  Nominated candidates in an election have a statutory right to appoint scrutineers for polling \nday under s 217, and those scrutineers have an statutory right to attend a polling booth on \npolling  day  under  s  218.  The  Electoral  Act  does  not  provide  political  parties  with  any \nequivalent right of scrutiny in the Electoral Commission’s decision-making process under \nss 137(1) or 137(5). \n\n(b)  The  500-member  requirement  for  registration  is  a  statutory  one.  Where  the  Electoral \nCommission  is  satisfied  on  reasonable  grounds  that  a  party  has  ceased  to  have  500 \nmembers,  it  must  deregister  the  party  (s  137(6)(a)).  The  Electoral  Commission  has  no \ndiscretion once it is satisfied of this fact on reasonable grounds.  \n\n(c) \n\nIn  any  case,  in  the  interests  of  political  neutrality  it  would  not  be  appropriate  for  the \nElectoral Commission to take into account the policies or demographics of a political party \nin the assessment of its eligibility for registration, or to apply different membership tests to \ndifferent parties. \n\nTesting of September 2021 List \n\n8.18. Between 28 September 2021 and 19 October 2021, the AEC conducted membership testing to \ndetermine  how  many  of  the  individuals  contained  in  the  September  2021  List  satisfied  the \nrequirements of ss 123(3) and 123A: \n\n(a)  On 28 September 2021, the AEC automatically checked the September 2021 List against \nthe  Roll  using  RMANS. This  identified  that  473 of  the  550  individuals  named  in the  list \nwere electors on the Roll. \n\n(b)  On 29 September 2021, the AEC manually checked the September 2021 List against the \nRoll using GENESIS. As a result, an additional 69 of the individuals named in the list were \nidentified as being electors, while five were not enrolled to vote or unable to be matched \nto the  Roll,  and three  were  deceased.  This resulted  in the  identification of  542  claimed \nmembers on the Roll. \n\n(c)  On 8 October 2021, the AEC uploaded the list of 542 names to the FCRM system. This \nresulted  in the  identification  of  538  claimed  members,  as four  of the  individuals  named \nwere identified as supporting the registration of another party [Attachment ZV].  \n\n(d)  The ABS testing methodology recommends that in testing a list of 538 the AEC should \nobtain  confirmation  from  a random  sample  of  44  individuals  [Attachment  ZW].  If  more \nthan  five  of  the  44  individuals  were  to  deny  membership,  there  would  be  insufficient \nstatistical confidence in the number of total members in the list being at least 500. \n\n(e)  On  8  October  2021,  using  the  randomising  functionality  in  Microsoft  Excel,  AEC  staff \nidentified a sample size of 88 individuals from the 539 names in list. Individuals from this \n\nAustralian Electoral Commission Meeting | Agenda Item 2 \n\nPage 11 \n\nOut of sOut of scope\n\n\n--- Page 13 ---\n\nItem 2: Review of the delegate’s decision to deregister the Seniors United Party of Australia \n\nsample were contacted between 15 October 2021 and 19 October 2021 and asked if they \nwere current members of the Party [Attachment ZX]. Of the 57 individuals contacted to \nobtain the required 44 responses: \n\n• \n\n• \n\n• \n\n• \n\nConclusions \n\nnine provided a neutral response or were not contactable; \n\n43 confirmed being members of the Party; \n\none denied being a member of the Party; and \n\na further four members of the party responded to the AEC after the conclusion \nof the membership test. \n\n8.19. In  accordance  with  the  ABS  testing  methodology,  one  denial  out  of  44  responses  provides \nstatistical  confidence  that  the  Party’s  September  2021  list  has  at  least  500  members \n[Attachment ZY]. \n\n8.20. Based on the membership testing of the September 2021 List, despite the consideration above \nof the applicant’s reasons for making an internal review application, the AEC is of the view that it \nis open to the Electoral Commission: \n\n(a)  not to be satisfied on reasonable grounds that the Party has ceased to have 500 members; \n\nand \n\n(b) \n\nto set aside the decision of the delegate of 9 March 2021 to deregister the Party under       \ns 137(6), and substitute a decision to re-register the Party.  \n\nAustralian Electoral Commission Meeting | Agenda Item 2 \n\nPage 12\n\n\n--- Page 14 ---\n\nItem 2: Review of the delegate’s decision to deregister the Seniors United Party of Australia \n\n9.

\n\nDear Mr Rogers, \n\nMy name is \nand dissatisfied with, the decision by the Australian Electoral Commission to deregister the Seniors \nUnited Party of Australia, ( SUPA).  \n\nand I am the applicant for this review. I am a person affected by, \n\nconsider the reasons below which I feel give a strong argument for the AEC to set aside the decision \nunder review and make a decision in substitution for the decision set aside. That is, to reregister the \nparty. \n\n I ask you to please \n\nThe reasons I feel the AEC should consider are:- \n\nDEMOGRAPHIC  REASONS \n\nBecause of the demographic which the party attempts to represent, that is over 60 years of age, our \nmainly elderly membership suffers a higher than normal attrition rate to other political parties. \n\nSUPA’s high loss of members is due to:- \n\n1.   A much higher death rate than in other political parties, as well as long lasting terminal \n      health issues of members that would stop the aged from participating as a member. \n\n2.   A much higher rate of dementia, or loss of memory, which prevents members recalling that \n      they are members when the AEC calls. This would be a considerable cause for members to \n      answer negatively to membership questions by the AEC representative. ( \n\nOut of scopeOut of scopeOut of scopeOut of scopeOut of scopeOut of scope\n\n\n--- Page 3 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 4 ---\n\nunderstand, of its fear of losing the approximately $1million dollars it receives from the NSW State \ngovernment. Then we have the National Seniors which appears to have agreements with \ncommercial interests. Possibly the best is the Council for the Ageing (COTA) which appears to be \nthe best, but is getting little recognition from the press. \n\nNow it has been suggested there are ten lobbyists for every  parliamentarian in Federal parliament. \nLobbyists that are paid huge amounts and which have huge amounts to advertise to influence public \nopinion in their favour, which can oppose the needs of the elderly, or place the needs of the elderly \nsecondary to making profits. \n\nSUPA is needed to help the Federal government continually see that the requirements of the Aged \nare not being met, and advise the Federal government without a conflict of interest. \n\nREQUEST \n\nConsidering the reasons I have given, including the far higher natural attrition rate of our elderly \nmembers, which the vast majority are, their greater chance of lose of memory, and there \nunwillingness to answer “yes “to questions by strangers  over the phone,   and also the fact that \nSUPA alone represents such a large demographic in Australia’s population, I respectfully ask the \nAEC to please consider these reasons and set aside the failed decision and substitute it with a \npass decision. \n\nThanking you for this review. \n\nADDENDUM \n\nI would suggest that under the present test for registration any party representing the Aged with \nmembers mainly in that demographic would more than likely fail the registration test. I believe even \nmajor political parties could possibly fail the test. \n\nYours Faithfully, \n\nOut of scope\n\n\n\n--- Page 1 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 2 ---\n\n25th March 2021 \n\nCommission Secretariat \nAustralian Electoral Commissioner, \nLocked Bag 4007, \nCANBERRA \nACT 2601 \ncommission.secretariat@aec.gov.au \nAEC 02 6271 4552 \n\nRequest to provide further material in support of reasons  already supplied for \nmaking an Application for Internal Review \n\n of decision to Deregister \n\nthe SENIORS UNITED PARTY OF AUSTRALIA \n\nunder s 141(2) of the Electoral Act \n\nDear Sir / Madam, \n\nI have given the following details in my Application for a Review which has already been received \nby the Australian Electoral Commission. \n\n and I am the applicant for this review. I am a person affected   \nMy name is \nby, and dissatisfied with, the decision by the Australian Electoral Commission to deregister the \n Seniors United Party of Australia, ( SUPA).  \n\nconsider the reasons below which I feel give a strong argument for the AEC to set aside the \ndecision under review and make a decision in substitution for the decision set aside. That is, to \n reregister the party. \n\n I ask you to please \n\nThe two reasons I wish to add for the AEC to consider are:- \n\nOTHER DEMOGRAPHIC  REASONS \n\nBecause of the demographic which the party attempts to represent, that is over 60 years of age, our \nmainly elderly membership is largely made up of aged pensioners, or part pensions. \n\n4.  Being a pensioner, or part pensioner usually implies that you pay no income tax. Paying no \n      income tax means that any donation given to the Seniors United party by party members \n      who are pensioners can not be claimed on income tax because they have no income tax to \n\nOut of scopeOut of scopeOut of scopeOut of scope\n\n\n--- Page 3 ---\n\npay. The result of this is that the party’s income from donations is sharply reduced compared to \n     most, if not every other political party  (There is no other funding besides donations). This lack \n     of funds is a hug disadvantage for the party as there is little to no funds for communicating by \n     mail to many members let alone advertising, and there is no possibility of employing people to \n     carry what might be regarded as office work. \n\n     Other parties, especially the major parties receive many large donations most of which would be \n      claimed back through tax by the donor. \n\n5.  An additional disadvantage of having a large part of the membership being pensioners or part \n     pensioners is that they individually normally do not have financial funds to be able to afford \n     to be political candidates at elections hence there are difficulties finding candidates with life \n     experiences of being a pensioner in a financial position to stand as a candidate \n\nREQUEST \n\nI wish these two additional reasons please be be included with the initial reasons and   I \nrespectfully ask the AEC Commission to please consider all my reasons and set aside the failed \ndecision for the Seniors United Party of Australia and substitute it with a pass decision. \n\nThanking you for this review. \n\nYours Faithfully, \n\nOut of scope\n\n\n\n--- Page 1 ---\n\nCross party Duplicates\n\nParty 1\nSeniors United Party of \nAustralia\nSeniors United Party of \nAustralia\nSeniors United Party of \nAustralia\nSeniors United Party of \nAustralia\n\nParty 3\n\nParty 4\n\nParty 2\nAustralian Federation \nParty\nAustralian People's \nParty\n\nLove Australia or Leave Party\n\nThe Great Australian Party\n\nInner party Duplicates\n\nUnder 18 Years Old - at 08/10/2021\n\nO  Out of scopeOut of scopeOut of scopeOut of scope\n\n\n\n--- Page 1 ---\n\nTable supplied by ABS showing confidences in membership testing\n(lists from 500-550)\n\nMembers Lodged\n500\n501\n502\n503\n504\n505\n506\n507\n508\n509\n510\n511\n512\n513\n514\n515\n516\n517\n518\n519\n520\n521\n522\n523\n524\n525\n526\n527\n528\n529\n530\n531\n532\n533\n534\n535\n536\n537\n538\n539\n540\n541\n542\n543\n544\n545\n546\n547\n548\n549\n550\n\nRandom sample \n18\n18\n18\n26\n26\n26\n26\n26\n26\n26\n26\n32\n32\n32\n32\n32\n32\n32\n32\n37\n37\n37\n37\n37\n37\n37\n41\n41\n41\n41\n41\n41\n41\n41\n44\n44\n44\n44\n44\n44\n44\n47\n47\n47\n47\n47\n47\n47\n50\n50\n50\n\nMax denials to pass\n0\n0\n0\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n3\n3\n3\n3\n3\n3\n3\n4\n4\n4\n4\n4\n4\n4\n4\n5\n5\n5\n5\n5\n5\n5\n6\n6\n6\n6\n6\n6\n6\n7\n7\n7\n\nUpdated by ABS November 2016\n\n\n\n--- Page 1 ---\n\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 1 ---\n\n\n\nProvide only the markdown formatted summary text.
