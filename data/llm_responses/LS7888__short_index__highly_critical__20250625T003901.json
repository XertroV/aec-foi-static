  "prompt": "With a highly critical view, provide a concise single-paragraph summary in markdown format of the following FOI request overview:\n\nSummary:\n\nThe provided FOI documents paint a damning picture of the Australian Electoral Commission's (AEC) approach to its Indigenous Electoral Participation Program (IEPP), revealing a disturbing emphasis on statistical optics over genuine achievement, persistent incompetence in data management, and a shocking lack of transparency.\n\n**1. A Catalyst of Crisis and Political Pressure, Not Proactive Design:**\nThe \"new methodology\" was not a proactive innovation but a reactive scramble. Previous Indigenous enrolment rates were \"alarmingly low\" (Doc 26, 29, 6, 8) – a long-standing failure that the AEC seemingly tolerated for years. The sudden urgency in early 2019, epitomised by the Deputy Electoral Commissioner's demand for data within \"2-3 business days\" for the \"Finance Minister’s Office\" (Doc 28), indicates a methodology driven by political expediency and a need to present more favourable numbers to ministers, rather than a commitment to robust, ground-up program improvement. The \"Estimates Brief – Hot Issue\" (Doc 20) explicitly frames the new methodology around showing an \"overall increase on previous estimates,\" highlighting a focus on PR rather than effective enrolment.\n\n**2. Progress Reports: A Litany of Delays, Errors, and Excuses:**\nThe \"progress\" documented is less about systemic improvement and more about internal struggles with data. Emails reveal a messy, reactive process:\n*   **Data Quality Calamity:** From the outset, in March 2018, the AEC grappled with \"Indigenous data\" from Centrelink, needing to \"do something additional/special with the BDM data to establish eligibility\" and \"rerunning the data against the deceased persons file\" (Doc 4). This suggests foundational data was inherently flawed, casting doubt on any subsequent \"improvements.\"\n*   **\"Courageous Assumptions\" and Shaky Foundations:** Despite being touted as \"improved,\" the new methodology is openly admitted to be \"subject to quite courageous assumptions\" and its \"figures should nevertheless still be regarded as indicative only\" (Doc 26, 29, 6, 8). This is an astonishing confession of unreliability, demonstrating a willingness to present highly qualified and potentially inaccurate data as \"progress.\" The shift from \"regression models\" that \"did not fit the data particularly well\" and yielded \"alarmingly low\" rates (Doc 26, 29, 6, 8) to Centrelink data appears less like a methodological advance and more like a desperate search for data that would produce politically palatable figures.\n*   **Last-Minute Corrections and Downplaying Failure:** In September 2019, just before a report was due, a \"problem!\" was discovered in the numbers, requiring a last-minute fix (Doc 37). This indicates a rushed, error-prone analytical process. Furthermore, when an 11% *increase* in the unenrolled Indigenous population in NSW was flagged, AEC staff immediately moved to dismiss it as \"not statistically significant\" and within \"estimation error\" (Doc 40). This reveals a culture of deflecting responsibility and downplaying negative outcomes when faced with inconvenient truths.\n\n**3. Tracking Implementation: Obscurity and Lack of Meaningful Comparison:**\nThe documents offer no clear, consistent tracking of the *implementation* of the IEPP itself, only the *measurement* of enrolment rates using the new (flawed) methodology. There is no evidence of a rigorous comparison of the *effectiveness* of the new IEPP strategy against prior programs, only a comparison of *measurement methodologies* designed to produce higher enrolment estimates. The \"enrolment stimulation event\" in Feb/Mar 2019 resulted in a paltry 2,646 Indigenous enrolments from an identified 72,451 \"potentially unenrolled\" individuals (Doc 26, 29) – a woefully inadequate 3.6% conversion rate, indicating program failure.\n\n**4. Final Summary Reports: Spin Over Substance:**\nThe final summary reports are characterised by vague positive language that masks minimal impact and concerning trends. While the national Indigenous enrolment rate \"increased\" from 76.4% to 76.6% (Doc 41) – a statistically insignificant 0.2% rise – the estimated *unenrolled* Indigenous population *grew* nationally by 1.6% (Doc 40). The claimed \"upward trend\" (Doc 40) is based on a marginal improvement, and in key states like NSW, the unenrolled Indigenous population surged by a worrying 10.9% (Doc 40). The reports highlight generic \"strategies\" and \"targeted activities\" (Doc 41) but provide no concrete evidence of their efficacy under the \"new methodology.\"\n\n**5. Indigenous Involvement: A Void of Accountability:**\nDespite the FOI request explicitly asking for \"the number of Indigenous people involved by the AEC in the planning, design and implementation,\" *no documentation whatsoever* on this critical aspect was provided. This egregious omission suggests either a complete failure to genuinely involve Indigenous communities in a program ostensibly for their benefit, or a deliberate cover-up of minimal or tokenistic engagement, revealing a profound lack of respect and accountability.\n\n**6. Cost and Staffing: Complete Stonewalling:**\nSimilarly, the request for \"final cost of the design, testing and implementation\" and \"details of the number of AEC staffers assigned to the task\" was met with absolute silence. The absence of any financial or staffing data is a clear sign of systemic transparency failure, preventing any assessment of cost-effectiveness or resource allocation. It raises immediate suspicions of mismanagement or a deliberate attempt to hide inflated costs or insufficient resourcing for a program that has demonstrably failed to make a significant impact.\n\nIn conclusion, these documents reveal an AEC that prioritised the cosmetic improvement of statistics over tangible results, employed methodologically unsound processes to achieve those figures, and actively suppressed critical information regarding Indigenous involvement, costs, and staffing. It is a portrait of an agency marked by incompetence, a lack of transparency, and a disinterest in genuine, measurable progress for Indigenous electoral participation.\n\nProvide only the markdown formatted summary text. Do not include any conversational filler or preamble.\n"
