The commentary frequently criticised the Australian Electoral Commission's (AEC) perceived inaction or lack of authority/willingness to address the issue, often citing a 2019 \"purple signs\" incident as an example of \"corruption.\" The social media traffic was substantial and predominantly negative before quickly subsiding.\n\n**Relevance to FOI Request:** This document is directly relevant as it provides insight into the public and media context surrounding the Australian Electoral Commission's (AEC) investigation into Andrew Laming MP's Facebook pages. It confirms the \"widespread mainstream media coverage\" mentioned in the FOI request overview as a trigger for or concurrent with the inquiry, highlighting public criticism and expectations regarding the AEC's enforcement of electoral authorisation laws concerning Laming's alleged unauthorised social media activities."

Do not include any conversational filler or preamble.To aid you, the overview of the FOI request is: [REQUEST OVERVIEW START] The FOI request disclosed documents detailing the Australian Electoral Commission's (AEC) investigation into Andrew Laming MP's Facebook pages for compliance with federal electoral authorisation laws. This inquiry was triggered by public complaints and media reports, notably from *The Guardian*, alleging Laming used numerous pages (e.g., \"Redland Bay Bulletin,\" \"Redlands Institute\") disguised as community or news groups to promote political content and attack opponents without mandatory disclosures. The AEC confirmed an active investigation, noting 2018 Electoral Act amendments broadened social media authorisation, and issued formal notices to Laming for detailed information and to third parties (like Facebook) for data, with Facebook confirming its cooperation. Findings revealed some pages were removed or updated with authorisation, while others remained active and unauthorised.\n [REQUEST OVERVIEW END] \n\n--- MAIN DOCUMENT TEXT START ---\n\n\n\n--- Page 1 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 2 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 3 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 4 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 5 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 6 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 7 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 8 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 9 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 10 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 11 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 12 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 13 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 14 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 15 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 16 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 17 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 18 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 19 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 20 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 21 ---\n\nAEC.0002.0001.1526\n\n  1-7 April 2021    Third-party posts: Andrew Laming  Widespread mainstream media coverage on 6-8 April led to a large amount of comment on Twitter about Mr Laming’s activities and the AEC’s perceived lack of power/wilingness to act.  This included the typical range of commentary – seeding the expectation that the AEC will ultimately not take action, with many citing a lack or authority, a lack of will or even suggestions of bias. There was also frequent referral to the 2019 “purple signs” matter as an example of the AEC’s “corruption”.   The volume of traffic was significant and mostly negative, as is standard for the channel. Commentary moved on quickly.\n\n\n--- Page 22 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 23 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 24 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 25 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 26 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 27 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 28 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 29 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 30 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 31 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 32 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 33 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 34 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 35 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 36 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 37 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 38 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 39 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 40 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 41 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 42 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 43 ---\n\n\n\n"
