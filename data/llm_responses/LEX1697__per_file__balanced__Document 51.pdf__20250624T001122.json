Do not include any conversational filler or preamble.To aid you, the overview of the FOI request is: [REQUEST OVERVIEW START] The FOI request LEX1697 sought Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) correspondence with major social media platforms (Meta, Twitter, Google, LinkedIn, ByteDance/TikTok) from May 2019, specifically concerning Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 compliance and 2022 Federal election preparations. The released documents, primarily emails, illustrate the AEC's Electoral Integrity and Communications Branch (including the Electoral Interference Taskforce) extensively collaborating with these platforms, particularly TikTok, Google, Twitter, and Meta. This ongoing engagement focused on developing \"Electoral communications escalation scenarios,\" establishing clear communication channels, and implementing protocols to combat misinformation and disinformation in anticipation of the 2022 Federal election, including discussions on TikTok's public service announcements and fact-checking partnerships, and Meta's new reporting portal.\n [REQUEST OVERVIEW END] \n\n--- MAIN DOCUMENT TEXT START ---\n\n\n\n--- Page 1 ---\n\n; Matthew Haigh; \n\n; \n\n; \n\nFrom:\nTo:\nCc:\n\nSubject:\nDate:\nAttachments:\n\nEIAT; Julie Igglesden; \nSocial Media; Authorisation Section; EIAT; \n\n; Alex Morris\n\nRe: FB/AEC/EIAT Liaison [SEC=OFFICIAL:Sensitive]\nMonday, 25 October 2021 8:20:18 AM\nimage001.gif\nimage002.gif\nimage003.gif\nimage004.gif\nimage005.png\nimage006.gif\nimage007.gif\nimage008 png\nimage009.gif\nimage010.gif\nimage011.png\nimage012.gif\nimage013.gif\nimage014.gif\n\nCAUTION: This email originated from outside of the Australian Federal Government.
