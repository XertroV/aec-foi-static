  "prompt": "From a government skeptic's viewpoint, provide a concise, single-paragraph summary in markdown format of the following FOI request overview:\n\nSummary:\n\nThe provided FOI documents offer a stark illustration of government opacity rather than genuine transparency. The only substantial entry concerns a document titled \"Authority to Institute Proceedings – FE22,\" a vague designation that immediately raises questions about the scope and nature of government power being invoked.\n\nCrucially, this document has been granted only \"Access in Part,\" a common euphemism for heavily redacted or largely withheld information. This suggests that while a formal power to initiate potentially significant actions (proceedings) is being exercised, the public is deliberately being kept in the dark about the specifics.\n\nThe justification for this partial access is even more concerning: exemptions S 47F and S 22. These typically relate to protecting personal information and potentially deliberative processes or information that could prejudice ongoing investigations. The application of S 47F indicates a deliberate attempt to shield the identities of individuals involved—be they those granting authority, those receiving it, or those who might be the subject of these \"proceedings.\" This raises red flags about accountability, suggesting the government is prioritizing the privacy of its personnel or targets over the public's right to know who is wielding power and how.\n\nThe use of S 22 further implies that the *reasons* or *methods* behind these \"proceedings\" are being withheld. This allows the government to avoid scrutiny of its decision-making processes, potentially hiding inefficiencies, overreach, or questionable judgment. The combination of these exemptions points to a concerted effort to obscure both *who* is involved and *why/how* they are taking action.\n\nThe subsequent blank pages underscore the extreme lack of information provided. What little insight is offered is heavily curtailed, demonstrating a pattern of withholding rather than revealing, and prioritizing government self-protection over public accountability. The public is left to infer that the government is granting itself powers to initiate undisclosed \"proceedings\" while actively denying full transparency about the nature of these actions, the individuals involved, or the underlying rationale. This perfectly aligns with a skeptical view of government operations, highlighting a default toward secrecy and a reluctance to subject its actions to public scrutiny.\n\nProvide only the markdown formatted summary text. Do not include any conversational filler or preamble."
