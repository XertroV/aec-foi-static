            "text": "The \"Postal Voting Policy\" (February 2022) outlines the Australian Electoral Commission's (AEC) procedures for postal vote applications (PVAs), including categories of voters, application processing, and delivery of voting materials.\n\n**Relevance to FOI Request LEX2846:**\n\n*   **COVID-19 Adaptation & Reduced Mobile Polling:** The document directly reflects the AEC's adaptation to the COVID-19 pandemic by explicitly stating a decision \"not to visit said facilities [nursing homes, hospitals, etc.] for the next election due to the COVID-19 pandemic\" (p.3). This signifies a deliberate reduction in mobile polling for these groups, necessitating a greater reliance on postal voting, aligning with the FOI request's scope.\n*   **Logistical & Financial Challenges:** It addresses logistical and financial considerations for managing increased postal voting. The policy details the use of a \"Service Provider\" for efficient PVA scanning and data capture, and mandates AEC divisional offices to have \"sufficient staff\" and resources for processing (p.7), reflecting the staffing and resource challenges noted in the FOI request. Furthermore, it outlines provisions for \"alternative non-Australia Post delivery options\" (p.9) for postal votes, including cost thresholds and approval processes for special delivery, indicating proactive measures to mitigate logistical hurdles and manage associated financial implications to ensure timely delivery.\n*   **Integrity of New Voting Methods:** The policy emphasizes maintaining the integrity of the postal voting process through strict validation criteria for PVAs (p.6), secure handling and storage of forms and data (p.7), and adherence to the \"Ballot Paper Handling Policy\" for Postal Vote Certificates (p.8, p.10). Procedures for managing silent electors' confidentiality are also detailed (p.9).\n*   **Scope Limitation:** While highly relevant to the \"postal voting policy\" aspect, this document does not contain information regarding the \"Commonwealth Electoral (COVID Enfranchisement) Regulations 2022,\" the \"secure telephone voting system,\" \"Customer Journey\" plans, \"staff scripts,\" or \"COVID-safe measures at polling places,\" which are broader components of the FOI request overview."

Do not include any conversational filler or preamble.To aid you, the overview of the FOI request is: [REQUEST OVERVIEW START] The FOI request LEX2846 illuminated the Australian Electoral Commission's (AEC) extensive preparations for conducting federal elections amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. Released documents detailed the **Commonwealth Electoral (COVID Enfranchisement) Regulations 2022**, establishing a secure telephone voting system for eligible self-isolating voters diagnosed close to polling day, supported by detailed \"Customer Journey\" plans and staff scripts. The AEC also adapted its **postal voting policy** for COVID-positive individuals and noted reduced mobile polling. Revealed were significant **logistical and financial challenges**, including projected cost increases and staffing difficulties, prompting the AEC to seek greater legislative flexibility for emergency election management. The AEC ensured **COVID-safe measures** at polling places and maintained the integrity of new voting methods through staff neutrality, scrutineer observation, and robust complaint mechanisms.\n [REQUEST OVERVIEW END] \n\n--- MAIN DOCUMENT TEXT START ---\n\n\n\n--- Page 1 ---\n\nPOLICY \n\nPostal Voting \n\nFEBRUARY 2022\n\n\n--- Page 2 ---\n\nContents \n\nPurpose of policy ............................................................................................................................................... 3 \n\n1.

Postal voters \n\n1.1  There are two categories of postal voters:  \n\n• \n\n• \n\nThose people that apply for a postal vote for a particular federal event. These people have to \napply to be sent voting papers for the applicable event. \n\nThose people that are registered as a General Postal Voter and have a registration code against \ntheir enrolment record. These people are automatically sent voting papers at the time of any \nelection.  \n\n2.  Postal voting for a particular event \n\n2.1  A person may apply for a postal vote on specified grounds. Those grounds are set out in Schedule 2 \n\nto the Electoral Act. In general terms, an elector may apply for a postal vote if, on polling day, they: \n\n• \n\n• \n\n• \n\n• \n\n• \n\n• \n\n• \n\n• \n\n• \n\n• \n\nare outside the electorate where they are enrolled to vote \n\nare more than 8km from a polling place \n\nare travelling \n\nare unable to leave their workplace to vote \n\nare seriously ill, infirm or due to give birth shortly (or caring for someone who is) \n\nare a patient in hospital and can't vote at the hospital \n\nhave religious beliefs that prevent them from attending a polling place \n\nare in prison serving a sentence of less than three years or otherwise detained \n\nare a silent elector \n\nhave a reasonable fear for their safety. \n\n2.2  A postal vote application (PVA) must be in writing on the form approved by the Electoral \n\nCommissioner (EC) which includes a declaration by the applicant that they are entitled to apply for a \npostal vote. A PVA may also be lodged online. \n\n2.3  An application may not be made until after the public announcement of the proposed date for polling \n\nor after the issue of a writ for an election or referendum (whichever is the earlier) (s 184 and Schedule \n2 of the Electoral Act). An announcement concerning an intended date for polling does not necessarily \nmeet the requirements of s 184 of the Electoral Act. The AEC may issue advice clarifying whether \nPVAs may be accepted in such instances. \n\nNote: The following clause will be affected by the decision that has been made not to visit said facilities for \nthe next election due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Further details on what arrangements will be made for \nthese electors will be released once confirmed. \n\n2.4  As soon as the public announcement of the election date is made, every effort must be made to \n\nensure that PVAs are also made available at places where mobile polling facilities may not be \nprovided during the election period, for example:  \n\n3       POLICY POSTAL VOTING\n\n\n--- Page 4 ---\n\n• \n\n• \n\n• \n\nnursing homes \n\nhospitals \n\nhigh-care facilities (including those in retirement villages and residential mental health facilities) \n\n•  mining camps \n\n• \n\nprisons \n\nNote: It is important to ensure that all places holding stocks of PVAs are made aware of the need to \ndestroy superseded forms where the EC revokes an approved PVA and approves a replacement PVA. \n\n2.5  PVAs must be received by 6 pm on the Wednesday prior to polling day to be accepted. \n\n2.6  Section 184AA of the Electoral Act allows political parties and candidates to distribute PVAs with party \n\nmaterial attached.  \n\n3.  General postal voters (GPVs) \n\n3.1  An elector may apply for registration as a General Postal Voter (GPV), which entitles the elector to \n\nhave postal ballot papers for future federal elections automatically sent to them. \n\n3.2  An application for registration as a GPV must be made on one of the grounds specified in the Electoral \n\nAct (s 184A). In general terms, an elector can register to become a general postal voter if they are: \n\n• \n\n• \n\n• \n\n• \n\n• \n\n• \n\n• \n\n• \n\n• \n\n• \n\n• \n\nenrolled at an address more than 20 km away from a polling place \n\na patient at a hospital or nursing home and unable to travel to a polling place \n\nunable to travel due to being infirm at home \n\ncaring for a seriously ill or infirm person \n\nserving a prison sentence of less than 3 years \n\nregistered as a silent elector \n\nunable to attend a polling place due to religious beliefs \n\nunable to sign their name due to a physical incapacity \n\nregistered as an overseas elector \n\na member of the defence force, or a defence civilian serving outside Australia \n\nan Australian Federal Police officer or staff member serving outside Australia. \n\n3.3  There is no requirement that the application be made on an approved form, however the AEC strongly \nprefers to receive applications on forms approved for this purpose. To register as a GPV, electors can \ncomplete the GPV application form, which is available from any AEC office or on the AEC website.  \n\n3.4  An application to be registered as a GPV can be made at any time (s 185 of the Electoral Act). \n\nAccordingly, the process to register a GPV can also be done at any time. As soon as the ballot papers \nfor an election are available, postal voting papers must be sent to GPVs (s 186 of the Electoral Act). \n\n3.5  The EC must keep a register of GPVs for each division. Each register is to be made available for \ninspection by members of the public at the office of the DRO for the division during ordinary office \nhours (s 184B the Electoral Act). The GPV register must be printed from RMANS and further \ninformation can be found in Roll-How. \n\n3.6  The registration of an elector as a GPV may be cancelled by the EC if the ground on which the elector \n\napplied for registration no longer exists (s 185C of the Electoral Act). Although a registration can be \ncancelled at any such time, it is important to recognise that where that cancellation occurs after the \nclose of the roll for an election, the elector remains entitled to a postal vote for that election. For \ninformation on the cancellation of GPV registrations, see Roll-Why. \n\n4       POLICY POSTAL VOTING\n\n\n--- Page 5 ---\n\n3.7  Unlike PVAs for a particular event, the GPV registration process does not involve supplying or \n\nauthentication of a security question/answer before registration may occur.  \n\n3.8  Any GPV applications received between the close of rolls and the deadline for receiving PVAs can be \n\naccepted as a PVA and as a GPV registration. Because of this, the GPV forms cannot be scanned \nand processed as PVAs by the scanning service provider and instead should be copied and \nprocessed as PVAs manually into the AEC’s automated postal vote issuing system (APVIS) by \ndivisions. The elector should also be registered as a GPV for subsequent events – due to ongoing \nstate and local elections the registration should be completed as soon as possible. \n\n4.  Use of PVAs by candidates and political \n\nparties \n\nSupply of paper PVAs \n\n4.1  Where the EC revokes a PVA form and approves a replacement, the Assistant Commissioner, \n\nDelivery and Support Branch is to contact all registered political parties, to advise them of the new \napproved form and the need to destroy superseded forms that may be being held as stock. \n\n4.2  All members, Senators and candidates will be encouraged to promote the Online Postal Vote \n\nApplication (OPVA) with their constituents. This service ensures that the AEC receives the \napplications in a timely manner and can send the postal vote pack out as soon as possible. \n\n4.3 \n\nIf requests for paper PVA forms (and reply envelopes) are received by states and divisions, these \nmust be redirected to the Elector and Roll Services team. This team will then investigate the reasons \nfor the request and if the OPVA is not suitable, will direct them to the pdf version on the AEC website. \nThis includes requests from  \n\n•  Members and Senators \n\n• \n\n• \n\n• \n\n• \n\npolitical parties \n\ncandidates \n\nstate/territory members of parliament \n\npolitical interest groups (unions, lobby groups, peak industry bodies). \n\nReproduction of PVAs \n\n4.4  Subsection 184AA(1) of the Electoral Act allows a postal vote application form to be “physically \n\nattached to, or form part of, other written materials issued by any person or organisation.” This allows \nfor political parties to provide PVAs to constituents alongside election materials.  \n\n4.5  The majority of paper PVA forms received by the AEC for processing during an event are those which \nhave been reproduced by a political party or candidates. It is important that the AEC communicates to \npolitical parties and candidates the importance of reproduced PVAs aligning with legislative \nrequirements to ensure electors are not disenfranchised and the scanning of said forms is as efficient \nas possible.  \n\n4.6 \n\nIt is the State Manager’s role to communicate PVA requirements with political parties in the lead-up to \nelectoral events however Elector and Roll Services will provide information and guidance regarding \nthe key points related to postal voting. The information obtained from political parties these meetings \n(e.g. what their plans are regarding postal voting) should be treated confidentially; at a minimum it \nshould be known by the relevant State Manager, Director Operations, Director of Elector and Roll \nServices Section in NO, and the relevant DRO. \n\n4.7  The AEC provides print-ready artwork of the approved form and guidelines for its reproduction to any \n\nperson or organisation that wishes to reproduce PVAs. Requests to obtain a copy of the approved \n\n5       POLICY POSTAL VOTING\n\n\n--- Page 6 ---\n\nform and guidelines are to be made to the Director, Elector and Roll Services Section in National \nOffice (NO) through the AEC Service Desk. The office lodging this request via the AEC Service Desk \nmust also ensure that the relevant AEO is to be advised of this request. \n\n4.8  When dealing with candidates and political parties it is useful to ascertain relevant information \n\nconcerning their postal vote mail campaigns and provide information to them regarding AEC \nprocesses. Relevant information includes approximate volumes, areas of letterbox drops, and dates \nand intended method of delivery, noting that, if a Service Provider is being used, completed paper \nPVAs must be sent directly to that provider. This exchange of information will assist offices to manage \nthe workload, especially planned peaks in activity, but as this information is confidential (see 4.6) \nsteps must be taken to ensure only the information shared within the AEC network as needed.  \n\n5.  Receipt of PVAs \n\n5.1  Divisional offices (DOs) are not required to stay open to the public until 6pm on the Wednesday three \ndays before polling day to enable receipt of PVAs. However if members of the public come to a \ndivisional office when it is closed to the public, but staff are inside working, staff should attend to the \nperson and assist wherever possible. This may include accepting a paper form for processing. \n\n5.2  The PVA scanning provider must stay open until 6pm (local time) on the Wednesday three days \n\nbefore polling day to enable receipt of PVAs (s 184(5) of the Electoral Act). The scanning provider \nmust clear PO boxes, scan, vet and provide the data from the PVAs that evening to ensure the Postal \nVote Packs (PVP) can be produced and lodged as soon as possible.  \n\n5.3  Divisions must also factor in time to process after this deadline into their staffing plans, noting that \nOPVA and scanned PVA data may not appear in the manual intervention or local print queues until \n6.30pm (local time) due to the background system work. \n\n5.4  PVAs may be made to the EC or, in the case of an application made outside of Australia, also to an \n\nAssistant Returning Officer (ARO) (s 184 of the Electoral Act). \n\n5.5  While every effort should be made to ensure that superseded forms are destroyed, a PVA that is \nmade on a superseded form should be accepted if the application substantially complies with the \napproved form, that is, if the application contains all the information that is required by the Electoral \nAct and is received before 6pm on the Wednesday three days before polling day. \n\n• \n\nFor example, a form stating it must be received by 6pm Thursday two days before polling day \n(forms used at 2013 election stated this) may be accepted, but only if it satisfies the essential \ncriteria set out below. \n\n5.6  The following criteria are essential for a PVA to be considered valid: \n\n• \n\nthe application must include a declaration of entitlement to apply for a postal vote (s 184(1) of the \nElectoral Act) \n\n− \n\n− \n\npaper applications – the declaration of entitlement is the signature \n\nonline applications – the declaration of entitlement is the submission of the form \n\n• \n\n• \n\n• \n\nthe application must be dated (note – the date is automatically generated if a PVA is submitted \nonline) \n\nthe date must not be before the announcement of or issue of writ for an election or referendum \n(an incorrect date in the future however is acceptable provided the PVA is received on time) \n\nthe application must be received by 6pm on the Wednesday three days before polling day \n(s 184(5) of the Electoral Act) (refer to clause 6.10 in this policy). \n\nPVAs not meeting these criteria must be rejected and a defective PVA letter sent to the \napplicant. \n\n5.7  The following criteria are not essential for a PVA to be considered valid: \n\n6       POLICY POSTAL VOTING\n\n\n--- Page 7 ---\n\n• \n\n• \n\n• \n\n• \n\n• \n\n• \n\napplicant’s full name details (e.g. an initial is given instead of a given name) \n\napplicant’s enrolled address details \n\napplicant’s date of birth \n\npostal address \n\ncontact phone number or email address \n\nsecurity question and answer \n\nIf a PVA is missing any or all of these details it must still be accepted. \n\n5.8  The assessment of substantial compliance on non-PVA forms (i.e. letters, form reproductions etc.) \nmust be sent to the Elector and Roll Services team. A decision on these will be done on a case by \ncase basis by the Assistant Commissioner, Elector and Roll Services Section (or delegate) and advice \nprovided to staff directly or via the intranet (if a trend emerges). \n\n5.9 \n\nIf a PVA meets the essential requirements set out above, the postal voting material must be sent to \nthe applicant (s.188(1) of the Electoral Act). \n\n6.  Processing paper PVA forms  \n\n6.1 \n\nInformation from PVA forms will be captured electronically (via a Service Provider with OCR/ICR \ncapability) and/or manually via data entry by AEC staff in RMANS APVIS. \n\n6.2  Timeliness and quality are paramount in either of the above options. If a Service Provider is used: \n\n6.2.1  Arrangements will be made to ensure they receive the paper PVAs as soon as possible. This will \ninclude directions to candidates and parties to directly deliver bulk PVAs to the Service Provider, \nthe Service Provider managing the PO Boxes advertised on the form and AEC website for \nreturned completed forms and the electronic transfer of PVAs from AEC offices to the Service \nProvider. \n\n6.2.2  Strict business and quality rules will be established to ensure correct identification of paper \nPVAs and the correct and efficient capture of data on said forms. These vetting rules will be \npublished before each election and exceptions to these rules will be managed by Elector and \nRoll Services.  \n\n6.2.3  The Service Provider will regularly feed PVA data back to the AEC. This data will be processed \n\nin RMANS APVIS  \n\nNote: A paper PVA form may meet the vetting rules in 6.2.2 but will still need divisional intervention in \nRMANS APVIS if RMANS cannot make the necessary matches to determine entitlement. \n\n6.3  The Service Provider will hold PVA images in an accessible repository for scrutiny and archiving \n\nprocesses. Staff will have access to these images via RMANS APVIS and Declaration Vote Scrutiny \nsub-systems.  \n\n6.4 \n\nIf a Service Provider isn’t being used, PVAs can be manually entered by divisional staff in AEC offices, \nOPCs or in state cells, depending on state management plans.  \n\n6.5  States must ensure that they have sufficient staff (with appropriate systems and RMANS APVIS \n\naccess) and resources to: \n\n6.5.1 \n\nreceive PVAs and transfer them to the Service Provider (as long as the PVA is received by the \nAEC by the deadline); and  \n\n6.5.2  process PVA records received back from the Service Provider in RMANS APVIS efficiently, \n\nincluding after the 6pm deadline. \n\n6.6  Forms processed in AEC offices must be stored securely as they contain personal information.  \n\n7       POLICY POSTAL VOTING\n\n\n--- Page 8 ---\n\nForwarding paper PVAs received in an AEC office to the Service \nProvider \n\n6.7 \n\nIf a Service Provider is being used, staff are reminded that the Service Provider’s processes will result \nin a timelier capture of data, depending on when the forms are sent to them. Therefore, staff must \nsend all paper PVAs to the Service Provider either via electronic transfer or courier. For example:  \n\n• \n\nif a box of forms is dropped off (e.g. by a candidate or party official), then AEC staff must advise \nthat they should be delivered to the Service Providers address. If they refuse to deliver them to \nthe correct address, or they have been left by a courier, then that box of PVAs should be \ncouriered directly to the Service Provider as is (i.e. the box shouldn’t be opened and checked). If \n1-100 forms are received, states and divisions must electronically send them to the Service \nProvider as they are received. \n\no  Forms electronically sent to the Service Provider must be stored securely, but separately to \n\nthose in 6.6 \n\n•  However, if that box is received between 12-6pm on the Wednesday before polling day, the box \n\nshould be opened and the PVAs transferred electronically to the Service Provider. Whilst strict \nvetting is not required in this scenario, the removal of obviously incomplete or non-PVA material \nshould be done. \n\n6.8  GPV forms must be retained in the office and processed directly into RMANS APVIS. \n\nFailure to meet deadline for PVA \n\n6.9 \n\n If a PVA is received after 6pm on the Wednesday three days before polling day, it fails to meet the \ndeadline and the applicant should be advised of that fact and that they will have to vote by other \nmeans (s 184(5), 184(6) of the Electoral Act).  \n\n6.10 \n\nIf the PVA is received by the Service Provider, the AEC may decide to use their services to send a \n“PVA received too late” message (via email or SMS) to the applicant. The Service Provider will also \nscan and transfer the data contained on the PVA to the AEC.  \n\n6.11 \n\nIf the paper PVA is received by an AEC office then AEC staff should attempt to contact the elector and \nprocess the PVA in RMANS APVIS as too late. \n\n6.12 \n\nIf a large number of forms are received by AEC offices after the deadline but before polling day (i.e. \nfrom a candidate or party) these should be sent to the Service Provider (if being used) as they will be \nable to scan and notify applicants more efficiently than divisional staff. \n\n7. \n\nIssuing postal votes \n\n7.1 \n\nIf the EC or an ARO receives a PVA that meets one of the specified grounds, the EC or ARO must \nsend a Postal Voting Certificate (PVC) and the postal voting papers to the applicant.  \n\n7.2  Postal voting material (including the PVC) may be generated and issued centrally (via a Service \n\nProvider), locally or by a ‘hybrid’ method, where for certain postcodes the system will use local printing \nfrom a particular location regardless of where the PVA was processed. RMANS APVIS will be used to \ndetermine the method that ensures the best possible delivery timeframe.  \n\n7.3  PVCs with House of Representatives ballot paper stock attached to them are considered ballot \n\npapers. The handling, storing and transporting of PVCs must comply with requirements of the Ballot \nPaper Handling Policy, prior to, during dispatching and upon return to the division. Preparation and \nissuing of PVCs must be done in a ballot paper secure working zone whether being dispatched by a \nService Provider or AEC office. \n\n7.4 \n\nIt is expected that RMANS APVIS would be used to issue all PVCs, however in circumstances where \nthe system is not available (e.g. due to a network or power failure) it may be necessary to issue PVCs \nmanually (see Producing Postal Vote Certificates SOP).  \n\n8       POLICY POSTAL VOTING\n\n\n--- Page 9 ---\n\n8.  Delivery of postal votes \n\n8.1  The AEC endeavours to deliver postal votes in sufficient time for the elector to vote before 6pm on \npolling day. Postal vote material must be sent by post or other means, not being electronic means \nsuch as fax or email.  \n\n8.2  Postal votes are normally delivered to the applicant by Australia Post priority service, however for all \n\nPVAs received before 6pm on the Wednesday three days before polling day, the postal voting material \nmust be sent to the applicant by a means considered to be the most reasonable and practicable in the \ncircumstances (s 188(2) of the Electoral Act). \n\n8.3  Therefore all divisions must develop a postal vote delivery plan that does not depend on Australia Post \nfactors in the time taken to print locally and collate the PVC packs. This will require divisions to \ninvestigate the alternative non-Australia Post delivery options available in their divisions for sending \npostal voting material where the postcode is hybrid in RMANS APVIS or local knowledge indicates \nthat delivery by means other than Australia Post needs to be considered. \n\n8.4  Where the use of standard, priority or express postal services or standard courier services is likely to \nlead to disenfranchisement, other services can be used as long as delivery of the voting material can \nbe achieved within the necessary timeframes and does not exceed a cost of $100 per elector \nserviced. \n\n• \n\nFor example: delivering postal votes to a remote township of 20 electors at a cost of $1,500 \nwould be acceptable since the cost is $75 per elector.  \n\n8.5  Reasonable and practicable means of delivery includes: \n\n• \n\n• \n\ncommercially available couriers \n\nvehicle or taxi use by an AEC staff member. \n\n8.6  Reasonable and practicable means does not extend to providing a PVC to a third party authorised by \n\nthe applicant. \n\n8.7  The EC (or delegate) may decide that Australia Post is still a reasonable and practicable means of \ndelivery. This would apply in circumstances where a postcode receives regular mail services.  \n\n8.8  A means of sending postal voting material will not be a reasonable and practicable means of delivery if \nit cannot be expected that the applicant would receive that material in sufficient time to vote before \nclose of polling (s 194 of the Electoral Act). \n\n8.9  DROs must receive approval (including Rule 18 financial approval) from state office if they use a \n\nmeans of delivery other than those described above. Any service which exceeds the cost per elector \nthreshold is to be treated as a policy exception. \n\n9.  Silent electors \n\n9.1  Most silent electors are registered as GPVs, and receive postal voting material automatically through \n\ncentral production, however some may choose to apply for postal votes.  \n\n9.2  Silent electors are able to apply using the online PVA system, however it is recommended they use \n\nalternative forms of voting to ensure maximum confidentiality of their information. \n\n9.3 \n\nIf a silent elector chooses to lodge a PVA online or their paper PVA is sent to the scanning centre, \ntheir classified information will be suppressed in RMANS APVIS once they are matched as a silent \nelector. \n\n9.4 \n\nIf a silent elector’s Postal Vote Pack (PVP) can be printed and lodged via central print, then the \nrelevant data will be sent as part of the daily postal voting data file to the Service Provider. \n\n9       POLICY POSTAL VOTING\n\n\n--- Page 10 ---\n\n9.5 \n\n9.6 \n\nIf a local or hybrid print PVP is required, then only an AEC employee that has permission from the \nAEC to deal with silent electors can manually prepare postal voting materials for silent electors.  \n\nIf the elector has included their enrolled address on a PVA (that is stored in a divisional office) it must \nbe masked or obliterated by using a black marker pen. \n\n10.  Replacement of spoilt, missing, lost or \n\ndestroyed postal ballot papers  \n\n10.1  A postal voter who spoils a postal ballot paper may obtain another postal ballot paper by returning the \nspoilt ballot paper to any AEC office. A replacement postal ballot paper may then be posted or issued \npersonally to the voter at any time up to the close of the poll. However, the postal voting material must \nnot be sent by post (or any other means) if it cannot be expected that the applicant would receive that \nmaterial in sufficient time to vote before close of polling (s 194 of the Electoral Act). \n\n10.1.1  If a person cannot physically attend the office to return their spoilt ballot paper, and they claim \n\nthat they cannot make their intended preference clear, advice should be sought from Elector and \nRoll Services on how to proceed (via the AEC Service Desk) \n\n10.2 \n\nIf an elector claims that their ballot paper (or PVC) has been lost, destroyed beyond salvage, or was \nnever received, a new PVC may be issued by reprocessing the PVA, provided the elector has \nprovided written confirmation attesting to this. \n\n11.  Postal ballot papers returned undelivered \n\n11.1  Any postal voting material returned undelivered prior to polling day should be dealt with immediately. \nEvery effort should be made to re-direct the postal voting materials and document steps taken, if any \nare possible, to achieve this (see Postal Voting SOP). \n\n12.  Receipting postal vote certificates \n\n12.1  PVCs are to be receipted on their arrival at AEC premises. This may be conducted at the divisional \noffice, state processing cell, or once transferred to the divisional out-posted centre. The process for \nreceipting PVCs is covered in the Receiving Postal Votes SOP. Note that PVCs are ballot papers and \nare to be handled in accordance with the Ballot Paper Handling Policy. \n\n12.2  PVCs must be receipted up to and after the 13 day post polling receipt period. This information flows \ninto ELMS allowing for accurate estimates for declaration exchange, postal scrutinies and the virtual \ntally room advising parties, candidates and the general public as to how many votes are left to count \nand how many were too late. The Elector and Roll Services team will advise when the RMANS Dec \nVote Scrutiny system is locked and when receipting PVCs can cease. All PVCs received after the \ncutoff must remain securely stored until otherwise advised. \n\n10       POLICY POSTAL VOTING\n\n\n--- Page 11 ---\n\nGlossary for postal voting \n\nAutomated Postal Vote Issuing System (RMANS APVIS): is an election sub-system of the Roll \nManagement System (RMANS EP) used for the registration of PVA details to issue PVCs or defective \nletters. APVIS also captures the date of lodgement with Australia Post and when the PVC is returned to the \nAEC. \n\nBallot paper secure work zone: designated and segregated area, clearly marked via use of bollards, \ndividers or tape, for the interim placement of ballot papers while they are in use and it is not practicable to \nundertake the work in a storage zone (see Ballot Paper Handling Policy). \n\nComputershare (CCS): AEC’s PVA scanning and PVP mail house services contractor who will receive, \nscan and vet all postal vote applications and prepare and lodge PVPs. \n\nGeneral Postal Voter (GPV): an elector who is registered to have postal ballot papers sent to them \nautomatically. Electors from certain categories who have difficulty getting to a polling place on polling day \ncan register as a GPV. \n\nOptical Character Recognition / Intelligent Character Recognition (OCR/ICR): OCR/ICR technologies \ntranslate scanned images into data that can be used in database systems and verified against other data. \n\nOnline Postal Vote Application (OPVA): an electronic form that allows an applicant to securely submit a \nPVA to the AEC using any web-enabled device in Australia or overseas. \n\nPostal voter: a voter who satisfies one of the grounds of application for postal vote set out in Schedule 2 of \nthe Electoral Act and who may apply in writing for a postal vote using a PVA form. Upon receipt of a PVA, \npostal voting material will be dispatched for completion and return prior to the close of poll. \n\nPostal Vote Application (PVA): an application for a postal vote which must be in writing on the form \napproved by the Electoral Commissioner which includes a declaration by the applicant that they are entitled \nto apply for a postal vote. A PVA may also be lodged online.  \n\nPostal Vote Certificate (PVC): the declaration specific to postal voting on which the elector declares their \nentitlement to vote. PVCs may be produced using PVA information entered into APVIS by either: \n\n•  Central production: a PVP is produced centrally to ensure timely delivery to the postal voter. \n\n•  Hybrid print production: where the postcode has only one or two mail deliveries per week and \nAPVIS determines if the PVC is best printed by the owning divisions or another nominated \ndivision. \n\n• \n\nLocal print production: printing PVCs in divisional/state offices when central production could \nnot ensure timely delivery of the PVP. \n\nPostal Vote Pack (PVP) or postal voting materials: the certificate and ballot papers issued to an applicant \nfor a postal vote. A postal vote pack consists of the following and are inserted into an outer envelope \naddressed to the elector. \n\n• \n\n• \n\n• \n\n• \n\nthe printed PVC with attached House of Representatives ballot paper \n\nSenate ballot paper \n\nreferendum ballot papers (if applicable) \n\na domestic or overseas postal voting leaflet (Getting help to complete your postal vote leaflet \n(EF045) if within Australia, or How to complete your overseas postal vote (EF610) if overseas)  \n\n•  Domestic or overseas return envelope. \n\n11       POLICY POSTAL VOTING\n\n\n--- Page 12 ---\n\nRelevant policies and references \n\nBallot Paper Handling Policy \n\nRMANS Election Processing User Manual, Subpart 3 RMANS Automated Postal Voting Issuing System \n\nELMS Quick Reference Guide – Ballot Paper Printing \n\nPreliminary Scrutiny SOP \n\nPostal Vote Application Processing SOP \n\nProducing Postal Vote Certificates SOP \n\nReceiving Postal Votes SOP \n\nRoll-Why \n\n12       POLICY POSTAL VOTING\n\n"
