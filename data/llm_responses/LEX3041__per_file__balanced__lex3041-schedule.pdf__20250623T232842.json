Do not include any conversational filler or preamble.To aid you, the overview of the FOI request is: [REQUEST OVERVIEW START] FOI Request LEX3041 sought a list of \"foreign objects\" (non-ballots) found in ballot boxes and the Australian Electoral Commission's (AEC) response procedures. The AEC released the Election Procedures Handbook, Prematurely Opened Ballot Box Policy, and Prematurely Opened Ballot Box SOP. These documents reveal that the AEC's primary response to \"foreign objects\" (like personal items) is non-retrieval, as opening a box to retrieve such items would compromise electoral integrity, and no procedures or forms for listing or describing non-ballot foreign objects exist. While the \"Prematurely Opened\" documents detail handling for ballot boxes opened prematurely due to issues like seal discrepancies or damage, their focus is on managing the integrity and inclusion/exclusion of *ballots* and declaration vote envelopes, not on cataloging non-ballot items, consistently prioritizing the \"integrity of the result.\"\n [REQUEST OVERVIEW END] \n\n--- MAIN DOCUMENT TEXT START ---\n\n\n\n--- Page 1 ---\n\nRequest for: \n\nFOI REQUEST NO.
