The core focus is on how the AEC and these platforms are preparing for the upcoming federal election, specifically addressing concerns related to AI-generated content, misinformation, disinformation, and ensuring public access to accurate electoral information.\n\n**Documents from the FOI Request:**\nThe released documents primarily consist of email exchanges, meeting invitations, and formal letters between the AEC's Defending Democracy Unit (DDU) and Electoral Integrity Assurance Taskforce (EIAT), and representatives from the specified online platforms. Most documents were granted \"Partial Access\" (subject to exemptions like S 22, S 47E(d), S 47F(1)), indicating redactions of potentially sensitive personal, commercial, or deliberative information. A few documents with redacted subject lines were entirely refused access (S 37), likely due to high sensitivity related to privacy or business affairs.\n\n**Main Content from the FOI Request Documents:**\n\nThe documents reveal extensive, proactive engagement between the AEC and major online platforms, focusing on preparedness for the next federal election (FE25) and drawing lessons from recent global electoral events.\n\n#### Common Themes Across Platforms:\n*   **Electoral Integrity:** Addressing threats such as misinformation, disinformation, cyberattacks, and foreign interference.\n*   **Artificial Intelligence (AI):** A significant focus on the impact of generative AI, deepfakes, content labelling, detection, and the platforms' policies and tools (e.g., watermarking, content provenance).\n*   **Collaboration & Escalation Pathways:** Establishing and confirming clear mechanisms for the AEC and EIAT to flag potential issues and concerns to the platforms.\n*   **Media Literacy & Education Campaigns:** Discussions around initiatives to educate voters on identifying trusted information and navigating the online information environment.\n*   **Lessons from Global Elections:** Platforms sharing insights and observations from recent elections worldwide (e.g., US, UK, India, EU, Taiwan, Indonesia) to inform Australian preparedness.\n*   **Security for Campaigns & Electoral Processes:** Discussions on protecting electoral infrastructure and individuals from cyber threats.\n\n#### Key Content by Platform:\n\n*   **X (formerly Twitter):**\n    *   The AEC requested a meeting with X representatives to discuss \"what X may have learned from global elections this year, in preparation for the next Australian federal election.\"\n\n*   **Google/YouTube:**\n    *   **Meetings & Agenda:** Regular meetings were planned to debrief on Google's AI approach post-US election, discuss content provenance on YouTube, address \"Sovereign Citizen\" misinformation, and confirm support for FE25.\n    *   **AI Policies & Tools:** Discussions included YouTube's Community Guidelines, AI labelling, and the \"Hit Pause\" media literacy campaign. Google's formal response detailed policies on misinformation/disinformation (including manipulated media), ads disclosures for synthetic content, content labels on YouTube, restrictions on election-related queries in Gemini, and watermarking using SynthID. Google also referenced its participation in the \"Tech Accord to Combat Deceptive Use of AI in 2024 Elections.\"\n    *   **Incident Response:** An instance where the AEC reported a YouTube video falsely claiming digital ID requirements for FE25, which subsequently led to the channel's termination.\n    *   **Electoral Promotion:** Collaboration on a \"Plan on a Page\" for YouTube, including proposed \"How to Vote,\" \"AEC Playlist,\" \"Where to Vote,\" and \"Results\" promotional videos for the AEC.\n\n*   **Meta (Facebook, Instagram, etc.):**\n    *   **Proactive Engagement:** Meetings focused on Meta's policy settings, referral/escalation pathways, and observations from global elections, particularly concerning generative AI's use.\n    *   **Action Item Follow-up:** The AEC actively followed up on Meta's commitments regarding:\n        *   Media literacy programs (e.g., \"Check The Facts\" with AAP for the 2023 referendum and efforts on AI-generated content).\n        *   Network disruption efforts against specific influence groups (e.g., the Russian 'Doppelganger' group).\n        *   Meta's approach to AI in political advertising, specifically seeking lessons learned from reported incidents during the Indian election.\n        *   Detailed responses to Russian-linked influence efforts detected in the UK election.\n    *   **AI & Manipulated Media:** Meta previously provided information on its manipulated media policy adjustments, labelling of AI-generated images, AI Ad Disclosure policy, and its role as a Tech Accord signatory.\n\n*   **Microsoft/LinkedIn:**\n    *   **Comprehensive Engagement:** Multiple meetings were planned with various AEC branches (Cyber, CIO, Acting Electoral Commissioner, EIAT).\n    *   **Cybersecurity & Threat Intelligence:** Microsoft shared insights from its Digital Defense Report 2024, highlighting nation-state threats, the convergence of nation-state actors and cybercriminals, and AI's role in cybercrime. Discussions included Microsoft's AccountGuard service and threat intelligence from its Threat Analysis Center (MTAC) and Threat Intelligence Center (MSTIC).\n    *   **AI Integration & Protection:** Microsoft detailed its commitment to the Tech Accord, including implementing Content Credentials for AI-generated images (across products like Bing, Designer, Copilot, DALL-E, Word, LinkedIn), a pilot program for applying Content Credentials to authentic media, and the \"Microsoft-2024 Elections site\" for reporting deceptive AI.\n    *   **Personalized AI Protection:** The AEC requested a mechanism to block specific prominent AEC employees (including former and acting Electoral Commissioners, etc.) from being reproduced by Microsoft's AI image-generating tools. Microsoft confirmed they could action this and requested a list of names.\n    *   **LinkedIn Collaboration:** Plans were made to establish a meeting with LinkedIn representatives to discuss referral pathways and content concerns.\n    *   **External Challenges:** Microsoft was asked about a US subpoena regarding foreign censorship of American speech, to which they confirmed they were working on a response.\n\n*   **TikTok:**\n    *   **AI Accord Commitment:** TikTok's formal response to the AEC outlined its commitment to the 'AI Elections Accord,' emphasizing policies against misinformation, hate speech, and manipulated media.\n    *   **Transparency & Operations:** Highlighted the use of automated systems alongside human review, requiring disclosure for synthetic content, and providing monthly public reporting on Covert Influence Operations.\n    *   **FE25 Preparations:** TikTok established a dedicated working group for the Australian election, maintained AEC access to its content reporting portal, committed to in-app redirection to authoritative AEC information, conducted impersonation sweeps for candidates, issued policy guidance for moderation (including AI-generated content), and set up communication pathways with government agencies.\n    *   **AEC Questions:** The AEC posed specific questions regarding positive uses of TikTok in elections (e.g., education, enrolment), whether its algorithm prioritizes authoritative sources (AEC, ABC), election-specific filters, and lessons learned/guardrails from past AI-enabled misinformation incidents on TikTok.\n    *   **In-App Content:** Collaboration on the content for TikTok's proposed 'in-app' information hub for the federal election, including sections like \"Stop and consider,\" \"Ways to vote,\" \"Preferential voting,\" and \"Where to vote.\""
