            "text": "This document lays bare the Australian Electoral Commission's (AEC) perilous, reactive, and ultimately subservient posture in the face of colossal tech monopolies. Far from demonstrating proactive defence of electoral integrity, these exchanges reveal an agency constantly chasing the crumbs of engagement from Google and YouTube, whose profit-driven inaction and corporate boilerplate responses directly undermine democratic safeguards.\n\n**Every Flaw, Missed Opportunity, and Potential Harm:**\n\n*   **Pathetic Reactive Scramble:** The AEC's initial outreach to Google regarding generative AI in June 2024 is met with a staggering month-long delay in response, indicative of how low a priority Australian electoral integrity is for the tech giant. Subsequent scheduling attempts highlight a pattern of the AEC meekly requesting availability, bending to Google's calendar and \"busy\" legislative schedules, rather than dictating terms or demanding urgent engagement on critical threats. The \"Canceled: AEC meeting with Google & YouTube\" entry further underscores the fragility and instability of these engagements, revealing the AEC's inability to secure consistent, high-level attention.\n*   **Superficial Engagements Cloaked in Corporate Platitudes:** The multiple meeting agendas, while superficially addressing crucial topics like AI debriefs, content provenance, and \"Sovereign Citizen\" misinformation, yield no visible, concrete outcomes or binding commitments within this document. Google's formal letter, in response to AEC concerns about AI, is a masterclass in corporate PR – a self-congratulatory reiteration of existing policies (SynthID, ad disclosures, \"About this image\") and industry consortium memberships (C2PA). This is not genuine collaboration but a deliberate obfuscation, offering no specific, actionable improvements or tangible accountability for the Australian context, merely recycled talking points designed to project an illusion of responsibility.\n*   **Catastrophic Misinformation Failure and Gross Incompetence:** The most egregious failure is the revelation that a YouTube video propagating *false claims* about a \"digital ID\" requirement for the upcoming Federal Election (FE25) was allowed to fester, garnering \"75k+ views\" before the AEC's \"Social Media Team\" even detected and reported it. This is a damning indictment of YouTube's content moderation and proactive detection mechanisms, demonstrating a profound dereliction of duty. The \"solution\"? A belated termination of the *channel* – a reactive Band-Aid after the informational poison has already spread widely, potentially disenfranchising voters and eroding trust. The AEC's own \"social media team are already feeling it!\" even before the election is called, starkly illustrates their overwhelmed and outmanoeuvred state, a direct consequence of unaccountable tech platforms.\n*   **Subservience and Lost Agency:** The AEC is depicted as a supplicant, even when trying to correct factual errors. When Gemini initially *declined to respond* to a basic enrolment query, then merely defaulted to a \"scripted answer\" rather than providing accurate information, the AEC's \"gold star\" suggestion for a *link* to their website is a pitiful plea. This reveals Google's systems as either too complex or too unwilling to be tailored for fundamental electoral accuracy. Furthermore, the AEC's digital campaign discussions with YouTube show them deferring to YouTube's format preferences (\"ideally not square\") even for their own critical \"How to Vote\" and \"Where to Vote\" content, highlighting Google's control over the informational delivery mechanisms and, implicitly, over the AEC's public messaging.\n*   **Misguided Priorities and Lack of Accountability:** While the AEC is seen flagging a proposed amendment to protect staff images from being recorded in polling places – a comparatively minor concern – they appear fundamentally incapable of securing concrete, proactive commitments from Google on systemic AI threats and pervasive misinformation. The constant use of \"Microsoft Office prevented automatic download of this picture\" in the document itself, potentially due to AEC's own IT settings or Microsoft's defaults, can be seen as an ironic microcosm of the AEC's internal focus on low-level \"privacy\" while the larger, more existential threats to democratic integrity go unaddressed or are merely \"discussed.\"\n\nThis document paints a grim picture: an AEC desperately trying to engage, constantly outmanoeuvred and deprioritised by tech monopolies whose profit motives clearly trump the integrity of Australian elections. The informational landscape remains implicitly shaped by unaccountable corporations, leaving Australian democracy dangerously exposed."

  "prompt": "Critically summarize this specific document within the FOI request context. Point out every flaw, missed opportunity, or potential harm. Frame the content in the most negative light possible, questioning motives and outcomes. The overall FOI overview is: The released FOI documents paint a damning portrait of an Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) whose Electoral Integrity Assurance Taskforce is not merely dependent but demonstrably subservient to the very tech giants enabling election interference, a reality deliberately cloaked by pervasive \"Partial Access\" and \"Refuse Access\" exemptions that gut public accountability. Far from a robust defence, the AEC's engagement is a pathetic, reactive scramble, constantly outmanoeuvred by corporate agendas: Meta brazenly stonewalls on AI-incited violence and crucial intelligence, Microsoft leverages \"Democracy Forward\" as a self-serving sales pitch for proprietary tools while the AEC pathetically prioritises protecting staff images over systemic AI threats, and Google/YouTube’s catastrophic failures allow blatant misinformation to garner 75k+ views before the AEC's own overwhelmed team even detects it. The virtually non-existent engagement with X, a disinformation cesspool, underscores either utter capitulation or shocking incompetence, leaving Australian democracy dangerously exposed, its informational landscape implicitly shaped by unaccountable tech monopolies whose profit motives clearly trump the integrity of future elections.\n\nDocument Text:\n\nSubject:\nLocation:\n\nStart:\nEnd:\nShow Time As:\n\nCanceled: AEC meeting with Google & YouTube [SEC=OFFICIAL]\nMicrosoft Teams Meeting\n\nMon 16/12/2024 10:00 AM\nMon 16/12/2024 10:30 AM\nFree\n\nRecurrence:\n\n(none)\n\nMeeting Status:\n\nNot yet responded\n\nOrganiser:\nRequired Attendees:\n\nOptional Attendees:\n\nDefending Democracy Unit\n\n Matthew Haigh\n\nImportance:\n\nHigh\n\nHi \n\n and \n\nAs discussed, pu(cid:427)ng this (cid:415)me in the calendar for a post-US elec(cid:415)on, pre-Christmas check-in.  \n\nAgenda items/follow up for discussion to include: \n\n  A debrief on Google’s approach to AI in elections after gaining insight from the US presidential \n\nelection on 5 November \n\n  Content provenance/authenticity and how it works on content uploaded to YouTube  \n  Google and YouTube to provide information and insights into Sovereign Citizen promotion of \n\nmisinformation/disinformation respective platforms \n\n  Google and YouTube support for the next Australian federal election \n  AEC to share trends in the election information environment with Google and YouTube \n\nKind regards, \n\n________________________________________________________________________________ \n\nMicrosoft Teams Need help?  \n\nJoin the meeting now  \n\nMeeting ID: \n\nPasscode:\n\nFor organizers: Meeting options  \n\n1\n\ns47Fs47Fs47Fs47Fs47Fs47Es47Es22 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n\fTo help p o ect y ou  p iv acy  M c osoft Off ce p ev ented au omat c download of th s pictu e f om the Inte net\n\nThis meeting invitation was generated by the AEC Microsoft Teams instance \n\n________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n2\n\n \n \n\fFrom:\nSent:\nTo:\nCc:\nSubject:\n\nGood morning \n\n, \n\nThursday, 18 July 2024 9:03 AM\n\nDefending Democracy Unit; \nConfirming meeting scheduled for 24 July | AEC & Google [SEC=OFFICIAL]\n\n; \n\nThanks for getting back to us.

Our team \nreferred this under ‘misinformation’ as follows: \n\nThe video’s claim that “digital identity verification for voting” has been introduced for the 2025 federal \nelection is false. ID is not required when voting in Australian federal elections, and there have been no \nrecent changes in this area. \n\nThe erroneous claim presents the following risks: \n\n Disenfranchising Australian voters who view the video and believe they won’t be able to vote due to \nnot having a digital ID. (Or that they may not be able to vote if they haven’t linked a digital ID to \ntheir enrolment). \n\n Damaging the perceived integrity of Australian federal elections due to the implication voter privacy \n\nmay be compromised. \n\nAs of this morning it’s still up/unlabelled/unmoderated but it was only referred yesterday afternoon. \n\nThe election hasn’t been called yet, but the social media team are already feeling it! \n\nAlso , thanks for the link you shared after our meeting earlier this week.

We appreciate the \nAustralian Electoral Commission's (AEC) ongoing collaboration with online platforms and share your commitment to \nmaintaining public trust in Australia's democratic processes. Google recognises the potential risks AI poses to electoral \nintegrity and welcomes the opportunity to provide an update on our efforts to address these challenges. \n\nGoogle has long been dedicated to supporting democratic processes by: \n\n●  Surfacing high-quality information to voters \n●  Safeguarding our platforms from abuse, and \n●  Equipping campaigns with best-in-class security tools and training. \n\nThese three pillars are fundamental to maintaining public trust in elections and include our platforms and services \nproviding the following: \n\n●  Google promotes information on how to vote on Google Search's landing page to increase voter awareness \n\nand democratic participation. \n\n●  YouTube prominently surfaces content from authoritative sources on the homepage, in search results, and the \n\n\"Up Next\" panel for election news and information. \n\n●  Google monitors and tackles coordinated influence operations through the Google Threat Intelligence group, \nwhich includes intelligence and threat response across Google’s Threat Analysis Group, Cloud Security and \nMandiant teams. \n\n●  For over a decade, Google has leveraged machine learning classifiers and AI to identify and remove content \n\nthat violates policies regarding manipulated media, hate and harassment, incitement to violence, and \ndemonstrably false claims that could undermine democratic processes. \n\n●  Google offers free security services like the Advanced Protection Program and Project Shield to high-risk users \nsuch as campaigners and journalists to ensure they have additional account security protections in place. \n\nAddressing AI-Related Misinformation \n\nWe understand the AEC's concerns regarding the use of AI to spread election-related misinformation and \ndisinformation, including deepfakes and coordinated inauthentic behaviour. Google has implemented several \nmeasures to mitigate these risks across our products and services: \n\n●  AI and Generative AI policies: Google has policies that address misinformation and disinformation in the \ncontext of AI.  For example, YouTube's misinformation policies prohibit technically manipulated content that \nmisleads users and could pose a serious risk of egregious harm.  \n\n Page 1 of 3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f●  Ads disclosures: Google requires advertisers to disclose when their election ads include synthetic content \nthat inauthentically depicts real or realistic-looking people or events. This policy applies to image, video, and \naudio content. Google's ads policies already prohibit the use of manipulated media to mislead people, such as \ndeep fakes or doctored content. \n\n●  Content labels on YouTube: YouTube requires creators to disclose when they've created realistic altered or \nsynthetic content and displays a label indicating that the content is synthetic. For election-related content, \nYouTube displays a prominent label on the video player for added transparency. \n\n●  Responsible approach to Generative AI products: Google has prioritised testing across safety risks, \nincluding misinformation, for Generative AI products like Gemini. Google has restricted the types of \nelection-related queries for which Gemini will return responses. \n\n●  Watermarking: Google attaches invisible watermarks to imagery generated by Google's models using \n\nSynthID, a watermarking technology developed by Google DeepMind. \n\n●  Providing users with additional context: \"About this image\" in Search helps people assess the credibility and \ncontext of images found online. The double-check feature in Gemini enables people to evaluate whether \nthere's content across the web to substantiate a Gemini response. \n\nProgress Against the Tech Accord Commitments \n\nGoogle was among the original signatories of the Tech Accord to Combat Deceptive Use of AI in 2024 Elections. In line \nwith our commitments, we have taken steps across our products to reduce the risks that deceptive AI election content \nmay pose to the integrity of electoral processes. These steps include: \n\n●  Developing Model Cards to promote transparency and a shared understanding of AI models \n●  Addressing harmful content through Google's AI Prohibited Use Policy \n●  Proactively testing systems using AI-Assisted Red Teaming \n●  Restricting responses for election-related queries across many Generative AI consumer apps and experiences \n●  Expanding the SynthID watermarking toolkit to more Generative AI tools and more forms of media \n●  Requiring election advertisers to prominently disclose when their ads include realistic synthetic content \n●  Adding Google-generated disclosures for some YouTube Election Ads formats, and \n●  Actively exploring ways to incorporate Content Credentials into our own products and services, including Ads, \n\nSearch, and YouTube, as a Steering Committee member of the C2PA Coalition and Standard. \n\nCollaboration and Transparency \n\nGoogle is committed to transparency and collaboration with industry, government, and civil society. We actively share \nour learnings and expertise with researchers and others in the industry. We engage and collaborate with organisations \nsuch as the Partnership on AI, ML Commons, and the Frontier Model Forum. We also support the Global Fact Check \nFund and numerous civil society, research, and media literacy efforts. \n\nLooking Ahead \n\nGoogle's efforts around elections are not limited to a specific timeframe or region. We will continue to support and \nprotect elections around the world and in Australia by: \n\n●  Surfacing high-quality information to voters \n●  Safeguarding our platforms from abuse \n●  Equipping campaigns with best-in-class security tools and training \n●  Applying new learnings to improve our protections for harmful content and create trustworthy experiences \n●  Leveraging machine learning classifiers and AI to identify and remove content that violates our policies, and \n●  Taking a principled and responsible approach to introducing generative AI products. \n\n Page 2 of 3 \n\n \n\f\fFrom:\nSent:\nTo:\nCc:\nSubject:\n\nHi \n\n, \n\nMonday, 9 December 2024 10:36 AM\n\nRE: Action items from October meeting, including proposed dates for December \nmeeting [SEC=OFFICIAL]\n\nThanks for your reply.

I thought it \nwould be good to follow up on a few action items from our last meeting before December arrives, as \nfollows. \n\nInformation session \n\n \n\n- at our last meeting you kindly offered to set up an information quality session to outline how \nGoogle search worked, including an element on searches in Gemini. We would like to take you up \non that offer.  \n\no  Please let me know what time frames/notice you need to set this up and I would be happy \n\nto set up some meeting invites \n\no  If we work a couple of weeks in advance, most of our working level attendees will be free to \n\nattend \n\nGemini’s incorrect answer about enrolling to vote \n\n \n\n- on 23 October we flagged that Gemini was producing an incorrect answer to the question \n“Can I be enrolled to vote if I haven’t completed and enrolment form?”. It appears that Gemini \nnow declines to respond this prompt, instead providing the scripted answer in relation to not \nbeing able to help with elections. I’m not sure if this is based on action you have taken in the \nbackground, if so, thanks and noted! \n\n  For a gold star from us it would be great if Gemini provided a link to the AEC’s website when \n\nAustralian users submit queries about elections, although there is some nuance to this given we \nhave state electoral management bodies to consider too. We also understand these things are not \nalways as easy as they sound. Happy to discuss at our next meeting if this is something you think \ncould be pursued. \n\nNext meeting - December 2024 \n\n  At our last meeting on 23 October, it was agreed it would be useful to set up a post US election \n\nmeeting before we all break for Christmas. Available times in December include: \n\no  Monday, 16 December                   9.30am to 11.00am \no  Monday, 16 December                   1pm to 2pm \n\n3\n\ns47Fs47Fs47Fs47F \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n\fo  Tuesday, 17 December                   1pm to 2pm \no  Wednesday, 18 December            9.30am to 10.30am \no  Wednesday, 18 December            1pm to 2pm \no  Friday, 20 December                       9.30am to 12pm \no  Friday, 20 December                       1pm to 2pm \n\nNo problem if this is not a good week in the lead up to Christmas, just give me a steer on a better \nweek and I’ll consult calendars accordingly. \n\n  We will send out an agenda prior the next meeting but note the following from our last meeting. \n\no \n\no \n\n offered to brief on Google’s approach to AI in elections after gaining insight from \n\nthe US presidential election on 5 November \n\n offered to provide more information about how content provenance works on \n\ncontent uploaded to YouTube at next meeting \n\no  Google and YouTube to provide information and insights into Sovereign Citizen promotion \n\nof misinformation/disinformation respective platforms \n\no  Google and YouTube support for the next Australian federal election \no  AEC to share trends in the election information environment with Google and YouTube \n\nLastly, no doubt you are already aware of the Electoral Legislation Amendment (Electoral Reform) Bill \n2024 currently being considered. In case you are not already aware, there is a proposed amendment to \nsection 348 (Control of behaviour at polling booths etc.) of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 that \nprovides: \n\n(1A) A person commits an offence if:  \n\n(a)          the person makes an audio or video recording in premises to which this section \napplies; and \n\n(b)          the recording is made without the permission of the person in charge of the \npremises; and  \n\n(c)           the making of the recording constitutes a contravention of paragraph 348(1)(a); \nand  \n\n(d)          the person:  \n\n(i)            publishes the whole or a part of the recording; or  \n\n(ii)           causes to be published the whole or a part of the recording.  \n\nPenalty: 5 penalty units. \n\n4\n\ns47Fs47F  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n\fEssentially, it will be an offence to get your phone out and video or audio record in a polling place or \ncounting centre and post it online without the permission of the officer in charge. Some of the content \nposted online that the AEC was concerned about during past events would be covered by this if/when it \nenacted. Flagging now ahead of our next meeting for discussion. \n\nApologies for the lengthy email.

The Australian Electoral Commission has appreciated the productive \nengagement we’ve had with Google in the past, and while the date for the next Australian federal \nelection is yet to be determined by the government, we are keeping a close eye on developments in this \n‘year of elections’ around the world, particularly advancements in generative AI technology. \n\nWith that in mind, we are very interested in meeting with representatives from Google’s AI team to \nlearn more about the following:  \n\n Any observations and lessons learned from recent elections around the globe and how \nthese experiences are shaping your work on generative AI; \n\n How Google is responding to electoral integrity risks when it comes to generative AI \nproducts like Gemini, with a particular focus on how we can ensure the Australian public has \naccess to timely and accurate information about the electoral process; \n\n A brief overview of SynthID including how it identifies AI-generated content; \n\n Discussing pathways for the Elecoral Integrity Assurance Taskforce (EIAT) and the AEC to flag \npotential issues with you in relation to Australian federal electoral events and AI products like \nGemini, and whether this would differ from our existing pathway. \n\nAny assistance you can provide in directing us to the relevant teams to meet with would be much \nappreciated.  \n\nKind regards,  \n\n | Senior Project Officer  \n\nDefending Democracy Unit | Electoral Integrity and Media Branch \n\nAustralian Electoral Commission \n\nT: \n\nDISCLAIMER: \n\nIf you have received this transmission in error please notify us immediately by return email and delete all \ncopies.
