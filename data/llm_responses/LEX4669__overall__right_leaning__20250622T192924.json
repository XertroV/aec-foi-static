            "text": "These FOI documents reveal communications between the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) and \"Advance Australia\" (via \"Referendum News\") regarding compliance with authorisation requirements for referendum-related advertisements, specifically paid Facebook posts. The core issue revolves around the meticulous enforcement of Section 110C of the Referendum (Machinery Provisions) Act 1984 and the Commonwealth Electoral (Authorisation of Voter Communication) Determination 2021.\n\n**Economic Efficiency:** The extensive back-and-forth correspondence, including multiple emails, phone calls, extensions for compliance, and detailed guidance, highlights a significant bureaucratic process. This suggests an inefficient allocation of resources. Both the government agency (AEC) and the private entity (Advance Australia) are expending considerable time and effort navigating complex regulations regarding the format and placement of authorisation notices. This administrative burden detracts from the productive use of resources for both the government and private advocacy groups, indicating a system that is not optimally efficient.\n\n**Individual Liberty:** The documents demonstrate the government's stringent control over political communication, even in the realm of paid advertisements. Requiring specific authorisation details for all referendum matter, and dictating *how* this information must be displayed (e.g., specific text at the end of a communication or a URL to a webpage), represents a notable intrusion into the free expression of individuals and organizations. While framed as transparency, this level of detailed regulation can be seen as burdensome and potentially stifling to political speech. The AEC's guidance of \"when in doubt, authorise it\" could lead to a chilling effect, where groups self-censor or over-comply to avoid penalties, thereby limiting the scope of public discourse.\n\n**Fiscal Responsibility:** The sheer volume of communications, involvement of the AEC's \"Legal Services Branch\" and \"Chief Legal Officer,\" and the iterative process of ensuring compliance underscore a substantial expenditure of taxpayer funds. These resources are dedicated to monitoring, notifying, and enforcing granular regulations on political advertising. From a fiscal responsibility standpoint, this raises questions about whether such intensive oversight of communication minutiae represents the most prudent use of public money, particularly when compared to other core government functions.\n\n**Limited Government:** The AEC's actions, as revealed in these documents, reflect an expansive view of government's role in regulating public debate. The detailed rules for authorisation, the distinction between various communication formats, and the active policing of compliance demonstrate a government agency extending its authority deep into the private sphere of political advocacy. This level of intervention goes beyond merely facilitating elections and moves towards actively shaping and controlling the terms and presentation of political speech, which deviates from the principle of limited government that prioritizes individual autonomy and minimizes state interference in civic life. The government's deep involvement in specifying how private organizations must communicate about public matters illustrates an overreach that can crowd out the spontaneous order of a free society."

Please advise if you require more time to comply.\nIn relation to your question about the Referendum News Facebook page Ad Library\n(facebook.com), if the communications are paid-for by a disclosure entity and the content\nexpressly promoting or/and opposing the law are referendum matter they require an\nauthorisation under section 110C(1)(a), (c) and (5) of the Referendum (Machinery\nProvisions) Act 1984 (Referendum Act). The AEC considers the communications currently\non the Referendum New page include paid ads containing referendum matter that expressly\npromoting or opposing the law. These communications therefore require authorisation.\nSection 12 of the Commonwealth Electoral (Authorisation of Voter Communication)\nDetermination 2021 sets out the notifying particulars of the authorisation for communications\nother than printed communications. Section 12(2)(d) states if the communication is\ncommunicated in a form other than a form mentioned in paragraph (a), (b) or (c)—in one or\nmore of the following ways:\n\n(i) at the end of the communication; or\n\n(ii) on a webpage that can be accessed by a URL that is included, either in\n\nwhole or as a hyperlink, at the end of the communication;\n\nIf Advance Australia (via Referendum News) is unable to insert a URL/hyperlink into the\nimage of your paid advertisements, the AEC would accept the placement of an authorisation\nin a paid advertisement at the end of the communication. For example:\n\nIf communicating about the proposed referendum, the AEC’s general guidance is – ‘when in\ndoubt, authorise it’.\nIf you are active in campaigning, receiving donations or making donations for a referendum,\nyou may have an obligation to disclose amounts received or spent on referendum matter.\nMore information is available on the AEC website at Referendum disclosure.\nI trust that this information is of assistance. Please note that the above information is not to\n\ns 47Fs 47Fs 47Fs 47F\n\n\n--- Page 2 ---\n\nbe considered legal advice.\nKind regards,\n\nRegulatory Law | Legal Services Branch\nAustralian Electoral Commission\nThis email may contain legal advice that is subject to legal professional privilege.
