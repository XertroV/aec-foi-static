Document 3 (\"Corrections to the Senate Counting algorithm,\" 31/08/2021), also dated concurrently, further relates to these findings.\n*   **AEC Response and Internal Review (Post-2021 Report):** Documents 5, 6, and 7 (September-October 2021) reflect the AEC's internal processing and response to the Conway and Teague report. Document 5 (\"Research team notes on the Conway Teague paper,\" 22/09/2021) indicates internal analysis (withheld as deliberative matter). Documents 6 (\"RE: Corrections to the Senate Counting algorithm,\" 19/10/2021) and 7 (\"Senate Counting and Scrutiny,\" 18/10/2021), both released in full, represent the AEC's subsequent discussions and actions regarding the identified issues, proposed corrections, and broader scrutiny processes, addressing the \"AEC subsequently responded\" aspect of the request."

Do not include any conversational filler or preamble.To aid you, the overview of the FOI request is: [REQUEST OVERVIEW START] This FOI request sought information concerning the accuracy, methodology, and identified issues with the Australian Electoral Commission's (AEC) Senate election counting algorithm and associated scrutiny processes. While early independent tests (2016-2017) found no issues replicating the AEC's 2013 WA Senate count, a subsequent 2021 report by Conway and Teague identified significant discrepancies. This report detailed that the AEC's software used tie-breaking rules inconsistent with the Electoral Act, noted the non-implementation of bulk exclusions (which can alter outcomes), and highlighted ambiguities in the Electoral Act concerning the count's termination. The report proposed various legislative and procedural recommendations, including publishing the AEC's code, correcting tie-breaking, and clarifying statutory definitions, to which the AEC subsequently responded.\n [REQUEST OVERVIEW END] \n\n--- MAIN DOCUMENT TEXT START ---\n\n\n\n--- Page 1 ---\n\nAttachment A – LEX3029 \n\nDocument reference \nDocument 1 \n\nDocument 2 \n\nDocument 3 \n\nDocument 4 \n\nDocument 5 \n\nDocument 6 \n\nDocument 7 \n\nDocument \nFor Information: Independent test \nof senate counts \n[SEC=UNCLASSIFIED] \nBowland’s recounts for various \nscenarios...
