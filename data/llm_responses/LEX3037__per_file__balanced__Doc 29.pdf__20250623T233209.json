The post incorrectly stated April 7 as an enrolment deadline, which the AEC notes could mislead and potentially disenfranchise young voters, as the actual cut-off date had not yet been announced.\n2.  The account in question was not authorised.\nThe AEC requested the recipient's attention to these issues, offering further information.\n\n**Relevance to FOI Request LEX3037:**\nThis document is highly relevant to FOI request LEX3037, as it provides a concrete example of the \"correspondence from early 2022 between the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) and major tech companies... regarding compliance with electoral law and the 2022 federal election.\" It directly demonstrates the \"AEC's proactive engagement—primarily through its Electoral Integrity Assurance Taskforce—with these platforms.\" Specifically, it showcases the AEC's process of \"identifying, monitoring, and addressing electoral misinformation... and non-compliant content through direct communication channels and content referrals,\" in line with safeguarding election integrity as detailed in the FOI request overview."
