The party contends this drastic reduction is illogical without a clerical error and notes a lack of detailed breakdown for the second list's assessment, suggesting a less rigorous process.

Do not include any conversational filler or preamble.To aid you, the overview of the FOI request is: [REQUEST OVERVIEW START] The FOI request (LEX3070) sought applications made to the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) under s 141(2) of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 during early 2022, concerning reviews of party registration and deregistration decisions. The released documents, primarily communications and a detailed statistical analysis, reveal a strong theme of challenges to the AEC's administrative processes. Key content includes multiple parties (e.g., Democratic Labour Party, Flux, Health Australia Party) arguing that the AEC's party membership verification methodology is statistically flawed, unfair, and results in arbitrary deregistration outcomes, with Flux providing extensive analysis asserting the method is \"rigged.\" Additional challenges include the Australian Progressives alleging a clerical error in their deregistration, an objection to the registration of the David Pocock party based on candidate eligibility and name consistency, and an objection to the Australian Federation Party's logo for potential voter confusion.\n [REQUEST OVERVIEW END] \n\n--- MAIN DOCUMENT TEXT START ---\n\n\n\n--- Page 1 ---\n\nMr Tom Rogers\nAustralian Electoral Commissioner\nLocked Bag 4007, Canberra City ACT 2601\ncommission.secretariat@aec.gov.au\n\nDear Mr Rogers,\n\nI am writing to request an urgent internal review of the AEC’s decision to deregister the Australian Progressives,\nas notified in the letter received on the 16th of March.\n\nWhen reading through the reasoning given for deregistration, it became clear that some sort of clerical error has\noccurred with the validation of the second member list that was submitted on February 11th 2022. In the\nBreakdown of the first member list submitted on December 8th, the AEC was able to match 1475 members. The\nsecond member list submitted on February 11, was an amended version of that same list - with insufficient\namendments to justify a 1290 person drop in match rate - from 96% on the December 8 list, to 12% on the\nFebruary 11 list.\n\nWe also note that there is a more substantial breakdown of the December 8 list, with members being manually\nmatched, as well as the identification of 13 deceased members. The lack of a similar breakdown in the response\nto our February 11 submission suggests that the process has not been followed with the same level of rigour.\n\nIt is apparent that some form of clerical error has occurred in the AEC’s assessment of our membership list which\nwas submitted on the 11th of February - there is no other reasonable explanation for such a significant drop in\nthe number of members matched to the electoral roll.\n\nWe request that this matter is addressed urgently as the Federal election is due to be called within weeks - and\nthis error has put our ability to contest the election at risk. In addition, the Party risks reputational damage as a\nresult of this error, so we would appreciate prompt action to resolve it.\n\nWe are confident that we have over the 1500 required members to remain registered, as a reflection of our\nteam’s dedication to cleaning the list and verifying information, and believe that investigation of this clerical\nerror will support this confidence.\n\nRegards,\n\nEdward Carroll\nRegistered Officer\nAustralian Progressives\n42 Messara Circuit\nDURACK QLD 4077\n\nedward.carroll@progressives.org.au\n\nwww.progressives.org.au\n\nLEX3070 Released Document No. 911Released under the Freedom of Information Act 1982\n\n\n--- Page 2 ---\n\n1. \n\n2. \n\n3. \n\n4. \n\n5. \n\n6. \n\n7. \n\n8. \n\n9. \n\n10. \n\n11. \n\n12. \n\n13. \n\n14. \n\n15. \n\n16. \n\n17. \n\n18. \n\n19. \n\n20. \n\n21. \n\n22. \n\n23. \n\n24. \n\n25. \n\n26. \n\n27. \n\n28. \n\n29. \n\nREDACTION CODES \n\nPersonal Information (name) redacted. \n\nPersonal Information (date of birth) redacted. \n\nPersonal Information (place of birth) redacted \n\nPersonal Information (citizenship) redacted. \n\nPersonal Information (racial or ethnic origin) redacted. \n\nPersonal Information (photograph) redacted \n\nPersonal Information (facsimile of signature) redacted. \n\nPersonal Information (facsimile of manuscript initialling) redacted. \n\nPersonal Information (Individual’s address) redacted. \n\nPersonal Information (Individual’s email address) redacted. \n\nPersonal Information (individual’s telephone number or mobile number) \nredacted. \n\nPersonal Information (individual’s political opinion) redacted. \n\nPersonal Information (opinion about individual) redacted. \n\nPersonal Information (Individuals current or former occupation). \n\nPersonal Information (employment history) redacted. \n\nPersonal Information (qualifications) redacted. \n\nPersonal Information (membership of a professional or trade association). \n\nPersonal Information (membership of a trade union). \n\nPersonal Information (health) redacted. \n\nPersonal Information (membership of a political association) redacted \n\nPersonal Information (religious beliefs or affiliations) redacted. \n\nPersonal Information (sexual orientation or practices). \n\nPersonal Information (criminal record). \n\nPersonal Information (identifying individual) redacted. \n\nPersonal Information (bank account details) redacted) \n\nBusiness information (bank account details) redacted. \n\nBusiness information (billing account details) redacted. \n\nBusiness information (ureasonably affect a person adversely in respect of his \nor her lawful business or professional affairs) redacted. \n\nBusiness Information (reasonably be expected to prejudice the future supply \nof information to the Commonwealth or an agency for the purpose of the \nadministration of a law of the Commonwealth or of a Territory or the \nadministration of matters administered by an agency). \n\n30. \n\nBusiness information (trade secret).\n\n\n--- Page 3 ---\n\n31. \n\n32. \n\n33. \n\n34. \n\n35. \n\n36. \n\n37. \n\n38. \n\nBusiness information (information having a commercial value that would be, \nor could reasonably be expected to be, destroyed or diminished if the \ninformation were disclosed). \n\nLegal Professional Communication redacted. \n\nDeliberative material redacted. \n\nElectoral Roll material redacted. \n\nTests, examinations or audits material redacted. \n\nManagement or assessment of personnel material redacted. \n\nProper and efficient conduct of the operations of AEC material redacted. \n\nLawful methods or procedures for preventing, detecting, investigating, or \ndealing with matters arising out of, breaches or evasions of the law redactged \n\n39. \n\nIrrelevant material redacted.\n\n"
