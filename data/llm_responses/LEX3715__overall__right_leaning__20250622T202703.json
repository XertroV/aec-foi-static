            "text": "The Freedom of Information (FOI) documents requested by Cory Harding reveal concerning aspects of the Australian Electoral Commission's (AEC) operations, particularly when viewed through the lens of conservative principles such as economic efficiency, individual liberty, national security (electoral integrity), fiscal responsibility, and limited government. A predominant theme throughout the documents is a significant lack of transparency, with numerous requests for access to key financial and operational data being refused or heavily redacted.\n\n**Fiscal Responsibility and Economic Efficiency:**\nThe documents raise serious questions about the AEC's financial management and the efficient allocation of taxpayer funds. Document 24 reveals the AEC reported a **$24.5 million loss** in 2021-22 and faces \"ongoing challenges\" and \"significant risk\" with its funding model, indicating a lack of fiscal discipline and potential operational unsustainability.\n\nSignificant expenditure is highlighted, such as **$75.1 million** over two years for preparatory work on the First Nations Voice to Parliament Referendum (Doc 22), with $50.2 million directly to the AEC for preparations and an *additional* $16.1 million specifically for \"First Nations enrolment and participation.\" This pre-emptive and targeted spending for a single event, alongside **$160 million** already in the Contingency Reserve, suggests potential overspending and a lack of restraint in discretionary government expenditure.\n\nTravel expenses (Doc 27) jumped from **$1.5-1.6 million** in non-election years to **$5.393 million** in 2021-22, and while some increase is expected, the justification includes \"networking with international partners and supporting reform agendas in other countries,\" which may be seen as mission creep beyond core electoral functions and potentially inefficient use of funds. The **$19 million** spent on the 2022 federal election public information campaign (Doc 62), including \"Stop and Consider (disinformation) messaging,\" also warrants scrutiny for its scale and scope, particularly given its **exemption from standard government advertising review processes**, which undermines accountability.\n\nThe documents also reveal the considerable cost of extensive COVID-19 safety measures, with an acknowledgment of \"spent costs\" if restrictions eased (Doc 37.2), raising concerns about proportionality and adaptability in spending during a dynamic environment.\n\n**Individual Liberty:**\nThe AEC's stance on **voter verification (ID)** is a notable deviation from a common conservative tenet (Doc 47). The AEC explicitly states that voter ID \"is not required\" by law and warns it would lead to \"increased costs,\" \"longer queue times,\" and potentially \"impact voter enfranchisement.\" This position prioritizes administrative ease over perceived security and integrity, which for conservatives, is a crucial element of safeguarding the individual's vote. The AEC's argument that voter ID \"does not eliminate the possibility of administrative errors\" is a weak justification against a measure widely seen as enhancing electoral integrity.\n\nConversely, the significant increase in **early and postal voting** (Doc 38), now comprising over 50% of votes, while presented as ensuring \"fair and equitable access,\" can be viewed as potentially diluting the traditional civic act of voting on a single election day, and its higher administrative cost (Doc 39) impacts efficiency. The AEC's targeted \"investments in partnerships and activities\" and \"targeted advertising campaigns\" for \"First Nations enrolment and participation\" (Doc 28.2), while aiming to increase participation, could be interpreted as government intervention designed to influence specific demographics, potentially overstepping the bounds of merely facilitating access for all.\n\n**National Security (Electoral Integrity):**\nThe documents reveal several areas of concern regarding the integrity of the electoral process, which is fundamental to national security. The **heavy reliance on postal voting** (Doc 39), which saw 2.7 million issued in 2022, comes with acknowledged \"resource intensive\" counting processes and vulnerabilities. The fact that political parties provided 61% of paper postal vote applications, some with \"significant changes to the approved PVA artwork\" or \"incorrect return address[es],\" raises red flags about external influence and potential for error. The rejection of **176,880 postal votes** (79.2% for lacking elector or witness signatures) indicates substantial issues in the process or voter compliance.\n\nAdministrative errors were also noted, such as the combining of ballot papers across different pre-poll counts in Cowper (Doc 50), which, while claimed to have \"no impact on the results,\" erodes public trust. The **denial of a recount request in Gilmore** despite a close margin (373 votes) and candidate concerns (Doc 68) can also fuel skepticism about the thoroughness of the counting process. The discovery of \"discarded ballot papers\" in Port Macquarie (Doc 69), even if initially attributed to voter error, highlights a lapse in ballot paper security and adds to integrity concerns.\n\nThe AEC's limited role in verifying **candidate qualifications** (Doc 48), treating the checklist as a \"self-assessment tool\" and deferring eligibility to the High Court, creates an \"honour system\" that can lead to costly post-election legal challenges and undermines the integrity of elected officials from the outset. Furthermore, allegations of **call centre staff providing false voting information** (Doc 51), while unverified by the AEC due to data limitations, underscore a critical integrity weakness in information dissemination.\n\nThe significant investment in **polling place technology (ECLs)** (Doc 46), costing $24.4 million, is aimed at preventing multiple voting, which aligns with integrity, but the cost-benefit of such technological solutions needs careful scrutiny. Similarly, the use of **scanning and software (EasyCount – Senate)** for Senate counting (Docs 44.2, 45), while efficient, relies on non-public source code for \"commercial capacity\" reasons, limiting full public scrutiny and potentially raising concerns about the transparency of the counting process itself.\n\n**Limited Government:**\nA core conservative principle is limited government intervention and high transparency. The overwhelming number of **refused or heavily redacted documents** in the initial FOI request (pages 1-10 of the FOI schedule), covering financial matters, procurements, and integrity, is a significant blow to transparency and accountability. This lack of openness impedes public oversight of government operations.\n\nThe AEC's involvement in a **\"Stop and Consider (disinformation) messaging\" campaign** (Doc 62) raises concerns about government overreach into influencing public discourse and potentially infringing on free speech, rather than strictly administering elections. The exemption of this campaign from standard government advertising review processes further exacerbates concerns about the lack of independent oversight. The explicit inclusion of \"climate change impacts\" into \"value for money\" assessments for procurements (Doc 49) signals an expansion of government policy into areas beyond its core electoral function, potentially leading to less efficient, politically driven spending rather than purely economic decisions.\n\nIn conclusion, these FOI documents, particularly through their extensive redactions and the details they do reveal, present a picture of an electoral commission grappling with significant financial challenges, making substantial and sometimes questionable expenditures, while exhibiting a concerning lack of transparency and a cautious stance on measures that could bolster electoral integrity like voter ID. This collectively points to deviations from core conservative principles of fiscal responsibility, economic efficiency, robust electoral integrity, and limited, transparent government."

\n\n•\n\n•\n\n•\n\nAs part of the October 2022-23 Budget, the Government provided various agencies\n$75.1 million over two years from 2022–23 as part of the Delivery of a First Nations Voice to\nParliament Referendum – preparatory work measure to prepare for the delivery of a\nreferendum to enshrine a First Nations Voice to Parliament in the Constitution.\n\nThe AEC component of the measure funding is reflected in the Appropriation Bill 1 2022-23,\nand includes:\n\no $50.2 million in 2022–23 to the Australian Electoral Commission to commence\n\npreparations and support work to deliver the referendum.\n\no $16.1 million over two years from 2022–23 to the Australian Electoral Commission\nto increase First Nations enrolment and participation in future electoral events\n\nThis

the AEC reported a loss on continuing operations of\n\n$24.5 million compared to an operating surplus of $47.9 million in 2020-21.\n\n• The AEC’s range of electoral activities is subject to external factors which\n\n•\n\ncan impact the timing of our expenditure. Consequently, our operating result\ncan fluctuate significantly from year to year.\nThe AEC’s current funding model continues to present an ongoing challenge\nand poses significant risk in managing increasingly complex electoral events\nand the ongoing growth of the electoral roll.\n\nBranch \nContact \n\nFinance and Corporate Performance \nSally So, Chief Financial Officer \n\nUpdated \nPrinted \n\n20/01/2023 8:56 AM \n20/01/2023 8:56 AM \n\nLEX3715 Released Document23\n\n\n--- Page 4 ---\n\nNo: 24 \n\nPage 2 of 2 \n\nLEX3715 Released Document23\n\n\n--- Page 5 ---\n\nNo: 25 \n\nVENDORS, PROCUREMENTS AND MAJOR TENDERS \n\nCommissioner’s summary \n\nIssue \n\nPosition \n\nStatus and timing of major AEC procurements and tenders published on \nAusTender over the 2022–23 financial year. \n\nThe AEC has undertaken extensive preparation and planning to have relevant \nprocurement processes and contracts in place for the next federal election or \nreferendum event.  \n\nThe AEC engages a number of suppliers to deliver some key supporting elements \nthat assist in the AEC’s delivery of federal electoral events.

The\n\nDecember 2022 estimate is a national Indigenous enrolment rate of 84.5 per cent.\n\n• The Indigenous enrolment rate has grown consistently from 74.7 per cent in 2017 to\n\n84.5 per cent in December 2022.\n\n• While any gap between non-Indigenous and Indigenous enrolment rates is disappointing, it is\n\nencouraging to see that estimated Indigenous enrolment rates have been increasing over time.\n\n• The AEC is also undertaking considerable work to improve the effectiveness of its FDEU direct\n\nenrolment program for First Nations people.\n\n- Three trial activities were completed in the second half of 2022 which added an estimated\n\n15,500 First Nations people to the roll. In light of trial outcomes, changes to the\nmainstream FDEU program have been adopted and we expect this to lead to further\nincreases in the Indigenous enrolment rate.\n\n- One further trial activity will commence in February 2023.\n\n• As part of the Enhancing Indigenous Electoral Participation project, the AEC ran the first\nphase of a targeted enrolment advertising campaign in November/December 2022, with a\nfurther phase planned in the first half of 2023.\n\n• The AEC’s Indigenous Electoral Participation Program is also working to support electoral\nparticipation of First Nations peoples through establishing partnerships, working with State and\nTerritory agencies to undertake remote enrolment work, and delivering targeted and culturally\nappropriate services and information.\n\n• The AEC is currently expanding and enhancing its remote polling services to offer an improved\n\nlevel of service in more locations.\n\nPage 2 of 40 \n\nLEX3715 Released Document No. 26Released under the Freedom of Information Act 1982\n\n\n--- Page 16 ---\n\nNo: 28.2 \n\nIndigenous enrolment estimates \n\nCommissioner’s summary \n\nIssue \n\nPosition \n\nPoints \n\nDespite steady increases, there is still a gap between the national enrolment rates \nand the estimated Indigenous enrolment rate. \nWhile any gap between non-Indigenous and Indigenous enrolment rates is \ndisappointing, it is encouraging to see that estimated enrolment rates for First \nNations Australians are increasing over time. \nHeadlines \n\n• Updated AEC estimates show that an additional 21,000 Indigenous Australians\n\nhave enrolled to vote between the end of June 2022 to the end December 2022,\nbringing the national estimated Indigenous enrolment rate up to 84.5% (up\n2.8%).\n\n• The rapid rise easily represents the largest increase since estimates were first\n\ncalculated in this manner by the AEC in 2017.\n\n• We continue to work really hard in getting as many people to enrol as possible,\nwith a particular focus on young Australians and Indigenous Australians who\naren’t enrolled at as high a rate as others.\n\n• The AEC’s recent direct enrolment trials are proving successful. Remote\n\nengagement work through AEC staff and 80+ community partners is having an\nimpact and recent Indigenous enrolment communication campaigns are helping\nto achieve the continued enrolment rise as well.\n\n• The estimated number of ‘unenrolled’ Indigenous Australians has gone under\n\n100,000 for the first time – to just under 87,000 – and that is significant.\n\nStats \n\n• As at 31 December 2022, the estimated Indigenous enrolment rate is 84.5 per\n\ncent.\n\n• This is the highest level of estimated Indigenous enrolment ever achieved,\n\nhowever there is more work required to achieve parity.\n\n• The rate is increasing in every state and territory.\n\n• Continuous growth has seen the estimated enrolment rate increase from 74.7\n\nper cent in June 2017 to 84.5 per cent in December 2022.\n\n• The estimated number of eligible Indigenous people not enrolled has decreased\n\nby 30 per cent since June 2017.\n\n• These enrolment gains have significantly outpaced the growth of the national\n\nelectoral roll.\n\nQuestion: What advice has AEC provided to Government on Indigenous \nenrolment? \n\n• Answer: Annual rates at 30 June have been published since 2017.\n\nPage 3 of 40 \n\nLEX3715 Released Document No. 26Released under the Freedom of Information Act 1982\n\n\n--- Page 17 ---\n\nNo: 28.2 \n\nPage 4 of 40 \n\nLEX3715 Released Document No. 2623Released under the Freedom of Information Act 1982\n\n\n--- Page 18 ---\n\nNo: 28.2 \n\nPage 5 of 40 \n\nLEX3715 Released Document No. 2623Released under the Freedom of Information Act 1982\n\n\n--- Page 19 ---\n\nNo: 28.2 \n\nPage 6 of 40 \n\nLEX3715 Released Document No. 2623Released under the Freedom of Information Act 1982\n\n\n--- Page 20 ---\n\nNo: 36.2 \n\nREFERENDUM PREPAREDNESS \n\nCommissioner’s summary \n\nIssue \n\nPreparedness for a referendum in 2023. \n\nPosition \n\nThe AEC is an independent statutory authority and is responsible for the \nmachinery of the referendum only.

As such, planning was\nundertaken on the basis of existing legislation, accounting for potential\nchanges in voting patterns. This included the Contingency Measures Act which\nenabled the Electoral Commissioner to make limited operational modifications\nby legislative instrument where an emergency declaration was in place under\na Commonwealth law and the COVID Enfranchisement Act 2022, which\nexpanded telephone voting to provide contingency for electors in mandatory\nisolation or quarantine due to COVID-19.\n\n• Risk: The AEC actively engaged with stakeholders and vendors to understand\nthe requirements to deliver an election with COVID-19 safety measures. This\nincluded managing health risks and from a materials perspective, issues with\nsupplier procurement and lead times, product availability, and the resultant\ncost impacts. The AEC had a dedicated response unit to actively monitor the\nCOVID-19 environment including the changing nature of the pandemic in each\njurisdiction and the impact on and response required for the election. We\ndeveloped contingency plans to respond to evolving conditions.\n\n• Staff: Additional staff were engaged in polling places and counting centres to\nmanage voter queues, perform touch point cleaning, and undertake vote\nissuing and counting to ensure physical distancing was maintained where\npossible. All staff engaged for the federal election were required to be\nvaccinated and wear masks.\n\nTalking points \n\nQuestion: Was the AEC prepared to deliver an election if there was a snap lockdown announced \nduring the polling period?  \n\n• Our planning and delivery models were designed to allow the AEC to be agile and respond to a\n\nchanging environment, particularly during this time.\n\n• The AEC actively worked through additional contingency planning to maximise the availability\n\nof voting services for all Australians.\n\n• The AEC worked to the advice provided by federal and local health authorities.\n• The AEC had contingencies in place to deliver an election should there be additional\n\nrestrictions in place during polling in one or more locations. This included deployment of\nadditional Personal Protective Equipment to polling places as necessary, as well as funds set\naside for additional cleaning of premises.\n\nBranch \nContact \n\nDelivery and Support Branch \nNatasha Scandrett, Assistant Commissioner \n\nUpdated \nPrinted \n\n23/01/2023 \n23/01/2023 8:38 AM \n\nLEX3715 Released DocumentReleased under the Freedom of Information Act 1982\n\n\n--- Page 24 ---\n\nNo: 37.2 \n\nQuestion: The vaccine rollout allowed for restrictions to be eased. Was the AEC concerned that \ntaxpayers’ money would be wasted on resources that were no longer needed? \n\n• Advice from the Department of Health was that COVID-19 safety measures would likely need\n\nto remain in place in some form for the foreseeable future.\n\n• Given the AEC had been ready to deliver an election since August 2021, there were some\nspent costs. If restrictions had been significantly reduced the AEC would have looked to\nachieve savings where possible without jeopardising the safety of the public.\n\nPage 2 of 2 \n\nLEX3715 Released Document23Released under the Freedom of Information Act 1982\n\n\n--- Page 25 ---\n\nNo: 38 \n\nEARLY VOTING \n\nCommissioner’s summary \n\nIssue \nPosition \n\nPoints \n\nThe rise in early voting. \nEarly voting is important in ensuring fair and equitable access to voting services. \nUnder the Electoral Act, Australian voters have a range of voting options, and \nmore than ever before they are exercising the right to cast their ballot before \nelection day. \nThe Electoral Legislation Amendment (Counting, Scrutiny and Operational \nEfficiencies) Act 2021 reduced the period by which early voting can occur, with \nearliest days declared for early voting to not be earlier than 12 days before \nelection day. \n•\n\nIn person early voting continues to rise. It now makes up more than 36 per\ncent of all votes counted.\n\n• Pre-poll ordinary voting was approximately 5.07 million votes, an increase of\n\naround 18 per cent on 2019 (4.29 million votes).\n\n• The increase between the 2016 and 2019 election was approximately 57 per\n\ncent.\n\n• Approximately 583,000 pre-poll declaration votes in envelopes were received,\n\ndown 10 per cent on 2019.\n\n• Postal votes increased significantly with approximately 2.39 million returned,\n\ncompared to approximately 1.29 million at 2019.\n\n• Due to the pandemic, and based on advice from health authorities, there was\na reduced mobile polling service for the 2022 federal election, with those\nvoters unable to be serviced by mobile polling voting either by postal vote, at\nan early voting centre, or at a polling place on election day.\n\nBranch \nContact \n\nDelivery and Support Branch \nNatasha Scandrett, A/g Assistant Commissioner \n\nUpdated \nPrinted \n\n23/01/2023 \n23/01/2023 8:40 AM \n\nLEX3715 Released DocumentReleased under the Freedom of Information Act 1982\n\n\n--- Page 26 ---\n\nLEX3715 Released  Document No. 36 \n\nNo:  38 \n\nKey statistics \n\nEarly voting - 2022 FE \n\n• More than 7.9 million early votes at the 2022 federal election\n•\n51.34% of votes were early votes, up from 41.56% in 2019\n•\nIncludes pre-eoll and eostal votes, teleehone votes and mobile eolling\n\nPre-�oll and �ostal voting \nHoR votes counted \n\n• Total earlv votes\n• Percentaae of all votes cast\n\nVote type \n\n• Pre-poll votes\n\n• Postal votes\n\nTele�hone voting \n\n• Secure telephone votes (HoR)\n• Blind and Low Vision\n• Antarctic\n\nMobile �olling (all mobile �olling) \n\n• Mobile polling teams\n•\nLocations visited\n• Votes taken\n\nRemote Area Mobile  Polling \n\n• RAMP teams\n\n7,836,528 (6,153,957 in 2019) \n50.68% (40.79% in 2019) \n\n4,906,787 in 2019 (32.52%)\n\n5,626,120 (36.39% of total votes) \n-\n2,210,408 (14.30% of total votes) \n-\n1,247,170 in 2019 (8.27%)\n\n75,366 \n2,747 (2,043 in 2019) \n65 \n\n111 \n456 \n22,552 ordinary votes taken (HoR) \n-\n\n114,092 in 2019\n\n38 teams visited 348 remote locations \n\nPage 2 of 4 \n\nReleased under the Freedom of Information Act 1982\n\n\n--- Page 27 ---\n\nNo: 38 \n\nPage 3 of 4 \n\nLEX3715 Released Document23Released under the Freedom of Information Act 1982\n\n\n--- Page 28 ---\n\nNo: 38 \n\nPage 4 of 4 \n\nLEX3715 Released Document23Released under the Freedom of Information Act 1982\n\n\n--- Page 29 ---\n\nNo: 39 \n\nPOSTAL VOTING \n\nCommissioner’s summary \n\nIssue \n\nThe integrity and management of postal voting in Australia. \n\nPosition \n\nThe AEC has absolute confidence in the integrity of the postal voting processes \nused in federal elections. \n\nPoints \n\n• Postal Voting is governed by Part XV of the Commonwealth Electoral Act\n\n1918.\n\n• The integrity of postal voting is achieved through managing which votes are\n\nadmitted to the count.\n\n• Counting postal votes is resource intensive and takes more time than counting\n\n•\n\nordinary votes.\nLegislative changes passed by the Parliament in 2021 provide contingencies\nand operational efficiencies to improve postal voting services and capacity.\nThese include:\n\no modernising the design of postal voting envelopes\no allowing postal envelopes to be opened from the Monday five days\nbefore election day and the ballot papers extracted and placed in a\nsealed ballot box ready for counting after polling day.\n\nTalking points \n\nQuestion: How many postal votes were cast in 2022, how did voters apply for a postal vote and \nhow many postal votes were returned? \n\n•\n\nThe AEC issued 2,731,088 postal votes at the 2022 federal election, an increase from 1.5\nmillion in 2019.\n\n• Over 56% of voters applied for a vote online, an increase from 44% in 2019.\n•\n\n31.5% completed a paper postal vote application. These applications were processed by our\npartner, Computershare in all states and territories.\nThe remaining 12.5% were sent to general postal voters, who automatically receive ballot\npapers in the mail after an election has been announced.\nThe AEC received 2,382,267 completed postal votes before 13 day deadline after polling day.\nThis represents a return rate of 87%, higher than the 2019 return rate of 84.1%.\n\n•\n\n•\n\nQuestion: How did the AEC engage with key stakeholders to successfully deliver postal voting in \n2022? \n\n•\n\n•\n\nThe AEC recognised early in the preparation for the 2022 event that both the COVID-19\npandemic and international experience would likely have a significant effect on postal voting.\nWe expected significantly high volumes of applications, greater scrutiny and challenges with\nproduction and lodgement.\nThe AEC leveraged strong relationships with the AEC’s postal vote provider Computershare\nand with Australia Post to ensure success. These partners provided their expertise to co-\ndesign materials and processes that mitigated risks and improved voter experience.\n\nBranch \nContact \n\nDelivery and Support Branch \nNatasha Scandrett, A/g Assistant Commissioner \n\nUpdated \nPrinted \n\n23/01/2023 \n23/01/2023 8:46 AM \n\nLEX3715 Released DocumentReleased under the Freedom of Information Act 1982\n\n\n--- Page 30 ---\n\nNo: 39 \n\n•  This engagement was conducted at multiple levels of all three organisations and evolved into \n\ngovernance and delivery activities during the event. \n\n•  The AEC knew that a proportion of the expected volume of applications would be attributed to \npolitical party/candidate led PVA distribution. To ensure that the PVAs distributed would be \ncompliant and provided direct to Computershare, the AEC published the PVA Management \nGuide on the Candidate Hub. This guide provided key information as well as QR artwork that \ncould be added to materials as needed. Specific guides were also created for each \nComputershare or TIMG site, with specific opening times and access requirements. \n\n•  The AEC pursued legislative changes to the requirements for a Postal Vote Certificate in order \n\nto be able to produce the higher volumes expected.  \n\n•  The short period between the passing of legislative changes and the announcement of the \n\nelection did not allow for direct voter engagement. To ensure voter needs were met the AEC: \n\no  Sourced an experienced, external form designer to provide specialist advice and \n\nensure voter needs and behaviours were catered for in the design of new materials \nInserted pictorial instructions on the inside of the new PVC \n\no \no  Tested materials with AEC staff and their families \no  Produced and published a video demonstration of how to complete a postal vote \n\nwhich was viewed over 120,000 times \n\no  Updated and added guidance on the AEC website \n\n•  The AEC is currently working on enhancing the postal vote design further to enhance the user \n\nexperience and maximise enfranchisement. \n\nQuestion: What was the effect of legislative changes made in 2021? \n\nModernised design \n\nThe legislative change in 2021 allowed AEC the opportunity to rethink the design and function of \nthe postal voting materials sent to voters. During the redesign process AEC staff considered the \ndifficulties faced and complaints made by voters in previous elections, production efficiencies and \nmaterial durability. \n\nTo mitigate the voter concerns the AEC: \n\n•  Engaged an experienced form designer to provide specialist advice and ensure voter needs \n\nand behaviours were catered for in the design \n\n•  Provided every voter with a return envelope in which both their ballot paper and personal \n\ndetails were secure. \n\n•  Printed completion instructions with supporting images inside the certificate. \n•  Produced and published a video demonstration of how to complete a postal vote.  \n\no  This video was accessed via a QR code within the postal vote certificate (PVC).  \no  Captions for the video were translated and available in 19 different languages \no  The video was viewed over 97,000 times over April and May 2022 and was also \npublished on our AEC TV YouTube channel which has also been viewed over \n31,000 times. \n\nThe AEC worked with our partners, Computershare, to design a PVC that did not have to be glued \ninto an envelope. Whilst a seemingly small feature of the previous design, this change: \n\n•  Eliminated multiple risks including: \n\no  Availability of sub-contracted services: during our preparations only one supplier in \n\nAustralia was able to provide folding and gluing services \n\no  Ballot paper security and voter privacy: the new PVC was produced only by \nComputershare and did not need to be transported to other suppliers. \n\n•  Significantly increased production and ensured that postal materials were dispatched to \n\napplicants in the shortest timeframe possible. \n\nPage 2 of 6 \n\nLEX3715 Released Document No. 37Released under the Freedom of Information Act 1982\n\n\n--- Page 31 ---\n\nNo: 39 \n\n•  Provided greater control and allowed Computershare to organise additional shifts when \n\nnecessary. \n\nTo ensure the new materials, specifically the return envelope, were compliant with Australia Post \nrequirements the AEC also ran lodgement trials. These successful trials provided assurance that \nnot only did the materials meet the addressing requirements to ensure efficient sorting by Australia \nPost, but also that the ballot papers could be securely returned to the AEC without damage.  \n\nBallot paper extraction prior to election day \n\nNew legislation allowing votes from declaration envelopes to be extracted from the Monday prior to \nelection day enabled the AEC to process a large number of postal vote results faster after election \nday. By the Tuesday after election day, results for over 750,000 House of Representatives postal \nvotes were known, in comparison to just over 200,000 at the same time for the 2019 federal \nelection. \n\nQuestion: How were PVAs managed during the 2022 election? \n\nPVA scanning and data capture services were provided by Computershare. The co-designed \nsolution provided the following improvements to PVA management: \n\n•  To increase use of the online option, a QR code was added to the approved PVA artwork. \n•  Where possible Computershare were provided with candidate/party PVA artwork prior to the \nannouncement of the election. This allowed Computershare to pre-program their systems to \nrecognise and capture completed forms without requiring manual input by AEC staff. \n\n•  Paper PVAs were sent directly to Computershare to reduce double handling and ensure data \n\nwas captured from PVAs as soon as possible. \n\n•  PVAs were sent to Computershare via a number of methods: \n\no  Candidates and parties could deliver bulk PVAs to Computershare or TIMG sites in \n\neach state and territory \n\no  Voters could email, fax or post their completed PVA. \n\nQuestion: How many PVAs were received from political parties in the 2022 election? What were \nthe challenges with these PVAs? \n\nOverall the AEC received 893,243 paper PVAs of which 551, 274 (61%) can be directly attributed \nto political parties. The single consequence of direct delivery of PVAs to Computershare was that, \ndue to a lack of information provided on packaging or made available to couriers, Computershare \ncould not accurately record the source of the remaining 39% of paper PVAs.  \n\nIn addition, the following challenges arose: \n\n• \n\nsome political parties chose to make significant changes to the approved PVA artwork, \nincluding removing the QR code. Each significant change needed to be reviewed by the AEC \nto ensure compliance and led to a delay in production. \n\n• \n\n•  The AEC was not provided with all versions of the PVA artwork used by political parties and \ncandidates. This led to PVAs distributed in particular areas with an incorrect return address. \nWhilst the address used was managed by the AEC, it was collected by a different supplier and \nled to double handling and delays in processing. \nLate engagement by both the ALP and Liberal Party with regard to their online applications did \nnot provide adequate time for the AEC to conduct full risk assessments and mitigations. \nIn line with the previous events, many queries and complaints were received from voters that \nhad not received their postal materials despite returning a paper PVA up to 2 weeks prior to \nthe complaint. Upon further enquiry it was found that the PVA in question had been returned to \nthe political party and not yet received by the AEC. \n\n• \n\nPage 3 of 6 \n\nLEX3715 Released Document No. 37Released under the Freedom of Information Act 1982\n\n\n--- Page 32 ---\n\nNo: 39 \n\nQuestion: In light of the negative comments regarding postal ballots at elections overseas, what \ndoes the AEC do to ensure the integrity of postal voting in Federal Elections? \n\n•  Postal voting has been an integral part of Australian elections since before Federation and like \n\nall AEC processes is strictly governed by legislation and AEC policies and procedures. \n\n•  The procedures for postal voting are governed by Part XV of the Commonwealth Electoral Act \n\n1918 (the Electoral Act). \n\n•  Every postal vote returned to the AEC must be matched to an elector before it is included in \n\nthe count. \n\n•  The matching process includes the following preliminary scrutiny: \n\n▪  Name and address match \n▪  Postal vote signed by elector \n▪  Witness requirements \n▪  Check that the elector and witness declarations are dated on or before polling day \n▪  Checks of signatures if deemed necessary \n▪ \n\nIf the elector has already cast a declaration vote that has been counted (whether that be \nby postal, absent or provisional) the vote is not included in the count. \n\n•  To ensure the secrecy of the ballot, there is a specific process whereby postal votes that are to \nbe included into the count have their ballot papers removed with the elector details facing \ndown, and the ballot papers are then placed in a ballot box and counted separately in batches. \nLike all processes regarding the counting of ballot papers, these processes can be observed \nby scrutineers. \n\n• \n\nQuestion: Did the increase in postal votes slow down the count and make it longer for seats to be \ndeclared? \n\nThere are a number of factors that impact the speed of the count and the AECs ability to declare \nthe poll in each division. One of these factors is the requirement to wait until 13 days after election \nday to receive returned postal votes, however the 2022 event saw other factors, including the \nincrease in the number of candidates and voters marking a first preference for candidates other \nthan the two-candidate preferred candidates, also affect the AEC’s ability to declare. \n\nNew legislation that allowed ballots to be extracted from PVCs from the Monday before polling day \ndid assist to increase the speed of the count, as did the changes to allow the unfolding and initial \nsorting of ordinary votes taken at pre-poll voting centres from 4pm on polling day. Further \nlegislative change, such as beginning these processes earlier and streamlining declaration voting \nmay further allow the AEC to provide earlier indicative results in line with public expectations. \n\n•  While the Electoral Act requires electors to cast their postal vote before 6pm on polling day, \nthe AEC is required to wait until 13 days after election day to receive returned postal votes. \n•  A seat cannot be declared until the number of potential votes yet to be counted (which until the \n\n13th day includes all postal votes issued) cannot change the outcome. \n\n•  This can mean that votes that may decide the election may not be received until almost \n2 weeks after polling day. Therefore, if there is a greater percentage of postal votes, the \nlikelihood of these votes delaying declaration is higher (particularly in marginal or close seats). \n\n•  The AEC’s integrity process for the return of postal votes also means that there are more \n\nchecks and balances required than counting ordinary ballot papers cast in a physical polling \nplace. This too can slow down the count and is resource intensive. The AEC applies the same \nintegrity processes to all returned postal votes, regardless of whether the result of a seat or the \nelection is beyond doubt.  \n\nPage 4 of 6 \n\nLEX3715 Released Document No. 37Released under the Freedom of Information Act 1982\n\n\n--- Page 33 ---\n\nNo: 39 \n\nPostal voting talking points \n\n• When electors apply online for a postal vote application the AEC has full digital visibility of\neach individual application and its status. This is the way the majority (56% in 2022) of\napplications are received. When electors apply using a paper postal vote application, they can\nbe received by the AEC through a number of channels including through third parties such as\npolitical parties.\n\n•\n\n•\n\n•\n\n•\n\nPaper forms by their nature require the data to be captured from the form and the information\nrecorded in order for the data to be included in the AEC’s postal voting system and the postal\nvote sent. Previously this was done by manual data entry. However, developments in\ntechnology have allowed for a digital data capture solution. The AEC has used this digital\nsolution to capture data from paper postal vote applications for the last three federal elections.\n\nAt no stage during previous elections has the AEC had any doubt that the data from paper\napplications was being captured and postal votes actioned.\n\nComputershare Communication Services provide both the scanning of paper applications and\nthe printing and mailing of postal voting packs.\n\nComments about postal voting processes for the 2020 US elections may have meant there\nwas more scrutiny of the Australian process. Due to the preparation and engagement activities\nundertaken by AEC, the AEC did not experience a significantly higher level of scrutiny. Whilst\nsome questions and accusations were raised in social media forums, the AEC was able to\nquickly demonstrate the integrity of our processes and resolve problems as required\n\n• While the AEC attempts to match all postal vote applications to an elector on the electoral roll\nbefore dispatching the postal vote, this is not always possible. In 2022, 1.5% of the 2,731,088\npostal votes issued were not matched to an elector.\n\n•\n\n•\n\nThe AEC works very closely with Australia Post and Computershare to ensure postal votes are\ndelivered before the election and to facilitate their return to the AEC.  These relationships were\ncritical to the successful delivery of postal voting services.\n\nThe AEC received some publicity at the 2019 federal election when it was raised in the media\nthat a postal vote for Mr Edward (Ned) Kelly was delivered to the Glenrowan Hotel. As the\nAEC explained at the time, the legislation allows for any person to complete a PVA, however,\nthe processes upon return means the vote will only be counted if that name can be matched to\nthe address on the electoral roll.\n\n2022 federal election postal voting statistics \n\no Number of Postal Votes Issued: 2,731,088\n\no Number of Postal Votes Returned: 2,389,751\n\no Number of Postal Votes Admitted to count: 2,212,301\n\no Number of Postal Votes Partially Admitted*: 1,256\n\no Number of Postal Votes Rejected**: 176,880\n\n▪\n\n▪\n\n* Partially admitted means that only the Senate Ballot Paper was counted\n\n** 140,124 (79.2%) of postal votes rejected were due to no elector or witness signature\n\nPage 5 of 6 \n\nLEX3715 Released Document No. 37Released under the Freedom of Information Act 1982\n\n\n--- Page 34 ---\n\nNo: 39 \n\nRecent legislative changes \n\nElectoral Legislation Amendment (Counting, Scrutiny and Operational Efficiencies) Act 2021 \nRoyal Assent 2 September 2021 \n\nMeasure \n\nDetails \n\nRemove the requirement \nfor paper postal vote \napplications (PVAs) to be \nsent to the home division \nAllow digital process for \noverseas voters who \ncan't find an authorised \nwitness \n\nAdmitting postal vote \nballot papers outside \nPVC envelope but within \nan outer envelope \n\nAllow extraction of ballot \npapers from declaration \nvote envelopes before \npolling day \n\nThis removes the requirement to send paper PVAs in the declaration \nvote exchange. The divisions where the paper PVA is received will \nretain the paper form with other election records, to be destroyed in \naccordance with statutory authorisation.  \nUnder s 194(1A), an overseas voter who can't find a witness can \nattach to their postal vote a signed and dated statement and a \nphotocopy of their passport. This change allows them to submit their \nstatement and an image of their passport electronically. \nIf a postal ballot paper is returned inside an outer envelope but \noutside the postal vote certificate (PVC) it is currently not allowed to \nbe admitted to the count. This measure saves those votes. It enables \nthe AEC to supply a return outer envelope with the postal voting \npack, easing voters’ concerns about privacy. \nThe opening of the envelopes, extracting of ballot papers, unfolding \nand reconciling, is shifted from just before further scrutiny, to just \nafter preliminary scrutiny, if it is up to five days before polling day. \nThe ballot papers will be placed in ballot boxes ready for sorting and \ncounting after the close of the poll.

\n\n• The AEC’s investigation into the discarded ballot papers is ongoing and a report will be written\n\nonce finalised.\n\n• At this stage the finding is that the completed ballot papers are likely to have been discarded\ndeclaration ballot papers (that is, an out-of-area voter should have returned their completed\nballot paper to be placed inside a completed declaration envelope, but in these instances they\nhave likely not been returned as per the instruction).\n\n• Ballot papers in the AEC’s possession (prior to issuing to a voter in-person or via post, or after\n\nreceipt of completed ballots from a voter) are tracked from point to point with a range of\nsecurity measures in place.\n\n• Ballot papers in a voter’s possession (e.g. when voting via post or in-person) are the\n\nresponsibility of the voter themselves to return to the AEC in the required timeframe in order to\nbe counted.\n\nBranch \n\nNew South Wales \n\nContact \n\nRebecca Main, AEO NSW \n\nUpdated \n\nPrinted \n\n31/10/2022 (Remains \ncorrect at 19/01/2023) \n23/01/2023 7:56 AM \n\nLEX3715 Released Document No. 69Released under the Freedom of Information Act 1982\n\n\n--- Page 73 ---\n\nNo: 69\n\nPage 2 of 2 \n\nLEX3715 Released Document No. 6923Released under the Freedom of Information Act 1982\n\n\n--- Page 74 ---\n\nREDACTION CODES \n\nPersonal Information (name) redacted. \n\nPersonal Information (date of birth) redacted. \n\nPersonal Information (photograph) redacted \n\nPersonal Information (facsimile of signature) redacted. \n\nPersonal Information (facsimile of manuscript initialling) redacted. \n\nPersonal Information (Individual’s address) redacted. \n\nPersonal Information (individual’s telephone number) redacted. \n\nPersonal Information (individual’s opinion) redacted. \n\nPersonal Information (opinion about individual) redacted. \n\nPersonal Information (employment history) redacted. \n\nPersonal Information (qualifications) redacted. \n\nPersonal Information (health) redacted. \n\nPersonal Information (identifying individual) redacted. \n\nBusiness information (Bank Account details) redacted. \n\nBusiness information (Billing Account details) redacted. \n\nBusiness information (internal operations) redacted. \n\nLegal Professional Communication redacted. \n\nDeliberative material redacted. \n\nIrrelevant material redacted. \n\nElectoral Roll material redacted. \n\nTests, examinations or audits material redacted. \n\nManagement or assessment of personnel material redacted. \n\nProper and efficient conduct of the operations of AEC material redacted. \n\nLawful methods or procedures for preventing, detecting, investigating, or \ndealing with matters arising out of, breaches or evasions of the law. \n\nTrade Secrets. \n\nCommercial valuable information. \n\nFinancial interests of the Commonwealth. \n\nProperty interests of the Commonwealth. \n\n1 \n\n2 \n\n3 \n\n4 \n\n5 \n\n6 \n\n7 \n\n8 \n\n9 \n\n10 \n\n11 \n\n12 \n\n13 \n\n14 \n\n15 \n\n16 \n\n17 \n\n18 \n\n19 \n\n20 \n\n21 \n\n22 \n\n23 \n\n24 \n\n25 \n\n26 \n\n27 \n\n28\n\nProvide only the markdown formatted summary text.
