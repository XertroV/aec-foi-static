            "text": "The documents detail the operations of the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) concerning political party registration, a process that stands as a stark example of government overreach and bureaucratic interference, directly assaulting the principles of individual liberty, rational self-interest, and laissez-faire capitalism.\n\nFrom an Objectivist perspective, the primary function of government is the protection of individual rights, which includes the right to free association, free speech, and the pursuit of one's rational self-interest. A truly free society operates under laissez-faire capitalism, where individuals are left free to produce, trade, and associate voluntarily, without coercive state intervention. The AEC's activities, as revealed in these minutes, fundamentally violate these principles:\n\n**1. Suppression of Individual Initiative and Free Association:**\nThe AEC mandates arbitrary membership thresholds (initially 500, then increased to 1,500) for non-parliamentary parties to register. This is a direct assault on the right to free association. Individuals should be free to form political groups of any size, without state permission or numerical quotas.\n*   **Meeting 272 (Stop Selling Australia Party):** The refusal to register a party due to a statistical sampling methodology, where a single denial among a small sample leads to failure, epitomizes bureaucratic rigidity suppressing political initiative. The \"virtue of productive achievement\" (in this case, forming a political organization) is undermined by arbitrary metrics.\n*   **Meeting 273 & 274 (Increased Membership Thresholds):** The amendment increasing the minimum membership to 1,500 is a severe intensification of government overreach. This acts as an artificial barrier to entry, stifling nascent political movements and limiting the choices available to individuals. It represents a collective standard imposed by the state, rather than allowing individuals to voluntarily support and join parties that reflect their values.\n*   **Meeting 278 (Australian People's Party) & 279 (VOTEFLUX.ORG):** The deregistration of parties for failing to meet these state-imposed membership quotas demonstrates the bureaucratic guillotine at work. These are not actions taken to protect individual rights, but to enforce compliance with arbitrary state mandates, effectively suppressing the political expression of groups of individuals.\n\n**2. Bureaucratic Interference and Overreach:**\nThe AEC's elaborate \"membership testing methodology\" (statistical sampling, contacting members, engaging with the Australian Bureau of Statistics) is a quintessential example of bureaucratic busywork. This is not the protection of rights; it is the creation of a costly, complex, and invasive system to \"validate\" private associations.\n*   **Meetings 272, 273, 274 (Membership Testing):** The continuous refinement and re-endorsement of statistical methodologies by the AEC, including discussions of \"resourcing limitations,\" highlight the inherent inefficiency and cost of government intervention. The state is expending resources to micromanage the internal affairs of private organizations, a role entirely outside the scope of a rights-protecting government.\n*   **Meeting 279 (Logo Change):** The AEC's review and decision on a party's *logo* (Australian Federation Party) is an egregious example of bureaucratic intrusion into the private, aesthetic, and branding choices of a voluntary association. This represents an expansion of the state's impulse to control even the superficial aspects of private initiative.\n\n**3. Violation of Liberty and Property Rights (Intellectual):**\nThe AEC's power to rule on party names based on \"similarity\" is a direct assault on freedom of speech and intellectual property rights, albeit concerning organizational names.\n*   **Meetings 273, 276, 277 (Name Similarity Rulings):** The decisions to deregister \"The New Liberals\" for being too similar to \"Liberal Party of Australia,\" and upholding objections against \"Liberal Democratic Party\" and \"Democratic Labour Party,\" are acts of blatant censorship. The state is dictating how private organizations may name themselves, serving to protect established parties rather than individual expression. This is an anti-competitive measure, stifling the free market of ideas by granting a de facto monopoly on certain terms or branding. Such subjective rulings invite arbitrary and potentially politically motivated enforcement.\n\n**4. Anti-Laissez-Faire and Anti-Competition:**\nThe cumulative effect of the AEC's regulatory framework is to create high barriers to entry for new political parties and to protect the established political order from competition. This is antithetical to the principles of a free market, where individuals should be free to offer their political \"products\" (ideas, candidates) and let the public decide their value. Instead, the state acts as a gatekeeper, determining which \"products\" are even allowed onto the \"market.\"\n\n**5. Forced Conformity:**\nPolitical parties, as voluntary associations, are forced to conform to bureaucratic standards of size, naming conventions, and internal processes. This is a form of forced altruism, not in the sense of monetary redistribution, but in forcing private entities to sacrifice their autonomy and initiative to serve the collective, statist notion of \"electoral integrity\" as defined by the bureaucracy.\n\nIn conclusion, the AEC's functions, as demonstrated in these documents, epitomize the dangers of collectivism and government overreach. They represent a coercive apparatus that micromanages political participation, suppresses individual initiative, and stifles the free expression and association of individuals. A government truly committed to individual rights and laissez-faire principles would limit its role to protecting citizens from force and fraud, not regulating the voluntary formation and naming of political organizations or dictating the internal criteria for their existence. The documents reveal a bureaucracy that consistently prioritizes its own standards and \"scrutiny\" over the fundamental rights of its citizens."

Closing \n\nAgenda item 1: Welcome and Commissioner’s introduction \n\nThe Chair opened the meeting at 11:40am. Mr Tom Rogers acknowledged the traditional owners of \nthe land and welcomed the Commission members; the Hon. Justice Susan Kenny, and \nDr David Gruen. The Commission members welcomed this meeting as the first opportunity for a face-\nto-face meeting since all three members were appointed to the Commission. \n\nsection 47F\n\n\n--- Page 2 ---\n\nAgenda item 2: For information: Party membership process \n\nMs Jo Reid provided background on party registration for federal elections. \n\n•  The role of the AEC is to ensure that parties who apply for registration are compliant under \n\nthe Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 (the Electoral Act). \n\n•  Part of Ms Reid’s role as the Assistant Commissioner of Disclosure, Assurance, and \nEngagement Branch, is to act as the delegate of the Electoral Commission for party \nregistration matters under s126(3) of the Electoral Act.  \n\n•  Parties can either be parliamentary or non-parliamentary. Parliamentary parties must have \n\none Member of Parliament to register. Non-parliamentary parties must provide evidence that \nthey have at least 500 active members.  \n\n•  The AEC currently has 74 parties and state branches registered. Registered parties can have \n\ntheir party name on the ballot paper next to the name of the candidate. \n\n•  Parties are not incorporated entities and are only accountable under the Electoral Act. \nRegardless of registration, all candidates for an election must lodge a financial return. \n•  Ms Reid noted that decisions made by the delegate can be subject to further review by the \n\nCommission under s141 of the Electoral Act. \n\nMembers discussed s129 of the Electoral Act and restrictions of party names, noting the previous \ndecisions made by the AEC and the Commission. \n\nMs Reid provided Commission Members an overview of the Australian Electoral Commission’s \nmembership testing process. \n\n•  The AEC uses statistical sampling to attain confidence that a party has at least 500 members. \nThe methodology for this process was developed in March 2010, and reviewed and updated \nin 2011 and 2017.  \n\n•  To determine whether a political party meets the requirements of the Electoral Act relating to \nthe number of members, the AEC will contact a random sample of 18 to 50 members where \nthe sample size corresponds with the size of the list provided. A certain percentage of \nmembers must confirm their membership when contacted by the AEC. \n\n•  Mr Rogers noted that the review of the methodology in 2017 pertained to whether non-\n\nresponses are able to be considered as neither confirming nor denying membership. The \nadvice received from the previous Australian Statistician, Mr David Kalisch, indicated that the \noriginal membership testing considered a non-response a denial. The approach taken by the \nAEC would not disadvantage the party, in fact considering non-responses as neither \nconfirmations nor denials would be potentially advantageous for the party. \n\n•  Based on the advice of the then Australian Statistician, Mr David Kalisch, the current \n\nmethodology provides no less than a 90% confidence rate that a party has 500 members.  \n\n•  Ms Reid noted that the process has never been tested in a court. Commission members \nnoted that the process could be tested by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT). \n\nMembers discussed the process, noting the risk that the AAT would consider resourcing limitations a \nweak argument for the random sample approach. Members noted that a stronger argument would \ninvolve a high statistical confidence in the methodology, demonstrated attempts to avoid penalising \napplicants, and evidence that alternative methodologies have been investigated. \n\nMembers agreed that further investigation of the membership testing methodology should be \nundertaken. \n\nMinutes: Australian Electoral Commission Meeting No. 272 \n\nPage 2\n\n\n--- Page 3 ---\n\nAction \n\nOfficer \n\n272.1  The Australian Electoral Commission will engage with the Australian \n\nTom Rogers \n\nBureau of Statistics, regarding the membership testing methodology, to: \n\n1.  Obtain updated advice on the current methodology  \n2.  Explore whether there is an alternative methodology that \n\nincreases the statistical confidence without unduly affecting the \nresourcing of the Australian Electoral Commission \n\nMs Jo Reid excused herself from the meeting. \n\nAgenda item 3: For Decision: Application for review under s141 – Stop Selling Australia Party \n\nMembers discussed the application for review under s141 of the Electoral Act concerning the \nregistration of the Stop Selling Australia Party, as outlined by the commission paper. \n\nMembers noted the recommendation that the Commission affirms the delegate’s decision of 18 \nSeptember 2020 to refuse the application to register the Party. \n\nMembers noted that, as the membership list contains exactly eligible 500 members, a single denial \nfrom the testing of 18 members of the list results in a failure to meet the minimum required number of \neligible members. . Members reflected the discussion and resultant action item 272.1 that had \noccurred under agenda item 2. \n\nThe Commission reflected that the AEC made demonstrated and numerous attempts to remain in \ncontact with the Party.  \n\nOn this basis, the Members agreed to affirm the delegate’s decision of 18 September 2020 to refuse \nthe application to register the Party, and the additional information provided by the affected party \nunder review pursuant to section 141(4) of the Electoral Act.  \n\nAgenda item 4: Closing \n\nThe Chair closed the meeting at 12:30pm. \n\nMinutes: Australian Electoral Commission Meeting No. 272 \n\nPage 3\n\n\n\n--- Page 1 ---\n\nMinutes \n\nAustralian Electoral Commission \nMeeting No. 273 \n\nDate: Friday 3 September 2021  Time: 10:00am  Location: Microsoft Teams \n\nAttendees:  \nThe Hon. Justice Susan Kenny AM (Chair);  \nMr Tom Rogers (Electoral Commissioner);  \nDr David Gruen (Australian Statistician)   \n\nAction Officer: \n\n (Commission Secretariat) \n\nAgenda  \n\nItem \n\n1.  Welcome \n\n2.  Party Registration – overview of process \n\n3.  Commission paper –  \n\n4.  Closing \n\nAgenda item 1: Welcome and Commissioner’s introduction \n\nThe Chair opened the meeting at 10:00am. Mr Tom Rogers acknowledged the traditional \nowners of the land and welcomed the three-person Australian Electoral Commission (the \nCommission) members; the Hon. Justice Susan Kenny, and Dr David Gruen. \n\nsection 47F\n\n\n--- Page 2 ---\n\nAgenda item 2: For discussion: Membership testing process and approach \n\nMr Rogers provided an update on amendments to the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 \n(the Electoral Act). The amendments require a change to the membership testing \nmethodology used by the AEC. This change to the methodology due to an increase of the \nminimum number of members for a party to register as a non-parliamentary party.  \n\nMr Rogers noted that any changes will require consideration and a decision from the \nCommission. The current membership testing process was endorsed by the Commission on \n20 March 2017, and was most recently discussed by the Commission following the briefing \nby Dr David Gruen and staff from the ABS on 11 June 2021.  \n\nMr Rogers noted that it was likely that there will be 35 federally registered non-Parliamentary \nparties that will require a review, along with any further parties that may apply for \nregistration. \n\nMr Rogers referred to meeting paper 2. Commission agenda item - party registration \nmembership testing and summarised the five approaches for the consideration of the \nCommission.  \n\nThe Chair noted the significant administrative burden that Option Three may have if the AEC \nwas to email more than 1,500 people in each party. \n\nThe Chair also noted that the introduction of the Bill would indicate that there is a desire to \nmaintain a high level of scrutiny. Options Four and Five would reduce that level of scrutiny, \nand thus, would not align with the intent of the legislation. \n\nDr Gruen noted a point raised in an application for review; non-responses could theoretically \nbring the number of members relied upon for a membership list under the minimum required \nnumber to be registered as a non-parliamentary political party.  \n\nDr Gruen raised that if an external provider has the resources at hand there may not be a \ncontinued need for a sampling methodology. The Chair agreed. \n\nMr Rogers noted that there is a need to continue to uphold the security and integrity of the \nelectoral roll. Mr Rogers noted the intermediate option to investigate the possibility of utilising \nanother government department to conduct the membership testing.  \n\nMr Rogers noted that two elements to address would be cost and the capacity of the other \norganisation to undertake the testing. \n\nCommission decision:  \n\nInvestigate Option 2 from the meeting paper 2. Commission agenda item - party \nregistration membership testing before a further decision is made. \n\nMinutes: Australian Electoral Commission Meeting No. 273 \n\nPage 2\n\n\n--- Page 3 ---\n\nAgenda item 3: For information: Update on current matters before the Commission \n\nMr Rogers provided an update on current matters that are not yet ready for decision by the \nCommission. Mr Rogers noted that at this point there are three live applications for review \nunderway. All three applications are party registration decisions that have been submitted \nunder s141 of the Electoral Act. \n\nSmall Business Party \n\nThe Small Business Party (SBP) was deregistered by the delegate on 23 August 2021. The \noriginal decision was based on a failure to meet the required number of members. \n\nAn application for review was made by the Registered Officer of the party, \n\n, on 27 August 2021. \n\nNo membership list has been provided yet; the deadline for further information is 30 \nSeptember. \n\nThe Seniors United Party of Australia \n\nThe Seniors United Party of Australia (SUPA) was deregistered by the delegate on \n9 March 2021. The original decision was based on a failure to meet the required number of \nmembers. \n\nAn application for review was submitted by a member of SUPA, \nMarch 2021. \nmembership list. \n\n has provided information appealing the decision, but not a \n\n on 21 \n\nA request for an updated membership list was sent to SUPA on 7 July 2021. The Party have \nmade several requests for extra time. The current deadline for the provision of any additional \ninformation is 25 September 2021. \n\nThe party has indicated that the continued lockdown in NSW may result in further requests \nfor an extension of time.  \n\nThe party has been made aware that, as the party is currently not registered, there is a risk \nthat SUPA will not be registered when an election is called. \n\nCommission members discussed the two applications for review and decided that \ncorrespondence should be provided to SBP and SUPA, regarding the impact of the \namendments to the Electoral Act. \n\nDecision: Provide the Small Business Party and the Seniors Uniter Party of Australia \nwith awareness that the legislation will change the minimum number of members \nrequired to form a parliamentary party. \n\nMinutes: Australian Electoral Commission Meeting No. 273 \n\nPage 3 \n\nsection 47Fsection 47Fsection 47Fsection 42section 42\n\n\n--- Page 4 ---\n\nThe New Liberals \n\nMr Rogers raised that as part of the application for review, the leader of The New Liberals, \nMr Victor Kline, has requested that the Electoral Commissioner recuse themselves from the \nreview. Mr Rogers indicated that he sees no basis to recuse himself from the review, with the \nChair and Dr Gruen agreed. \n\nThe New Liberals were registered as a non-parliamentary party on 3 June 2021. Mr Andrew \nHirst of the Liberal Party of Australia lodged an application for review under s141 in regards \nto this decision. The issues raised by the application of : \n\n•  The name ‘The New Liberals’ is too similar to the name ‘Liberal Party of Australia’ \n\n(s129 (1)(d) and (da) of the Electoral Act) \n\n•  The New Liberals are not able to meet the membership requirements due to non-\n\ncontacts. (s126 (2)(ca) of the Electoral Act) \n\nThe New Liberals were advised of an application for review and provided a redacted version \nof the objection. Mr Kline submitted further material for the consideration of the commission  \n\nMr Kline has indicated publically that the party will lodge an application to change their \nname. The name change is not yet publically available on the Australian Electoral \nCommission website0 \n\nThe Commission agreed that further action should be undertaken when the name change is \npublished on the Australian Electoral Commission website. \n\nThe Commission further agreed to review the legal advice received on this issue and discuss \nat a future meeting, noting that the Commission undertake a de novo review of this matter \nunder s141 of the Electoral Act.  \n\nAgenda item 4: Closing \n\nThe Chair thanked members for attending and closed the meeting at 11:30am. \n\nMinutes: Australian Electoral Commission Meeting No. 273 \n\nPage 4\n\n\n\n--- Page 1 ---\n\nMinutes \n\nAustralian Electoral Commission \nMeeting No. 274 \n\nDate: Wednesday 6 October 2021  Time: 4:00pm  Location: Microsoft Teams \n\nAttendees:  \nThe Hon.

Closing \n\nAgenda item 1: Welcome and Commissioner’s introduction \n\nThe Chair opened the meeting at 4:00pm. The meeting commenced with the three-person \nAustralian Electoral Commission (the Commission) members; the Hon. Justice Susan \nKenny, Mr Tom Rogers, and Dr David Gruen, and Mr Anders Homberg, Chief Methodologist \nof the Australian Bureau Statistics (ABS), as a guest for Item 2. \n\nMr Rogers provided an update to the Commission on administrative matters concerning the \nAustralian Electoral Commission (AEC). \n\nsection 47F\n\n\n--- Page 2 ---\n\nAgenda item 2: For decision: Membership testing process and approach \n\nIn response to recent amendments to the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 (the Electoral \nAct) by the Electoral Legislation Amendment (Party Registration Integrity) Act 2021 (the \nParty Registration Act), the Commission discussed proposed sample sizes for registered \nnon-Parliamentary political party membership list testing as outlined in the paper entitled \n‘Party registration – ABS advice for membership testing lists for 'at least 1,500 members'.    \n\nThe proposed methodology, which examined sample sizes derived from data provided by \nthe ABS, is based on the current method with updated sample sizes. \n\nThe Commission endorsed the methodology of the proposed approach but requested \nadditional statistical advice from the ABS regarding the percentage chances of incorrectly \nrejecting or accepting membership lists. \n\nCommission decision:  \n\n•  Agree that ABS staff will recalibrate the parameters in the data provided to the \nCommission to ensure a reasonable (low) probability of rejecting a valid list or \naccepting an invalid list. The Commission will examine the re-worked parameters out-\nof-session. \n\n•  Agree that the Commission endorses the current general approach, noting that the \n\nmethodology is an extension of the existing methodology. \n\nAgenda item 3: For decision: Manner and timing of non-parliamentary political party \nregister review \n\nIn response to the recent amendments to the Electoral Act by the Party Registration Act, the \nCommission examined administrative processes for the AEC to ensure registered non-\nParliamentary parties meet new membership eligibility requirements within the three-month \nperiod provided by the Party Registration Act.  The Commission endorsed a review of the \nregistered non-Parliamentary parties under section 138A of the Electoral Act, with \nsubsequent action to be taken under section s137 of the Electoral Act if appropriate. \n\nDecision: \n\n•  Agree that the Commission will, for the purpose of reviewing the Register, provide a \n\nnotice under s 138A of the Electoral Act to each registered non-Parliamentary party to \nrequest specified information to establish that the party meets the 1,500 membership \neligibility requirement as at 2 December 2021. \n\nAgenda item 4: Closing \n\nThe Chair thanked members for attending and closed the meeting at 5:10pm. \n\nMinutes: Australian Electoral Commission Meeting No. 274 \n\nPage 2\n\n\n\n--- Page 1 ---\n\nMinutes \n\nAustralian Electoral Commission \nMeeting No. 276 \n\nDate: Wednesday 17 November 2021  Time: 4:00pm  Location: Microsoft Teams \n\nAttendees:  \nThe Hon.

Welcome \n\n2.  For decision: Seniors United Party of Australia \n\n3.  For decision: The New Liberals \n\n4.  Closing \n\nAgenda item 1: Welcome and Commissioner’s introduction \n\nThe meeting opened at 4:00pm with the three-person Australian Electoral Commission (the \nCommission) in attendance; the Hon. Justice Susan Kenny, Mr Tom Rogers, and \nDr David Gruen. \n\nsection 47F\n\n\n--- Page 2 ---\n\nAgenda item 2: For decision: Seniors United Party of Australia \n\nIn relation to the application for review regarding the deregistration of the Seniors United \nParty of Australia, the Commission examined and discussed the material before it, including \nthe results of the assessment of the revised membership list submitted by the Party on 23 \nSeptember 2021. \n\nThe Commission decided:  \n\n•  To set aside the decision of the delegate made under s 137(6) of the Commonwealth \nElectoral Act 1918 (Cth) on 9 March 2021 to deregister the Seniors United Party of \nAustralia; and \n\n•  To substitute a decision to take all such steps as are necessary to give effect to its \n\ndecision, including to maintain the registration of the Seniors United Party of Australia \nby re-registering that Party. \n\nAgenda item 3: For decision: The New Liberals \n\nThe Electoral Commissioner noted that The New Liberals sought his recusal from the review \nof the delegate’s decision to register The New Liberals “on the basis of reasonable \napprehension of bias”, for the reasons stated in a document dated 5 July 2021.  The \nElectoral Commissioner advised that he had no “material personal interest” within s 29 of the \nPublic Governance, Performance and Accountability Act 2013; no “direct or indirect \npecuniary interest” within s 11 of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918; and that there was \nno basis for a reasonable apprehension of bias on his part.  Having considered the matters \nraised by The New Liberals, the other members of the Commission agreed that there was no \nbasis shown for the Electoral Commissioner to withdraw from the review.   \n\nIn relation to the applications for review, the Commission examined and discussed the \nmaterial before it, including the material provided by the Liberal Party of Australia, the \nNational Party of Australia and The New Liberals, and the material before the delegate in \nmaking the decision under review.  The Commission was satisfied that an assessment of the \nmembership list submitted by The New Liberals showed that The New Liberals has at least \n500 members, and that the assessment was made in conformity with the sampling \nmethodology endorsed by the Commission.  The Commission concluded, however, that the \nname “The New Liberals” so nearly resembles the name, “Liberal Party of Australia” and/or \nthe abbreviation “Liberal” that it is likely to be confused with or mistaken for that name or that \nabbreviation, as the case may be.  Accordingly, the application for registration by The New \nLiberals must be refused pursuant to s 129(1)(d) of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918.  \n\nThe Commission decided: \n\n•  To set aside the decision of the delegate made on 3 June 2021 to register The New \nLiberals (the Party) under Part XI of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 (the Act); \nand  \n\n•  To substitute a decision to refuse the application to register the Party as a political \n\nparty under Part XI of the Act; \n\n•  To take all such steps as are necessary to give effect to the Commission’s decision, \nincluding to remove the Party from the Register of Political Parties maintained under \ns 125 of the Act.  \n\nMinutes: Australian Electoral Commission Meeting No. 276 \n\nPage 2\n\n\n--- Page 3 ---\n\nAgenda item 4: Closing \n\nThe Chairperson thanked members for attending and closed the meeting at 5:00pm. \n\nMinutes: Australian Electoral Commission Meeting No. 276 \n\nPage 3\n\n\n\n--- Page 1 ---\n\nMinutes \n\nAustralian Electoral Commission \nMeeting No. 277 \n\nDate: Friday 4 February 2022  Time: 2:00pm  Location: Microsoft Teams \n\nAttendees:  \nThe Hon.
