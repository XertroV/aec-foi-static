  "prompt": "Create a concise, single-paragraph summary in markdown format of the following FOI request summary:\n\nSummary:\n\n### Summary of FOI Request Documents\n\n#### Main Purpose of the FOI Request\nThe primary purpose of the FOI request appears to be to obtain internal documents of the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) related to its procurement and contract management procedures, policies, and associated templates. The documents provided shed light on how the AEC manages its acquisition of goods and services, including detailed guidelines for staff and financial delegates.\n\n#### Documents from the FOI Request\nThe released documents include a schedule of documents indicating the release of:\n*   AEC Intranet content related to Procurement and Contract Management.\n*   AEC Procurement and Contract Management Procedures (October 2020).\n*   Specific forms and templates:\n    *   Procurement and Contract Risk Assessment\n    *   Contract Management Checklist\n    *   Contract Management Plan\n    *   End of Contract Evaluation\n    *   Procurement Variation Request Form\n    *   Financial Delegate Checklist Variations\n    *   Template – Work Order (specifically for DTA Digital Marketplace Specialist - Labour Hire)\n*   Internal policies and guidelines:\n    *   Working Additional Hours Policy\n    *   ETG Travel Guidelines\n\nMany documents, particularly policy details and forms, contain redactions citing exemptions (e.g., Exemption 22, Exemption 47F).\n\n#### Main Content from the FOI Request Documents\nThe released documents provide comprehensive insight into the AEC's internal governance regarding procurement and contracts:\n\n**1. AEC Procurement and Contract Management Procedures (October 2020)**\n*   **Purpose & Framework:** Intends to guide AEC personnel on understanding and abiding by the Commonwealth’s procurement policy and framework, including the Public Governance, Performance and Accountability (PGPA) Act, Commonwealth Procurement Rules (CPRs), and specific AEC policies. Emphasizes achieving \"Value for Money\" (VFM) through efficient, effective, economical, and ethical use of public resources.\n*   **Key Principles:** Highlights accountability, transparency, competition, and non-discrimination as core principles.\n*   **Procurement Process:** Details a workflow from establishing business requirements, planning, market approach (open, limited, existing arrangements), evaluation, negotiation, to contract execution.\n*   **Value Thresholds:** Different rules and documentation requirements apply based on procurement value (e.g., over $80,000 for a business case, specific Quick Reference Guides for $80,000-$200,000 and over $200,000).\n*   **Risk Management:** Mandates identification, analysis, allocation, and treatment of risk throughout the procurement and contract lifecycle. Financial advice from the Financial Management Section is recommended for procurements valued at $200,000 and above.\n*   **Indigenous Procurement Policy (IPP):** Requires consideration of Indigenous Enterprises for services valued between $80,000 and $200,000, for Remote Procurements, and for high-value contracts in specific industries. AEC personnel must search Supply Nation.\n*   **Existing Arrangements:** Encourages leveraging existing Commonwealth or AEC panel arrangements (\"piggybacking\") to save time and expense, requiring a business case for justification if not using an open tender.\n*   **Commonwealth Contracting Suite (CCS):** Mandatory for procurements under $200,000 (with exemptions), aiming for consistency and streamlining.\n*   **Record Keeping & Reporting:** Mandates recording all procurement activities in My Procurement (AEC's system) and updating My Contracts throughout the agreement's life. Emphasizes transparency through AusTender reporting (e.g., contracts over $10,000, amendments, consultancies, high-value contracts twice yearly, Indigenous procurement details).\n*   **Financial Delegates:** Outlines responsibilities for delegates regarding committing public money (PGPA s23(3)), entering/varying arrangements (PGPA s23(1)), and granting indemnities/guarantees/warranties (PGPA s60), often requiring legal advice from Commercial Law and Procurement (CLP).\n*   **Confidentiality & Unfair Contract Terms:** Details protection of confidential information (applying a 'Confidentiality Test') and adherence to regulations against unfair contract terms, especially with small businesses.\n*   **Ethics & Probity:** Emphasizes ethical conduct, fairness, impartiality, conflict of interest management, and non-acceptance of gifts. Requires Probity Advisors for certain high-value or complex procurements.\n*   **Political Neutrality:** Requires suppliers to complete political neutrality declarations, with Financial Delegates considering potential risks to AEC's impartiality. Funding disclosure checks are conducted for suppliers.\n*   **Consultancies:** Provides criteria for identifying and reporting consultancy services in line with government requirements.\n*   **Contingent Liabilities:** Addresses obligations like indemnities, guarantees, or warranties, which require specific delegate approval and legal advice due to inherent risks.\n*   **Black Economy Procurement Connected Policy (PCP):** For contracts over $4 million, requires suppliers to provide a Statement of Tax Record (STR) from the Australian Taxation Office (ATO).\n\n**2. Forms and Templates (e.g., Contract Management Plan, Risk Assessment, Evaluation, Checklists, Work Order, Variation Request)**\n*   These documents outline the structured approach the AEC takes at different stages of procurement and contract management. They serve as internal guides and accountability mechanisms.\n*   **Contract Management Plan (CMP):** Mandatory for significant election-related, high-value (>$80,000), or complex/high-risk contracts, focusing on performance monitoring, relationship management, and risk mitigation.\n*   **Procurement and Contract Risk Assessment:** Templates guide the systematic identification, analysis, and management of risks.\n*   **End of Contract Evaluation:** A template for assessing contract and supplier performance at completion, contributing to lessons learned.\n*   **Financial Delegate Checklist Variations:** Provides a detailed checklist for delegates to review proposed contract variations, ensuring compliance with VFM, policy, and legal considerations (e.g., IPP, Black Economy Policy, Political Neutrality).\n*   **Template – Work Order:** For labour hire, it specifies requirements such as police checks, security clearances, mandatory training, limitation of liability, WGE compliance, and Indigenous procurement. It also details terms for personnel replacement, termination conditions (including gross misconduct like unauthorized release of confidential material or fraud), and clauses for variations and work location. An attached Deed Poll covers confidentiality, privacy, and conflict of interest for individuals engaged.\n\n**3. ETG Travel Guidelines (6 December 2023)**\n*   **Purpose:** Governs official travel for the Enterprise Transformation Group (ETG) staff.\n*   **Core Principle:** Adherence to \"Lowest Practical Fare,\" prioritizing value for money over personal preference, loyalty points, or specific airlines/aircraft.\n*   **Fare Class:** Economy class is standard unless a specific business case or entitlement for business class is approved and documented.\n*   **Booking Process:**\n    *   **APS Staff:** Book via Expense8, with prior APS Director (EL2+) approval. Reimbursement for eligible expenses (including personal card use for taxis/ride-shares) via Expense8.\n    *   **Labour-hire Staff:** Travel booked by Program Support Team, requiring prior written approval from an APS Director (EL2+). Private vehicle use is a final contingency, requires higher-level approval, and is not covered by AEC insurance.\n*   **Expense Claims (Labour-hire):** Claims for taxis/ride-shares, travel time (1 hour pre-flight + flight duration), and itemized meal/incidental costs (up to specified daily rates: e.g., Breakfast $32.10, Lunch $36.10, Dinner $61.50, Incidentals $23.00, total $152.70/full day) are processed via their recruitment vendor against AEC Travel Policy. Alcoholic beverages are not reimbursed.\n*   **Service Standards:** Requests generally require 10 business days notice; urgent requests require additional approvals.\n\nProvide only the markdown formatted summary text. Do not include any conversational filler or preamble."
