These documents, as listed in the schedule, include detailed methodology advice from the ABS to the AEC, correspondence between the two agencies, and an internal AEC minute approving a \"methodology policy.\" This schedule therefore directly confirms and evidences the consultative process and the ABS's significant advisory role in the AEC's development of its approach to verifying political party membership, exactly as described in the FOI request overview."
