            "text": "This document, \"Analysis of Indigenous Enrolment,\" details the Australian Electoral Commission's (AEC) methodology for estimating Indigenous enrolment rates, specifically the transition from less reliable regression models to a more direct approach.\n\n### Summary of Document\n\nThe document outlines the challenges in estimating Indigenous enrolment rates due to the absence of an Indigenous identifier on the electoral roll. It explains that the AEC previously used indirect estimation via regression models (since 2014) but found these models to be poorly fitting and yield \"alarmingly low\" results.\n\nThe **\"Current method,\"** implemented since 2017, involves directly matching electoral roll data with the Centrelink client file, which includes an Indigenous indicator. This person-level matching, part of the Annual Roll Integrity Review (ARIR), provides the AEC with an explicit Indigenous status for over 6 million enrolled persons, significantly improving the robustness of enrolment rate estimations, although results are still considered indicative.\n\nKey figures presented for 30 June 2018 include:\n*   An estimated Indigenous voting age population of 501,659.\n*   An estimated 383,078 enrolled Indigenous individuals.\n*   An **estimated national Indigenous enrolment rate of 76.4%**.\n*   The identification of 118,581 estimated not enrolled Indigenous individuals.\n\nUtilizing the Centrelink data, the AEC specifically identified **72,451 potentially unenrolled Indigenous Australians** (representing about 61% of the estimated unenrolled). A subsequent enrolment stimulation event in February/March 2019, based on this data, resulted in **2,646 new enrolments** of self-identified Indigenous people, reducing the identified unenrolled cohort from this dataset to 69,143. The document includes tables breaking down enrolled and potentially unenrolled Indigenous Australians by state and electoral division. It also notes issues with data quality for Indigenous Australians aged 65 and over in the Centrelink matching process, requiring further work.\n\n### Relevance to FOI Request LS7888\n\nThis document is highly relevant to FOI request LS7888 as it directly addresses several core components of the inquiry:\n\n*   **New Methodology (Design, Testing, Implementation):** It explicitly describes the \"new methodology\" as the Centrelink data matching approach, detailing its shift from prior regression models, its implementation within the ARIR, and the assumptions and limitations inherent in its design. This directly responds to the request for information on the methodology's design and testing.\n*   **Catalysts:** The document implicitly identifies the inadequacy of previous regression models and the annual availability of Centrelink data as catalysts for adopting the new methodology.\n*   **Tracking and Outcomes:** It provides crucial quantitative outcomes, including the **76.4% estimated national Indigenous enrolment rate for June 2018**, the identification of **72,451 potentially unenrolled Indigenous individuals** through the new method, and the success of the **2,646 new enrolments** facilitated by this data. These figures directly align with and provide detail for the outcomes mentioned in the FOI request overview.\n*   **Indigenous Involvement:** Consistent with the FOI overview, this document provides **limited information** regarding direct Indigenous involvement in the design process of this new methodology.\n*   **Cost/Staff:** The document provides **no information** regarding the final cost or exact staffing for the project, also aligning with the FOI overview's noted limitations."

  "prompt": "Considering this document as part of an FOI request, summarize the document and its relevance to the FOI request in markdown format. FYI the overview of the FOI request is: FOI request LS7888 sought documents (2018-2019) on the Australian Electoral Commission's (AEC) new methodology for its Indigenous Electoral Participation Program (IEPP), specifically its design, testing, and implementation, including catalysts, tracking, outcomes, Indigenous involvement, and cost/staff. The released documents, primarily emails and internal papers, reveal that the core of the new methodology is the direct matching of electoral roll data with Centrelink Indigeneity data, a more robust approach initiated internally to improve accuracy, replacing less reliable prior regression models. This method helped identify over 107,000 unenrolled Indigenous individuals, contributing to enrolment stimulation events (e.g., 2,646 new enrolments). The documents confirm estimated national Indigenous enrolment rates of 76.4% (June 2018) and 76.6% (June 2019), demonstrating a significant upward trend from previous estimates, though they provide limited information on Indigenous involvement in the design process or the final cost and exact staffing for the project.\n\nDocument Text:\n\nAnalysis of Indigenous Enrolment \n\nPopulation estimates \n\nTable 1 represents the ABS estimated resident Indigenous population 18 years and over by state \nas at 2016 and projected to 30 June 2019. \n\nThe projected population for Indigenous Australians has been recently updated and adjusted by \nthe ABS.

No. 3238.0) \n\n(a) Projection Series B has been used for the period 2017-2019.\n\n(b) An age heaping adjustment was applied to derive final 30 June 2016 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander\npopulation estimates for the Northern Territory. This information was published in Estimates of Aboriginal\nand Torres Strait Islander Australians, June 2016 (cat. no. 3238.0.55.001) and has been used as the base\npopulation for compiling estimates and projections for this release.\n\n(c) Includes Other Territories.\n\nIndigenous enrolment rate estimates \n\nAs Australia’s federal electoral roll does not have a personal Indigenous identifier, estimating the \nenrolment rates for Indigenous persons is problematic, however, having this key franchise KPI for \nthe Indigenous population is important for Closing the Gap purposes and the AECs focus on how \nthe franchise could be better delivered. \n\nIn 2014 the AEC’s Research Section commenced indirect estimation of these figures, using a \nregression model of the relationship between the Indigenous population and each of the three \nfranchise KPIs at a small area level, such as polling place catchment or the ABS’ SA2 geography. \n\nLS7888 Released Document No. 29Released under the Freedom of Information Act 1982\fWhile the models did not fit the data particularly well, the resulting Indigenous enrolment rates \nwere statistically based on real data, rather than anecdote. Yet the resulting enrolment and turnout \nrates in particular were alarmingly low, and hopefully represented a worst case picture. \n\nCurrent method \n\nThe Centrelink client file with Indigenous indicator available to the AEC annually since 2017 has \npresented an excellent opportunity, via matching to the Roll and mark-off data, to improve \nestimation of Indigenous franchise KPIs.  \n\nWhile the results are subject to a number of non-trivial assumptions, the more direct estimation \nmethods lead to a higher likelihood of robust results. The figures should nevertheless still be \nregarded as indicative only. \n\nAs part of the Annual Roll Integrity Review (ARIR), the person-level matching between the Roll and \nCentrelink now includes Centrelink’s Indigenous indicator. However, as Centrelink customers \nrepresent only around half of the Roll, the matching (even if perfect) would be far from assigning all \nenrolments an Indigenous flag. Nevertheless, for the first time the AEC has a very large number of \nenrolled persons, over 6 million, matched to Centrelink records with an explicit Indigenous status. \n\nThe enrolment rate, even for all persons regardless of indigeneity, is difficult to calculate reliably \ndue to conceptual, collection and methodological differences between the Roll (numerator) and the \nABS-based enrolment-eligible population (denominator, “EEP”). In the case of the Indigenous \npopulation these problems are magnified by having no Indigenous identifier on the Roll and less \nreliable estimates of Indigenous EEP.  \n\nHowever, matching the Roll to Centrelink data allows a more direct method of estimating the \nIndigenous enrolment rate. Results for 30 June 2018 are provided in Table 2. \n\nTable 2 - Estimated Indigenous Enrolment Rates, 30 June 2018 \n\nState \n\nEstimated \nIndigenous voting \nage population \n\nEstimated enrolled \n\nEstimated not \nenrolled \n\nEstimated enrolment \nrate \n\nNSW \n\nVIC \n\nQLD \n\nWA \n\nSA \n\nTAS \n\nACT \n\nNT \n\n164,845 \n\n36,538 \n\n135,642 \n\n64,545 \n\n26,522 \n\n18,004 \n\n5,000 \n\n50,563 \n\n143,891 \n\n27,775 \n\n98,357 \n\n41,182 \n\n18,622 \n\n15,150 \n\n3,971 \n\n34,130 \n\nAustralia \n\n501,659 \n\n383,078 \n\n20,954 \n\n8,763 \n\n37,285 \n\n23,363 \n\n7,900 \n\n2,854 \n\n1,029 \n\n16,433 \n\n118,581 \n\n87.3% \n\n76.0% \n\n72.5% \n\n63.8% \n\n70.2% \n\n84.1% \n\n79.4% \n\n67.5% \n\n76.4% \n\nIt is still subject to quite courageous assumptions, but as fewer are required it likely represents an \nimproved approach. In summary: \n\n  For all Centrelink customers with an identified Indigenous or non-Indigenous status, \n\ncalculate the proportion on the Roll. This is the raw enrolment rate of Centrelink clients. \n  Calculate the ratio of the actual AEC enrolment rate versus the Centrelink-based rate, for \nthe same point in time. This is the overall factor to adjust any Centrelink-based rates to \nalign with AEC enrolment rates. \n\n  Apply the adjustment factor to raw Centrelink-based enrolment rates by Indigenous status \n\nto give Indigenous and non-Indigenous enrolment rates. \n\nLS7888 Released Document No. 29Released under the Freedom of Information Act 1982 \n\f  This process can be done at the State level, though results will have lower reliability. \n\nIt should be noted that while this method avoids indirectly modelling Indigenous enrolment rates via \ngeographic association, it does assume that any bias in Centrelink clients being enrolled is equal \nfor Indigenous and non-Indigenous, and that there are no substantive Indigenous-status biases \ninherent in the Roll-to-Centrelink person matching. \n\nCentrelink data \n\nThe number of Indigenous Australians that are identified both on the Centrelink file sent to the AEC \nin July 2018 and the electoral Roll does not represent all Indigenous enrolments. It is limited to \nthose Indigenous Australians who both receive a Centrelink benefit and who have self-identified as \nIndigenous to Centrelink. \n\nAfter considerable data cleansing and analysis the AEC identified 72,451 potentially unenrolled \nIndigenous Australians. This represents around 61 per cent of the 118,581 Indigenous Australians \nthe AEC estimate were not enrolled as at 30 June 2018 (see Table 2 above). \n\nThe enrolment stimulation event conducted in February/March 2019 using 2018 Centrelink data \nresulted in the enrolment of 2,646 people who indicated they were Indigenous. This reduced the \nestimated number of unenrolled Indigenous Australians identified in the Centrelink dataset to \n69,143. Table 3 sets out the distribution of this cohort across states and Table 4 provides the data \nfor electoral divisions. \n\nIt is important to note that the potential unenrolled under 65 Indigenous Australians as at the 2019 \nclose of rolls represents those people that are on the Centrelink file sent to the AEC in July 2018 \nand who were included in the February 2019 enrolment stimulation event but had not enrolled as at \nthe 2019 close of rolls (18 April 2019). \n\nAnalysis of the Centrelink potentially unenrolled Indigenous Australians 65 years and older \nidentified significant matching error, due to the quality of data input and the nature of the residential \nstatus of this cohort. Work will be undertaken on the 2019 dataset to better understand this \nphenomenon to facilitate better targeting of potentially unenrolled indigenous Australians in the \nfuture. \n\nTable 3 –
