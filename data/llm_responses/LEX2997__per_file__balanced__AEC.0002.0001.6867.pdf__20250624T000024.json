For electoral matter authorised by a natural person or an entity, required particulars include the name and relevant town/city of the authorising person or entity, and in some cases, the printer's details. Non-compliance is subject to civil penalties.\n*   **Section 321F - Electoral Commissioner may obtain information and documents from persons:** This section empowers the Electoral Commissioner to issue written notices requiring individuals or entities to provide information or documents relevant to assessing compliance with Section 321D.\n\n**Relevance to the FOI Request:**\n\nThis document provides the legal framework underpinning the AEC's investigation into Andrew Laming MP's Facebook pages. Section 321D specifies the authorisation requirements that Laming's pages were alleged to have violated by operating without mandatory disclosures while promoting political content. Section 321F directly relates to the AEC's investigative process, explaining the legal basis for the formal notices issued to Laming for information and to third parties like Facebook for data, as described in the FOI request overview."

Do not include any conversational filler or preamble.To aid you, the overview of the FOI request is: [REQUEST OVERVIEW START] The FOI request disclosed documents detailing the Australian Electoral Commission's (AEC) investigation into Andrew Laming MP's Facebook pages for compliance with federal electoral authorisation laws. This inquiry was triggered by public complaints and media reports, notably from *The Guardian*, alleging Laming used numerous pages (e.g., \"Redland Bay Bulletin,\" \"Redlands Institute\") disguised as community or news groups to promote political content and attack opponents without mandatory disclosures. The AEC confirmed an active investigation, noting 2018 Electoral Act amendments broadened social media authorisation, and issued formal notices to Laming for detailed information and to third parties (like Facebook) for data, with Facebook confirming its cooperation. Findings revealed some pages were removed or updated with authorisation, while others remained active and unauthorised.\n [REQUEST OVERVIEW END] \n\n--- MAIN DOCUMENT TEXT START ---\n\n\n\n--- Page 1 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 2 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 3 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 4 ---\n\nAEC.0002.0001.6870\n\nCjAEC Australian Electoral Commission • ATTACHMENT A 321D Authorisation of certain electoral matter (1) This section applies in relation to electoral matter that is communicated to a person if: (a) all of the following apply: (i) the matter is an electoral advertisement; (ii) all or part of the distribution or production of the advertisement was paid for; (iii) the content of the advertisement was approved by a person (the notifying entity) (whether or not that person is a person who paid for the distribution or production of the advertisement); or Notifying particulars (5) The notifying entity must.ensure that the particulars set out in the following table, and any other particulars determined under subsection (7) for the purposes of this subsection, are notified in accordance with any requirements determined under that subsection.
