  "prompt": "From a government skeptic's viewpoint, provide a concise, single-paragraph summary in markdown format of the following FOI request overview:\n\nSummary:\n\nA formal Freedom of Information request was lodged and granted for the 2023 Referendum Writ. While the document indicates \"Release in full\" with \"N/A\" for exemptions, suggesting transparency, it simultaneously highlights potential bureaucratic inefficiency. The writ is explicitly noted as \"available at aec.gov.au,\" raising questions about why a formal FOI process was necessary to access a document that should be proactively and readily available without administrative hurdles. This points to a system where citizens may be forced into formal requests for basic public information, rather than a genuine commitment to effortless public access and proactive disclosure. The \"transparency\" demonstrated is merely the bare minimum fulfillment of a request for a fundamentally public document, rather than an indicator of robust, proactive openness regarding government operations.\n\nProvide only the markdown formatted summary text. Do not include any conversational filler or preamble."
