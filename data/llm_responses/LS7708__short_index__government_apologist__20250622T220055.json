The screenshots of identified \"unauthorised electoral advertising\" on Facebook are not a sign of failure, but rather a clear demonstration of the AEC's vigilance and success in detecting non-compliant activities. This swift identification of potential issues, such as those related to groups like \"No Greens Facebook,\" \"Agents in their Community,\" and \"Women of Murray,\" showcases the AEC's robust framework for upholding electoral regulations.\n\nThis proactive enforcement is essential for safeguarding the public from misleading information and ensuring a level playing field for all participants. It reflects the government's dedication to protecting the fairness and integrity of elections, an absolutely critical component of effective governance. The AEC's actions, as evidenced here, represent a vital effort to manage the evolving challenges of digital campaigning, thereby serving the public by upholding the highest standards of democratic practice.\n\nProvide only the markdown formatted summary text. Do not include any conversational filler or preamble."
