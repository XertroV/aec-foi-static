            "text": "This document details Grahame Bowland's independent initiative to verify Australian Senate election counts using custom-developed Python software. Within the context of the FOI request, this document serves as a concrete example of how private citizens, driven by rational self-interest in understanding and verifying critical processes, confront government opacity and overreach.\n\n**Summary of Document:**\n\nThe document is an internal AEC communication attaching a blog post by Grahame Bowland, a member of the WA Greens, detailing his development of open-source Python code (`dividebatur`) to independently replicate and verify the complex Single Transferable Vote (STV) distribution process used in the Western Australian Senate election. Bowland undertook this project because the AEC's official software was closed-source and no public alternatives existed for verification. He meticulously studied the Commonwealth Electoral Act, obtained a detailed run log from the AEC, and used publicly available data to successfully reproduce the AEC's results. He also analyzed hypothetical scenarios, including the impact of the 1370 \"lost\" votes. Although he found no fault in the AEC's software's calculations, his work highlighted significant transparency issues and the difficulty of independent verification.\n\n**Analysis from an Objectivist Perspective:**\n\n1.  **Reason:**\n    *   **Reflection:** Bowland's endeavor is a profound testament to the value of reason. He approached a complex, critical problem (electoral integrity) with a systematic, objective, and rigorous methodology. His decision to write his own software, to study dense legislation, to use rational number representations for precision, and to conduct functional tests demonstrates a commitment to truth and objective verification. He applied his intellect to understand, replicate, and validate a process that directly impacts individual rights and the rule of law. His pursuit of \"no fault\" (finding errors) illustrates a dispassionate search for truth, transcending potential partisan leanings.\n    *   **Contradiction:** The AEC's reliance on closed-source software and initially inadequate public documentation represents a fundamental abandonment of reason in government. By obscuring the internal workings of a crucial democratic process, the AEC hinders rational inquiry and independent verification, effectively asking citizens to accept their results on faith rather than through demonstrable proof. This opacity creates an environment where error or even malfeasance could go undetected, undermining the very foundation of an objective, verifiable system.\n\n2.  **Individualism:**\n    *   **Reflection:** Bowland's actions are a powerful embodiment of individualism. He acted as a sovereign individual, taking personal responsibility for understanding and validating a governmental process. He did not rely on the state to provide transparency but instead applied his own skills, time (\"two long nights of work\"), and intellectual effort to create a solution. His independent development and open-source sharing (under an Apache license) of his software demonstrate self-reliance, initiative, and the productive achievement of an individual pursuing his values. He made his work publicly available, empowering other individuals to engage in independent verification.\n    *   **Contradiction:** The AEC's conduct contradicts individualism by creating bureaucratic obstacles that deter or impede individual inquiry and accountability. The closed-source nature of their software and the delayed release of crucial data effectively assert that the individual is not competent or permitted to fully verify government actions, thereby subordinating individual judgment and the right to transparency to bureaucratic authority.\n\n3.  **Free Enterprise (and Productive Achievement):**\n    *   **Reflection:** Bowland's creation of the `dividebatur` software is a significant productive achievement. He identified a need (software for independent verification), applied his expertise (Python coding, algorithm implementation), and created a valuable, functional product that serves as a tool for transparency and analysis. His decision to make it open-source and encourage further development (\"I would love to see some great animations appear from this data!\") aligns with the principles of free intellectual exchange and the productive creation of value. While not a commercial enterprise, it exemplifies the creation of a useful \"product\" driven by individual initiative and expertise.\n    *   **Contradiction:** The AEC's use of closed-source software and the deliberate withholding of timely data constitute a bureaucratic obstacle to free enterprise and productive achievement in the realm of electoral technology and oversight. By monopolizing the verification process through proprietary means, the government stifles innovation, independent development of competing or superior solutions, and the natural market for tools that could enhance transparency and accountability. It prevents other skilled individuals or entities from freely entering this domain to offer their services or improvements, thereby suppressing potential productive achievement outside of government control.\n\n**Evidence of Bureaucratic Obstacles, Forced Altruism, or Suppression of Productive Achievement:**\n\n*   **Bureaucratic Obstacles:**\n    *   **Closed-Source Software:** The AEC's refusal to make its electoral distribution software public created the primary obstacle, forcing Bowland to \"replicate\" rather than simply audit or verify.\n    *   **Inadequate Public Documentation:** The need for \"much late night study of the Commonwealth Electoral Act\" (described as \"a pretty awful means to document an algorithm\") highlights the AEC's failure to provide clear, accessible documentation for public understanding and verification.\n    *   **Delayed Data Release:** The AEC \"did not make the data available until a couple of hours after they ran the count and declared the result,\" intentionally hindering timely independent analysis and pre-declaration verification.\n    *   **Lost Votes:** The AEC \"lost 1370 votes,\" a systemic failure indicative of bureaucratic incompetence or negligence that undermines the integrity of the process and necessitates independent efforts to account for such errors.\n\n*   **Forced Altruism:** There is no direct evidence of forced altruism. Bowland's efforts appear to be self-initiated and driven by his own rational values, not by coercion or a mandate to sacrifice his interests for the collective. His choice to make his work open-source is a voluntary act of benevolence, not a forced one.\n\n*   **Suppression of Productive Achievement:** While the AEC did not actively *prevent* Bowland from creating his software once he started, their operational opacity and closed-source approach inherently *suppressed* productive achievement by making it unnecessarily difficult, time-consuming, and requiring extraordinary individual effort to perform a task that should be transparent and easily verifiable by design. This governmental behavior stifles the spontaneous emergence of independent tools and solutions that could enhance electoral integrity."

  "prompt": "From an Objectivist perspective, summarize this specific document within the context of the FOI request. Analyze how the document reflects or contradicts the values of reason, individualism, and free enterprise. Note any evidence of bureaucratic obstacles, forced altruism, or suppression of productive achievement.\n\nTo aid you, the overview of the FOI request is: [REQUEST OVERVIEW START] These FOI documents starkly illustrate how individual initiative, driven by rational self-interest and productive achievement, stands in sharp contrast to government overreach and opacity. Private citizens, by independently developing verification software and rigorously analyzing electoral processes, exemplified the virtue of reason in seeking truth and ensuring system integrity. Conversely, the government's use of closed-source software, systemic errors, and the deliberate suppression of information by the AEC represent a profound violation of individual rights, transparency, and the rule of law. Such bureaucratic actions actively undermine personal freedom and productive achievement by creating an unpredictable, unaccountable system, thereby subverting the government's sole legitimate function: the protection of individual liberties through a transparent and objective framework.\n [REQUEST OVERVIEW END] \n\n--- MAIN DOCUMENT TEXT START ---\n\n\n\n--- Page 1 ---\n\nFrom:\nTo:\nSubject:\nDate:\nAttachments:\n\nFor Information: Independent test of senate counts [SEC=UNCLASSIFIED]\nWednesday, 20 July 2016 2:52:00 PM\nimage001.gif\nimage002.gif\n\nUNCLASSIFIED\n\nAs discussed a member of the WA Greens, Grahame Bowland, wrote python code to\nreplicate the Senate count. He found no issue with the AEC results. It was a completely\nindependent activity, using the legislation as a source, and comparing to the distribution of\npreferences (I think that is what he is referring to).\n\nHis blog post on the matter is not available through the SOE, so I’ve replicated the text\nbelow. For reference, the software is still hosted on GitHub here:\nhttps://github.com/grahame/dividebatur\n\nCounting the West Australian Senate Election\n\nPosted on January 25, 2014 by Grahame Bowland\n\ntl;dr – check out angrygoats.net/wasenate/ to see the full details of the WA senate election distribution – precisely\nhow the count was processed by the AEC for both the initial count (#14votes) and the recount, and to see what\nhappens if the “lost” votes are added back in, assuming they were counted right the first time. grab the code and\nrun the distribution yourself, it’s over on github.\n\nWestern Australia went to the polls with the rest of the country on September 7 2013, but failed to clearly elect six\nsenators. When the votes were tallied a crucial exclusion on a margin of 14 votes was the difference between the\nelection of Scott Ludlam (Greens) and Wayne Dropulich (Sports Party), or Louise Pratt (ALP) and Zhenya Wang\n(Palmer). The ALP & Palmer won on this count, but no result was declared and a recount was conducted.\nAfter the initial count, several people asked me how the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) processed the\ndistribution of preferences, and whether there was a way to verify it. To my surprise the AEC software which takes\nall above-the-line and below-the-line votes and runs a Single Transferable Vote (STV) distribution is closed source\nand not available for download. I was unable to find any publicly available software to run the count. This made it\nextremely difficult to verify the correctness of AEC’s results.\nWhile the recount was going on I got to work on some software to process the distribution. This was greatly helped\nby a detailed run log from the AEC’s software I managed to obtain. This told me exactly how the AEC’s software ran\nthe distribution, including totals of votes for each candidate at each count, and precisely when candidates were\nelected and excluded.\nSTV is really a family of voting systems – some details vary between jurisdictions. The information I could find on\nthe AEC website on how to process the distribution was adequate only for educational purposes, and did not go into\nthe fine details. This lead to much late night study of the Commonwealth Electoral Act. A bill of Parliament is a\npretty awful means to document an algorithm, but everything needed is in Part XVIII.\nThe AEC publish all the data necessary to run a count on their Senate downloads page. It is simply a matter of\ntaking the number of above-the-line (ticket) votes and counting these votes as that number of papers following the\nparty’s ticket(s). They also publish the form of every below-the-line paper lodged. Add those papers into one\ncollection and you have all the information necessary to run the distribution, and determine who the elected\ncandidates are.\nIn two long nights of work, I was able to get this done – exactly reproducing the AEC’s results in my software. The\ncode was pretty rough and ready, but I had functional tests which checked my results matched the AEC’s. Being\nafraid of rounding errors I made sure to stick with rational number representations of transfer values, and was\nslightly hopeful this might turn up a minor error in the AEC’s software. Disappointingly, but reassuringly, I found no\nfault at all in the AEC’s software.\nThe AEC published above-the-line vote counts as the recount progressed. This made me hopeful I’d be able to run\na count myself once the recount was complete and know the result before the official distribution was run.\nUnfortunately they did not enter the changes to the below-the-line votes (ballots rescued from the informal pile) until\nthe last day, and did not make the data available until a couple of hours after they ran the count and declared the\nresult. Gratifyingly my software agreed with theirs, the election now tipping to Scott Ludlam and Wayne Dropulich,\nthe same crucial exclusion now going 12 votes the other way.\nOf course, the AEC lost 1370 votes which were not included in the recount. The preferences of those votes as\ninterpreted during the first count were published by the AEC, making it simple to add them back into the recount.\nThis swings the crucial exclusion back to a margin of 1 vote, electing Louise Pratt and Zhenya Wang. It’s impossible\nto know if these votes would have stood as they did if scrutinised again, and votes may also have come back from\n\n\n--- Page 2 ---\n\nlost informal votes.\nThe full senate vote distribution for these three scenarios can be viewed in detail. You can flick through the counts\none-by-one, or the summary page for each scenario will link you to the count in which any given candidate was\nelected or excluded.\nMy software outputs JSON data descr bing the distribution process, and the user interface is an\nangularjs application which presents that JSON data. If anyone is interested in analysis or visualisation of the full\ndistribution (as opposed to a simplified distribution only including above-the-line votes) the JSON files are linked for\ndownload. I would love to see some great animations appear from this data!\nIf you want to check out the code behind this, it’s over on github. I have named the project dividebatur (Latin for\n‘distribution’) and it is open source under the Apache license. If you’re interested in the STV algorithm itself, it’s\nimplemented in these 700 lines of Python code (hopefully quite readable).\nI learnt a bunch of surprising things implementing the distribution. A bundle of “x” papers distributed at a given\ntransfer value translates into a “x” times the transfer value votes, rounded down. This means that occasionally votes\nwill be “lost” to rounding. What I didn’t realise is that those votes can also come back – if those papers are\ndistributed in an exclusion, they may break by next preference in a way that avoids the rounding issue. Subtle\ndetails like this (and split group voting tickets, exclusion tie resolution, …) were tricky to get right!\nIn conclusion, we’ve now got some software which lets us as voters verify that the rather complex senate\ndistribution is correct, and study hypothetical scenarios if we want to. It is easy to determine what would happen if a\nparty changed their ticket vote in a particular way, or consider what would happen if a state-that-shall-not-be-named\nstuffed up their senate election. I hope you find it useful, and please send me feedback and/or patches!\n@angrygoat on twitter or grahame@angrygoats.net.\nDisclosure: I’m a member of The Greens (WA). I don’t believe anything in this post is partisan, and I am speaking\nfor myself. My software is open source and can be verified at your leisure :-)\n\n| Senior Research Officer\n\nStrategic Research & Analysis Section | Roll Management Branch\nAustralian Electoral Commission\n\nUNCLASSIFIED\n\nProvide only the markdown formatted summary text.
