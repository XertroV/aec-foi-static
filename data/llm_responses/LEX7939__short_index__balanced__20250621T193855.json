While the current total number of designated electors was referenced as available on their website rather than directly provided, the AEC reported 211 new declarations in FY2024/25 to date, a notable increase from previous years, with all declarations made by a delegate of the Electoral Commissioner. The request also revealed a small number of internal review applications (four in FY2022/23 and four in FY2024/25), predominantly resulting in confirmed decisions, though one was set aside in FY2024/25. No applications for review to the Administrative Review Tribunal or instances of declarations ceasing effect under s 202AH(3) were recorded for the specified periods."
