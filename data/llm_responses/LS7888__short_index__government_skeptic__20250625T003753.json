Crucial details on costs, staffing, and design involvement were withheld, while public-facing documents spun \"steady\" enrolment rates by omitting the absolute increase in unenrolled Indigenous Australians. Internal communications reveal a \"new methodology\" based on \"courageous assumptions\" and \"estimates on top of estimates,\" explicitly acknowledged as not \"100% accurate\"—a direct contradiction to public claims of robustness—and yielding a dismal 3.65% enrolment conversion rate from targeted outreach. This selective reporting, coupled with the refusal to share granular data and the program's reliance on a flawed workaround for the absence of an Indigenous identifier, highlights a systemic failure to transparently and effectively address Indigenous electoral participation, prioritizing managed appearances over genuine accountability."

  "prompt": "From a government skeptic's viewpoint, provide a concise, single-paragraph summary in markdown format of the following FOI request overview:\n\nSummary:\n\nThe released FOI documents concerning the Australian Electoral Commission's (AEC) new methodology for its Indigenous Electoral Participation Program (IEPP) in 2018-2019 reveal a pervasive lack of transparency, questionable data practices, and a clear attempt to manage public perception rather than fully disclose operational realities.\n\n**Lack of Transparency and Selective Reporting:**\n\n*   **Withheld Information:** Despite the FOI request explicitly asking for final costs, the number of staff assigned, and the number of Indigenous people involved in the program's design, *none* of this crucial information has been provided. This is a significant red flag, indicating a deliberate effort to shield the financial and human resource investment of the program from public scrutiny.\n*   **Controlled Narrative:** While public-facing documents (like the \"Estimates Briefs\" for parliamentary review) highlight a \"steady\" national Indigenous enrolment rate (e.g., 76.6% in 2019) and frame it as an \"increase on previous estimates,\" internal communications reveal a more problematic reality. The public narrative focuses on the *rate*, conveniently omitting that the *absolute number* of estimated unenrolled Indigenous Australians actually *increased* between 2018 and 2019 (from 118,581 to 123,601).\n*   **Downplaying Negative Results:** Internal emails show AEC staff attempting to rationalize significant increases in unenrolled Indigenous populations in specific states (e.g., NSW's 10.9% increase in unenrolled individuals), dismissing them as \"not statistically significant\" or a function of \"state size.\" This internal spin contrasts sharply with the positive external messaging.\n*   **Granular Data Withheld:** Senior AEC officials explicitly state that detailed, divisional breakdowns of \"potentially unenrolled Indigenous Australians\" are not \"comfortable sharing\" externally due to a \"greater risk of error.\" This suggests that the AEC prefers to present only high-level, generalized data, potentially concealing less flattering localized outcomes or the inherent imprecision of their new method.\n\n**Questionable Data Practices and Inefficiencies:**\n\n*   **Methodological Limitations:** The \"new methodology\" (which relies on matching electoral roll data with Centrelink's self-identified Indigeneity data) is internally acknowledged as based on \"courageous assumptions\" and \"estimates on top of estimates.\" A Deputy Electoral Commissioner explicitly warned that the data \"is not and cannot be considered 100% accurate,\" urging that these caveats \"not be lost over time\" in ministerial briefings. This internal admission of significant data unreliability stands in stark contrast to the public claim of \"more robust data.\"\n*   **Historical Data Unreliability:** Documents admit that previous 2014 estimates of Indigenous enrolment were \"alarmingly low, and hopefully represented a worst case picture,\" and that \"the models did not fit the data particularly well.\" This implies a long-standing issue with the AEC's ability to accurately measure Indigenous enrolment, raising questions about the efficacy of past programs and the true \"improvement\" claimed by the new methodology.\n*   **Ineffective Outreach:** A \"stimulation event\" conducted in early 2019, targeting 72,451 \"potentially unenrolled Indigenous Australians\" identified through the new method, resulted in only 2,646 new Indigenous enrolments. This represents a dismal conversion rate of approximately 3.65%, highlighting a severe inefficiency in the program's ability to translate \"improved\" data into actual increased enrolment.\n*   **Ongoing Data Issues:** Even during the 2019 reporting period, internal emails show staff \"reviewing the numbers\" and admitting that the \"comparison between 2019 and 2018 looks strange and we just fixed this.\" This suggests that the methodology was still unstable and subject to last-minute corrections, undermining claims of its robustness.\n*   **Fundamental Systemic Flaw:** The core problem, as admitted in multiple documents, is the absence of a \"personal Indigenous identifier\" on the federal electoral roll. The \"new methodology\" is merely a workaround, not a fundamental solution, perpetually relying on external, imperfect data sources.\n\nIn summary, the documents paint a picture of an AEC struggling to measure and improve Indigenous electoral participation, relying on a method fraught with internal caveats and data quality issues. Instead of full disclosure, the AEC appears to engage in selective reporting and internal spin to present a more favorable image to ministers and the public, while essential details about the program's cost and staffing remain shrouded in secrecy. This demonstrates a concerning pattern of opacity and a focus on managing public perception over transparent accountability for government programs.\n\nProvide only the markdown formatted summary text. Do not include any conversational filler or preamble.\n"
