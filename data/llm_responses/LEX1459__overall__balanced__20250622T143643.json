(the Party) \n\nPurpose \n\nThis minute asks you, as a delegate of the Electoral Commission, to deregister the Party under \ns 137(6) of the Electoral Act on the grounds that the Party does not have at least 1,500 members \n(s 137(1)(b) of the Electoral Act).  \n\nAuthority \n\nSections 123, 137, 138 and 138A of the Electoral Act. \n\nBackground \n\nOn 13 January 2022, you, as a delegate of the Electoral Commission, issued a notice to the \nRegistered Officer of the Party, Mr Nathan Spataro, under s 137 of the Electoral Act (the s 137 \nNotice) stating that the Electoral Commission is considering deregistering the Party (OBJECT IDs: \nA1319272 and A1442167). The Registered Officer of the Party had until 13 February 2022 to provide \na response.  \n\nOn 13 February 2022, the Party responded to the s 137 Notice: \n\n•  Response received – OBJECT ID: A1369037 \n•  Statement – OBJECT ID: A1369035 \n•  Supplementary membership list – OBJECT ID: A1369039 \n\nOn 2 March 2022, you, as a delegate of the Electoral Commission, having considered the statement \nlodged by the Party, and membership list lodged in support of that statement containing 4,680 \nnames, requested that further membership testing be performed. In confirming your advice, you \ninstructed to select the top 1,650 names for testing to conform with the AEC’s testing methodology \nparameters. Please see OBJECT ID: A1406912. \n\nMinute  \n\nPage 1\n\n\n--- Page 2 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 3 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 4 ---\n\nOFFICIAL \n\nApplication to change the Party’s name, abbreviation and logo in the Register \n\nOn 19 February 2022, the Party lodged an application in accordance with s 134 of the Electoral Act \nto change its name, abbreviation and logo in the Register (OBJECT ID: A1396302). The Party’s logo \npassed validation and has been assessed by CRE8IVE (OBJECT IDs: A1421693 and A1421695). If \nthe Party is deregistered, the application lodged under s 134 of the Electoral Act will no longer be \nvalid. \n\nConclusion \n\nOn 13 January 2022, a notice was issued a notice to the Registered Officer of the Party under s 137 \nof the Electoral Act stating that the Electoral Commission is considering deregistering the Party \n\nOn 13 February 2022, the party responded to the s 137 Notice providing a statement and a \nmembership list in support of that statement. \n\nAn assessment of the Party’s membership list was undertaken and based on the ABS methodology it \ndemonstrated that the Party has failed to demonstrate to have at least 1,500 members.  \n\nAccordingly, there are reasonable grounds on which you, as the delegate of the Electoral \nCommission, can be satisfied that the Party does not have at least 1,500 members. Based on this \ninformation, you may determine under s 138A of the Electoral Act that the Party is not an ‘eligible \npolitical party’ and should be deregistered. \n\nIf you, as the delegate of the Electoral Commission is of this view, you should not deregister the \nParty under s 137 of the Electoral Act and advise the Registered Officer of this decision.  \n\nMinute  \n\nPage 4\n\n\n--- Page 5 ---\n\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 1 ---\n\n\n\nProvide only the markdown formatted summary text.
