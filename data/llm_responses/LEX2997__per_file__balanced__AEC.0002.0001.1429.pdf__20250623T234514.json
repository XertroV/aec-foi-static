  "prompt": "Considering this document as part of an FOI request, summarize the document and its relevance to the FOI request in markdown format. Provide only the markdown formatted summary text. Do not include any conversational filler or preamble.To aid you, the overview of the FOI request is: [REQUEST OVERVIEW START] The FOI request disclosed documents detailing the Australian Electoral Commission's (AEC) investigation into Andrew Laming MP's Facebook pages for compliance with federal electoral authorisation laws. This inquiry was triggered by public complaints and media reports, notably from *The Guardian*, alleging Laming used numerous pages (e.g., \"Redland Bay Bulletin,\" \"Redlands Institute\") disguised as community or news groups to promote political content and attack opponents without mandatory disclosures. The AEC confirmed an active investigation, noting 2018 Electoral Act amendments broadened social media authorisation, and issued formal notices to Laming for detailed information and to third parties (like Facebook) for data, with Facebook confirming its cooperation. Findings revealed some pages were removed or updated with authorisation, while others remained active and unauthorised.\n [REQUEST OVERVIEW END] \n\n--- MAIN DOCUMENT TEXT START ---\n\n\n\n--- Page 1 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 2 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 3 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 4 ---\n\nAEC.0002.0001.1432\n\nGuardian Australia have published our response to their media enquiry regarding MP Andrew Laming Facebook accounts today.  Please see a screen shot of the article below. I wouldnâ€™t usually interrupt your busy schedule to notify you about the media enquiries we receive, however, there has been a fair amount of media coverage regarding Andrew Laming recently and I thought I would alert you that the Guardian has referenced the AEC and that we will be investigating the requirement for authorisation.  This email is just for your awareness. Please let me know if you require any further information. Kind regards, Holly\n\n\n--- Page 5 ---\n\n\n\n"
