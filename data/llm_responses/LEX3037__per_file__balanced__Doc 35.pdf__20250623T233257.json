The email confirms receipt of a report from the AEC regarding a \"Polling Place Video\" and states that TikTok's teams have received the report and will conduct a review, promising to follow up once completed.\n\n**Relevance to FOI Request LEX3037:**\nThis email directly illustrates the \"extensive communication\" and \"direct communication channels and content referrals\" between the AEC and major tech companies, as highlighted in the FOI request overview. It provides specific evidence of the AEC, likely via its Electoral Integrity Assurance Taskforce, proactively engaging with TikTok during the 2022 federal election period to report and address potentially non-compliant content or electoral misinformation/disinformation related to polling places. TikTok's response confirms the operational aspect of this collaboration, demonstrating the mechanism by which the AEC sought to safeguard election integrity by flagging concerning content for platform review."
