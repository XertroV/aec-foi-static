            "text": "### Document Summary\nThis document is an email from Pat Callanan of the Australian Electoral Commission's (AEC) Communications Section, dated May 21, 2022 (election day). It is addressed to \"Social Media\" (implicitly TikTok, given the video link) and carbon-copied to various AEC sections, including the Electoral Integrity Assurance Taskforce (EIAT). The email refers a video posted on TikTok that was filmed inside a polling place without permission, potentially identifies an AEC staff member, and contains disinformation accusing the AEC of rigging the election. The AEC requests swift action to remove the video, stating it breaches \"Integrity and Authenticity Policy\" and \"Privacy, Personal Data, & Personally Identifiable Info Policy\" (likely referring to the platform's policies).\n\n### Relevance to FOI Request LEX3037\nThis document directly exemplifies the AEC's proactive engagement and \"Electoral Communications Escalation Scenarios\" outlined in FOI request LEX3037. It demonstrates a specific instance of the AEC's Electoral Integrity Assurance Taskforce (EIAT) using direct communication channels with a major tech company (TikTok) to:\n*   Identify and monitor electoral misinformation/disinformation (\"accusing the AEC of rigging the election\").\n*   Address non-compliant content (filming without permission, identifying staff).\n*   Request content removal, thereby safeguarding election integrity during the 2022 federal election.\n\nThis email serves as tangible evidence of the collaboration and content referral mechanisms between the AEC and tech platforms described in the FOI request overview."
