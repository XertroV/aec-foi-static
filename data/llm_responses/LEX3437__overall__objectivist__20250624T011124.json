            "text": "As an Objectivist, I analyze these Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) documents through the lens of individual rights, rational self-interest, productive achievement, and the inherent dangers of collectivism and government overreach. What is revealed is a pervasive system that systematically subordinates the individual to the collective, stifles personal initiative, and enforces a rigid, bureaucratic conformity.\n\n**Primacy of Individual Rights and Liberty: A Systematic Erosion**\n\nThe documents reveal a profound violation of fundamental individual rights, particularly freedom of speech and bodily autonomy.\n\n1.  **Suppression of Political Expression:** The \"Acknowledgement and declaration of key obligations\" and \"Letter of engagement\" explicitly demand \"political neutrality\" as a \"condition of my engagement.\" Employees \"do not intend to publicly engage in such activities\" and must \"discuss the matter with [their] manager/supervisor immediately\" if they wish to. Failure to comply can result in \"sanction, including termination of your employment.\" This is an egregious assault on individual liberty, forcing employees to suppress their personal convictions and right to political association. The \"APS1 Induction and training booklet\" further reinforces this, extending the censorship to \"private use of IT systems and social media,\" dictating that \"Your actions online must not conflict with the AEC’s political impartiality requirement.\" This means an individual's life outside of work is controlled by the state, a hallmark of totalitarian thinking, not a free society.\n2.  **Violation of Bodily Autonomy:** The \"Letter of engagement\" states, \"It is a condition of engagement with the AEC that you comply with the AEC’s COVID-19 Vaccination Policy.\" This is a direct, coercive government mandate that infringes upon an individual's right to control their own body. \"Failure to Meet a Condition of Engagement... your employment may be terminated.\" This exemplifies the state using its power to enforce medical conformity, a deeply alarming instance of government overreach.\n3.  **Lack of Due Process:** The \"Procedures for Determining Breaches of the APS Code of Conduct\" notes that \"A formal hearing is not required,\" and while an employee may make a statement, a \"support person cannot speak or advocate on the employees behalf.\" This severely limits the individual's ability to defend themselves against accusations, undermining the very concept of a fair hearing and procedural justice.\n4.  **Restriction of Information Access:** The \"Public Engagement Team Handbook\" reveals a historical regression from principles of transparency. It notes that \"Prior to 2004 the roll was freely available for purchase,\" but \"After 2004, access to the roll was restricted and no longer provided to libraries.\" This demonstrates a deliberate move by the government to centralize and control information that was once publicly accessible, further eroding individual liberty and access to knowledge.\n\n**Rational Self-Interest and Productive Achievement: Subordinated to the Collective**\n\nObjectivism champions rational self-interest and productive achievement as virtues. These documents, however, reveal a bureaucratic environment antithetical to such principles.\n\n1.  **Forced Altruism and Collective Mandates:** The \"APS1 Induction and training booklet\" and \"National Induction Program\" emphasize adhering to \"APS Values\" and \"AEC values and commitments,\" which include \"Impartial,\" \"Committed to service,\" \"Accountable,\" \"Respectful,\" and \"Ethical.\" While some general ethical principles are admirable, when mandated by the state and enforced coercively (e.g., \"A breach of the Code of Conduct can result in sanctions, ranging from a reprimand to termination\"), they morph into demands for forced altruism and conformity to a collective identity (\"the integrity and good reputation of the employee’s Agency and the APS\"). The very purpose of the AEC is framed as \"maintaining an impartial and independent electoral system for eligible voters,\" a collective good that justifies extensive control over individual employees rather than fostering their unique productive potential.\n2.  **Suppression of Initiative:** The focus throughout is on rigid \"compliance with policies, procedures and legislation,\" \"following all AEC procedures at all times,\" and \"maintaining sound and up-to-date knowledge of electoral processes.\" While order is necessary, the overwhelming emphasis on adherence to predetermined rules stifles independent thought, innovation, and personal initiative. Employees are trained to be cogs in a machine, not self-directed producers.\n3.  **Surveillance and Mistrust:** The \"APS1 Induction and training booklet\" states, \"The AEC actively monitors computer and systems usage\" and that employees are \"personally responsible for securing your login and password details, and for all activity on the systems undertaken using your login.\" This, coupled with the chilling directive to \"report to your supervisor if you see a colleague doing anything that is a breach of the rules or is not appropriate,\" fosters a climate of suspicion and mistrust, undermining genuine collaboration and personal integrity. Employees are expected to prioritize bureaucratic adherence over individual discretion and loyalty. The prohibition on \"looking up a friend or colleague’s address\" on official systems further demonstrates this distrust, replacing rational discretion with rigid, impersonal rules.\n\n**Dangers of Collectivism and Government Overreach: A Bureaucratic Leviathan**\n\nThese documents offer a textbook case of government overreach and the insidious nature of collectivism within a supposedly democratic state.\n\n1.  **Pervasive Regulation and Control:** The sheer volume of legislation cited (*Public Service Act, Archives Act, Privacy Act, Crimes Act, Public Governance, Work Health and Safety Act, Commonwealth Electoral Act*) demonstrates a suffocating regulatory environment. Every aspect of an employee's professional and increasingly personal life is governed by a labyrinthine set of rules.\n2.  **Bureaucratic Indoctrination:** The \"National Induction Program\" is designed to \"set clear expectations\" and \"guide the performance and professional development of all staff, laying the foundations of the AEC’s working environment, agency values and agency expectations.\" Critically, it explicitly directs managers and trainers to \"refrain from voicing personal opinion on AEC policies, procedures and/or stakeholders during delivery\" and \"not amend or customise session content.\" This is institutionalized censorship and thought control, ensuring that only the state-approved narrative is disseminated, preventing any genuine critical assessment or intellectual independence.\n3.  **Social Engineering:** The inclusion of modules like \"Cultural Appreciation,\" \"Working with Indigenous Australians,\" and \"Diversity, culture and inclusion\" within mandatory training indicates the AEC is not merely a technical electoral body but an instrument for promoting specific social and political agendas, a gross misuse of government power that extends beyond its legitimate function of protecting individual rights.\n4.  **Monopoly and Inefficiency:** As a government monopoly, the AEC operates without the pressures of competition inherent in laissez-faire capitalism. While \"quality client service\" is mentioned, it is a forced directive rather than a market-driven outcome. The extensive, detailed procedures for everything from email management to complaints handling suggest a focus on bureaucratic process and control that often breeds inefficiency, rather than the streamlined, customer-focused productivity that emerges from free markets.\n\nIn summary, these documents paint a stark picture of a government agency that, in the name of \"impartiality\" and \"integrity,\" systematically undermines individual rights, stifles personal initiative, and enforces a collectivist ideology. They serve as a chilling reminder of the constant vigilance required to protect individual liberty from the encroaching power of the state."

The Electoral Commissioner is an \n\"Agency Head\" for the purposes of the Act (paragraph 29(2)(b) of the \nCommonwealth Electoral Act 1918). \n\nApplication \n1. Application of the Procedures \n1.1  The Procedures apply in determining whether an APS employee, has breached the Code in \n\nsection 13 of the Act.  \n\n1.2    In these Procedures, unless the contrary intention appears, a reference to: \n\na)  an APS employee includes reference to a former APS employee who is suspected of \n\nhaving breached the Code while an employee in the AEC; and  \n\nb)  a breach of the Code by a person includes a reference to a person engaging in conduct \n\nset out in subsection 15(2A) of the Act in connection with their engagement as an APS \n\nemployee. \n\n1.3. In accordance with subsection 15(7) of the Act, these procedures are publicly available on the \n\nAEC’s website. \n\nNote:   The Procedures apply only in relation to a suspected breach of the Code by an APS employee \n\nin respect of which a determination is to be made. Not all suspected breaches of the Code \nmay need to be dealt with by way of a determination. In particular circumstances, another \nway of dealing with a suspected breach of the Code may be more appropriate. \n\nThese Procedures are not legislative instruments (see subsection 15(8) of the Act).  \n\n2\n\n\n--- Page 4 ---\n\nPrinciples   \n2       Who may determine a breach of the Code and impose a sanction \nNote: \n\n Clause 40 of the Australian Public Service Commissioner’s Directions 2016 provides that where the \nconduct of an APS employee raises concerns that relate both to effective performance and possible \nbreaches of the Code, the Agency Head must, before making a decision to deal with a suspected \nbreach under the formal misconduct provisions (being these Procedures), have regard to any relevant \nstandards and guidance issued by the Australian Public Service Commissioner.  \n\nInvestigations of suspected misconduct by former employees can be undertaken, but sanctions cannot \nbe imposed on former employees. \n\n2.1 \n\nAs soon as practicable after a suspected breach of the Code has been identified, the \nElectoral Commissioner or the Deputy Electoral Commissioner may deal with a suspected \nbreach, in accordance with the Procedures, by: \n\na)  making a written determination whether the APS employee has breached the Code; or \n\nb)  selecting the person  to make a determination whether the APS employee has breached \n\nthe Code (the breach decision maker).  \n\nNote: \n\nThe Australian Public Service Commissioner’s prior written consent is required if a non APS \nemployee will be selected as the breach decision maker / sanction delegate (subsection 78(8) \nof the Act).  \n\nAn internal or external investigator may be appointed by the breach decision maker to \ninvestigate the alleged breach, gather evidence and present a report of factual findings, \nincluding recommendations.  \n\nThe person making the decision on the sanction must hold a delegation under the Act to do \nso (the sanction delegate). \n\nNote: These Procedures do not prevent the breach decision maker from being the sanction decision \nmaker in the same matter. \n\nSubject to clause 2.3 above, these procedures do not prevent the breach decision maker \nfrom being the sanction delegate in the same matter. \n\nThe Australian Public Service Commission publication ‘Handling Misconduct Managers Guide \n’, is a recommended resource available to the Breach Decision Maker and Sanction Delegate, \nto support them in making the determination and sanction decision.  \n\nDetermination process \nThe process for determining whether an APS employee has breached the Code must be \ncarried out with as little formality, and with as much expedition, as a proper consideration of \nthe matter allows. \n\nThe process must be consistent with the principles of procedural fairness. \n\nA formal hearing is not required in order for a person to determine whether an APS \nemployee has breached the Code. \n\nInformation to be given to employee before a determination is made \nA determination may not be made in relation to a suspected breach of the Code by an APS \nemployee unless reasonable steps have been taken to inform the employee of: \n\n2.2 \n\n2.3 \n\n2.4 \n\n2.5 \n\n3 \n3.1 \n\n3.2 \n\n3.3 \n\n4 \n4.1 \n\n3\n\n\n--- Page 5 ---\n\na)  the details of the suspected breach of the Code including any variation of those details; \n\nand \n\nb)  the sanctions that may be imposed on the employee under subsection 15(1) of the Act. \n\n4.2 \n\nA person who is making a determination in relation to a suspected breach of the Code by an \nAPS employee must give that employee a reasonable opportunity to make an oral and/or \nwritten statement, in relation to the suspected breach.  This statement may be made to the \nBreach Decision Maker or to the appointed investigator: \n\na)  within seven days of the APS employee being informed of the details (or any variation of \n\nthose details) of the suspected breach; or \n\nb)  such longer period as is allowed.  \n\n4.3 \n\n4.4 \n\n5 \n\n5.1 \n\n5.2 \n\n6 \n6.1 \n\n6.2 \n\n6.3 \n\n6.4 \n\nAn APS employee who does not make a statement in relation to the suspected breach is not, \nonly for that reason, to be taken to have admitted committing the suspected breach. \n\nThe breach decision maker or the investigator may agree to a request made by the APS \nemployee who is suspected of breaching the Code to have a support person present in a \nmeeting or interview they conduct.  The support person cannot speak or advocate on the \nemployees behalf. \n\nPersons involved in making a determination or imposing a sanction to be \nindependent and unbiased \nThe breach decision maker, any investigator assisting the breach decision maker and the \nsanction delegate must be, and must appear to be, independent and unbiased. \n\nA person must not determine whether an APS employee has breached the Code if the \nperson has previously made a report in relation to all or any matter suspected of \nconstituting the breach by the employee. \n\nSanctions \nIf a determination is made that an APS employee has breached the Code, the APS employee \nmay be subject to the imposition of a sanction under section 15 of the Act. \n\nSanctions are intended to be proportionate to the nature of the breach, and provide a clear \nmessage to the relevant employee that their behaviour was unacceptable. \n\nThe process for deciding on sanction must be consistent with the principles of procedural \nfairness. \n\nIf a determination is made that an APS employee has breached the Code, a sanction may not \nbe imposed on the employee unless reasonable steps have been taken to: \n\na) \n\ninform the APS employee of: \n\ni. \n\nii. \n\niii. \n\nthe determination that has been made; \n\nthe sanction or sanctions that are under consideration; and \n\nthe factors that are under consideration in determining any sanction to be \n\nimposed; and \n\n4\n\n\n--- Page 6 ---\n\nb)  give the APS employee a reasonable opportunity to make a written statement in relation \n\nto the sanction or sanctions under consideration within 7 calendar days, or any longer \n\nperiod that is allowed by the sanction delegate. \n\nNote:   The sanction delegate may decide to give the employee the opportunity to make both a \n\nwritten and an oral statement. \n\n7 \n7.1 \n\nRecord of determination and sanction \nIf a determination is made in relation to a suspected breach of the Code by an APS \nemployee, a written record must be made of: \n\na)  the suspected breach; and  \n\nb)  the determination; and  \n\nc)  any sanctions imposed as a result of a determination that the employee breached the \n\nCode; and \n\nd)  if a statement of reasons was given to the employee – the statement of reasons.  \n\nNote:   The Archives Act 1983 and the Privacy Act 1988 apply to a record made under this clause. \n\n8 \n8.1 \n\nProcedures where basis of engagement in the AEC changes or ends \nThis clause applies where an APS employee is suspected of having breached the Code and a \ndetermination has not been made in relation to the suspected breach before: \n\na)  the basis of the employee's engagement in the AEC changes; or \n\nb)  the employee moves to another Agency, \n\nNote:   Examples of a change in the basis of an APS employee's engagement in an Agency are as follows: \n\na)  a change from engagement for a specified term, or for the duration of a specified task, to \n\nengagement as an ongoing APS employee; \n\nb)  a change from engagement for duties that are irregular or intermittent to engagement as an \n\nongoing APS employee. \n\n8.2 \n\nIf the basis of the APS employee's engagement in the AEC has changed before a \ndetermination is made in relation to the suspected breach, the determination must be made \nin accordance with the procedures applicable to the basis of the employee's engagement in \nthe AEC at the time the process for determining whether the employee has breached the \nCode is commenced. \n\n8.3 \n\nMovements (including promotions) will not take effect until the matter is resolved, unless \nboth Agency Heads agree otherwise. \n\nNote: The matter is taken to be resolved when: \n\na)  a determination is made; or \n\nb) \n\nit is decided that a determination is not necessary. \n\nLegislation \n\n■  Archives Act 1983 (Cth), < http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Series/C2004A02796 > \n\n■  Privacy Act 1988 (Cth), < http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Series/C2004A03712 > \n\n5\n\n\n--- Page 7 ---\n\n■  Public Service Act 1999 (Cth), < http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Series/C2004A00538 > \n\n■  Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Act 2013 (Cth), \n\n< http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Series/C2013A00123 > \n\n■  Public Governance, Performance and Accountability (Consequential and Transitional \n\nProvisions) Act 2014 (Cth), < http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Series/C2014A00062 > \n\nReferences \n\n•  Australian Public Service Commission publication ‘Handling Misconduct: a human resource \n\nmanagers guide’ \n\nContact  \nPeople, Performance and Integrity team, \nCorporate Services Branch \n\n6\n\n\n--- Page 8 ---\n\nVersion Control \n\nVersion \n\nLast review date \n\nAction \n\nNext review date \n\nOwner \n\nApproved by \n\n1.0 \n\n18/08/2014 \n\nConversion to PSB \nPolicy Format \n\n19/08/2015 \n\n1.1 \n\nDecember 2016 \n\nNovember 2017 \n\n1.2 \n\n1.3 \n\nDecember 2018 \n\nReview in line with \nBranch policy review \nfor EA 16-19 and \nPSCD16 \n\nChange references \nto PSB to reflect CSB \n– Insert unchanged \npolicy to new AEC \nPolicy template \nformat \n\nReview and changes \nto clarify procedural \nrequirements and \ninclude updates \nfrom APSC \nPublications \n\nDecember 2017 \n\nNovember 2018 \n\nPerformance \nManagement, \nPSB \n\nTom Rogers, A/g \nElectoral \nCommissioner \n\nPerformance \nand Conduct \nTeam \n\nAssistant Director, \nPerformance and \nConduct Team \n\nDirector, People \nSecurity and \nIntegrity \n\nAssistant \nCommissioner – \nCorporate Services \nBranch \n\nNovember 2019 \n\nDirector People, \nSecurity and \nIntegrity \n\nFirst Assistant \nCommissioner - \nCapability \n\n7\n\n\n\n--- Page 1 ---\n\nAcknowledgement and declaration of key obligations \n\nRelevant legislation \n\n■  Archives Act 1983 \n■  Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 \n■  Crimes Act 1914 \n\n■  Public Service Act 1999 \n■  Criminal Code Act 1995 \n■  Privacy Act 1988 \n\n■  Work Health and Safety Act 2011 \n■  Public Governance, Performance \n\nand Accountability Act 2013\n\nPrivacy statement: The information collected in this document will be used for the purpose of enabling the Australian Electoral \nCommission to carry out its responsibilities as an employer under the Public Service Act 1999, its Enterprise Agreement, the Fair Work Act \n2009, and related Commonwealth employment legislation and taxation law.

The First Assistant Commissioner, Service Delivery Division is the \nNational Election Manager. \n\n1 AEC Corporate Plan 2021-22: https://www.aec.gov.au/About_AEC/Publications/corporate-plan/index.htm  \n\n Page 4 \n\nAPS1 Induction and training booklet\n\n\n--- Page 6 ---\n\nState offices \n\nState offices are located in each state capital. The Northern Territory office is in Darwin. The \nAustralian Capital Territory (ACT) is managed by the NSW State Manager except during election \nperiods, when an Australian Electoral Officer (AEO) for the ACT is appointed. \n\nDivisional offices \n\nDivisional offices are responsible for electoral administration within each electoral division, which \nincludes the conduct of elections, management of the electoral roll and carrying out public awareness \nactivities. Some divisions are located in a standalone office, while others are co-located with other \ndivisions and operate as larger work units. \n\nElectoral divisions are also known as electorates. There are 151 electoral divisions in Australia, and \neach electoral division is represented by a member of the House of Representatives.  \n\nThe AEC values and commitments \n\nThe AEC’s values of electoral integrity through quality, agility and professionalism, supported by the \norganisational commitment to the ballot paper principles and every task matters principle, were first \nintroduced in February 2015. \n\nSince then, the AEC values and commitments have been a fundamental part of the AEC; forming a \nvalues and behaviours framework that has underpinned everything the AEC does as individuals and \nas an organisation. \n\nDefining the AEC values \n\nEach value has been defined to support all staff in having a common understanding of what each \nvalue means. The definition for each value is written as a ‘We statement’ to reflect its connection to \nthe AEC’s purpose and vision: \n\nOur purpose is to maintain an impartial and independent electoral system for eligible voters \nthrough active electoral roll management, efficient delivery of polling services, and targeted \neducation and public awareness programs. \n\nOur vision – We are a leader in refining and delivering best practice in election management. \n\nThe definitions are supported by I statements that provide examples of what each value looks like in \naction (i.e. a guide of the behaviours expected of AEC staff). These statements will help staff identify \nand promote behaviours around the workplace that demonstrate Electoral \nIntegrity through Professionalism, Agility, and Quality. \n\nA spotlight on each value, can be found on the AEC values launch page on the Intranet. \n\nElectoral integrity \n\nWe provide electoral services to deliver the franchise \n\nWe are neutral, transparent, and accountable in the preparation and conduct of electoral processes \n\nWe provide voters and stakeholders with confidence in the conduct and result of an election \n\nWhat does this look like in the AEC? \n\n■ \n\n■ \n\n Page 5 \n\nI maintain political neutrality and impartiality \n\nI respect and protect the privacy of an elector’s personal information \n\nAPS1 Induction and training booklet\n\n\n--- Page 7 ---\n\n■ \n\n■ \n\n■ \n\n■ \n\n■ \n\nI uphold the integrity of the electoral roll at all times \n\nI uphold the sanctity of the ballot paper in all its forms and at all times \n\nI provide accurate information to stakeholders and work to correct any misunderstanding that \nmay occur \n\nI ensure my actions reflect positively on the reputation of the AEC \n\nI consider the integrity of electoral process in every task and how my conduct can impact the \nintegrity of the election \n\n■ \n\nI follow policies and procedures to support delivery of tasks related to elections administration \n\nQuality \n\nWe maintain the highest possible standards and continue to improve upon best practice while \nconsidering the needs of our users, stakeholders and clients \n\nWe understand that no matter how small a task is, it has the potential to impact the reputation of the \nAEC, our stakeholders, and electors \n\nWhat does this look like in the AEC? \n\n■ \n\n■ \n\n■ \n\n■ \n\n■ \n\n■ \n\nI commit to consistently achieving the highest standard of work \n\nI ensure the information and advice I provide is accurate and timely \n\nI am aware that no matter how small or insignificant a task appears to be, it has the potential \nto impact the AEC, our stakeholders, and our customers \n\nI respond positively and constructively to feedback and guidance on my performance \n\nI acknowledge that robust and transparent information management drives quality business \noutcomes \n\nI collect, use and disclose personal information in strict compliance with the Australian Privacy \nPrinciples \n\nAgility \n\nWe embrace and respond positively to the dynamic and complex environment in which we operate \n\nWe will anticipate, adapt and respond to change and welcome new ways of working. \n\nWhat does this look like in the AEC? \n\n■ \n\n■ \n\n■ \n\n■ \n\n■ \n\n■ \n\n■ \n\nI adapt and respond to change and ask for help when it is needed. \n\nI stay calm and focused when working under pressure and in difficult situations. \n\nI provide workable solutions to solve immediate problems and I identify and escalate more \ncomplex problems that may impact on my tasks \n\nI maintain an awareness of the work of other business areas and adapt to changing priorities \nas required. \n\nI share my knowledge and information with team members and staff \n\nI work collaboratively with teams on shared problems and initiatives \n\nI identify lessons to be learned or opportunities for innovation in my work \n\n Page 6 \n\nAPS1 Induction and training booklet\n\n\n--- Page 8 ---\n\nProfessionalism \n\nWe deliver our work to the highest standards, using our knowledge and skills to provide excellent \nservice in all areas of our work \n\nWe continue to develop a high performing, capable and responsive AEC workforce \n\nWe show respect and courtesy to our colleagues and to our stakeholders \n\nWhat does this look like in the AEC? \n\n■ \n\n■ \n\n■ \n\n■ \n\n■ \n\n■ \n\n■ \n\nI conduct myself in a cordial and respectful manner with colleagues, customers and \nstakeholders at all times. \n\nI respond and anticipate client needs in a timely, professional and helpful matter. \n\nI keep up to date with information and new processes relevant to my role. I act honestly and \nethically and encourage others to do the same. \n\nI seek opportunities to develop and learn, taking responsibility for my own personal \ndevelopment \n\nI respectfully challenge behaviour that is inconsistent with organisational values, standards of \nthe APS Code of Conduct. \n\nI recognise and value the contribution of others. \n\nI follow through reliably and take personal responsibility for my actions and decisions and their \nconsequences. \n\n■ \n\nI take pride in doing my job well \n\nEvery task matters \n\nWe have a mantra at the AEC that ‘every task matters’, so it is expected that all staff conduct AEC \nbusiness in a professional manner - regardless of the task, no matter how big or how small. It is \ncritical that staff follow all AEC procedures at all times; delivering high quality electoral events that \nare transparent and uphold the AEC’s reputation as a leading electoral management body.  \n\nBallot paper principles \n\nThe AEC upholds the sanctity of the ballot paper in all its forms and at all times. This is given effect \nthrough two principles: \n\n■  All ballot papers remain ‘live’ from printing through to statutorily authorised destruction. \n\n■  The security, integrity and accountability of ballot papers must be preserved at all times – \n\nincluding transit and storage by the AEC, contractors, or other third parties. \n\nThese principles underpin all AEC planning, training, systems, handling and practices associated \nwith ballot papers. They show how important ballot paper security is and provides a basis for the \ntreatment of every ballot paper from printing to destruction by anyone who handles ballot papers, \nincluding but not limited to staff, polling officials and contractors.  \n\nVisual representation of the values and commitments \n\nThe values and commitments are captured in one visual representation (see below) to frame and \nguide how we work and underpin everything we do. This is displayed in all AEC offices and should \nact as a daily reminder of the importance of modelling these core values. It is important to continually \ntalk about the values and commitments and how they apply to you as an individual and as an \norganisation.  \n\n Page 7 \n\nAPS1 Induction and training booklet\n\n\n--- Page 9 ---\n\nPage 8 \n\nAPS1 Induction and training booklet\n\n\n--- Page 10 ---\n\nAustralian Public Service (APS) Values and Code of Conduct \n\nThe AEC is committed to providing a respectful workplace that supports a positive work environment, \nfree from inappropriate behaviour.  \n\nThe APS values set out the parliament’s expectations, behaviours and performance standards of \nstaff working in the APS. You must at all times ensure your behaviours meet these standards which \ncan be remembered by the acronym ICARE. \n\nThe APS values \n\nImpartial \n\nThe APS is apolitical and provides the government with advice that is frank, honest, \ntimely and based on the best available evidence. \n\nCommitted to service \n\nThe APS is professional, objective, innovative and efficient, and works collaboratively \nto achieve the best results for the Australian community and the government. \n\nAccountable  \n\nThe APS is open and accountable to the Australian community under the law and \nwithin the framework of ministerial responsibility. \n\nRespectful  \n\nThe APS respects all people, including their rights and their heritage. \n\nEthical \n\nThe APS demonstrates leadership, is trustworthy, and acts with integrity, in all that it \ndoes. \n\nThe APS Code of Conduct is set out in s13 of the Public Service Act 1999 and lists the expected \nbehaviours and actions required of all staff working in the APS. This is not about how well you do \nyour job, but how you behave when undertaking your role. \n\nA breach of the Code of Conduct can result in sanctions, ranging from a reprimand to termination of \nemployment. \n\nThe Code of Conduct can be found on the following page. A brochure with more information is \navailable on the APSC website: https://www.apsc.gov.au/publication/aps-values-and-code-conduct-\npractice  \n\n Page 9 \n\nAPS1 Induction and training booklet\n\n\n--- Page 11 ---\n\nThe Code of Conduct \n\nThe Code of Conduct requires that an APS employee must: \n\n  behave honestly and with integrity in connection with APS employment; \n\n  act with care and diligence in connection with APS employment; \n\n  when acting in connection with APS employment, treat everyone with respect \n\nand courtesy, and without harassment; \n\n  when acting in connection with APS employment, comply with all applicable \n\nAustralian laws; \n\n  comply with any lawful and reasonable direction given by someone in the \n\nemployee's Agency who has authority to give the direction; \n\n  maintain appropriate confidentiality about dealings that the employee has with \n\nany Minister or Minister's member of staff; \n\n \n\ntake reasonable steps to avoid any conflict of interest (real or apparent) and \ndisclose details of any material personal interest of the employee in \nconnection with the employee's APS employment; \n\n  use Commonwealth resources in a proper manner and for a proper purpose; \n\n  not provide false or misleading information in response to a request for \ninformation that is made for official purposes in connection with the \nemployee's APS employment; \n\n  not improperly use inside information or the employee's duties, status, power \n\nor authority: \n\n1.  to gain, or seek to gain, a benefit or an advantage for the employee or \n\nany other person; or \n\n2.  to cause, or to seek to cause, detriment to the employee's Agency, the \n\nCommonwealth or any other person.  \n\n  at all times behave in a way that upholds the APS Values and Employment \nPrinciples, and the integrity and good reputation of the employee's Agency \nand the APS; \n\n  while on duty overseas, at all times behave in a way that upholds the good \n\nreputation of Australia; and \n\n  comply with any other conduct requirement that is prescribed by the \n\nregulations (regulations available on the ComLaw website). \n\nThe Code of Conduct is set out in section 13 of the Public Service Act 1999. \n\n Page 10 \n\nAPS1 Induction and training booklet\n\n\n--- Page 12 ---\n\nAPS1 Administration Assistant \n\nAbout your role \n\nAn APS1 Administration Assistant is a casual staff member, usually located in a divisional, state or \nterritory office or at an out-posted centre. Your primary role is to provide administrative and \nprocessing support to the office during peak workload periods. You have been employed to provide \nadministrative support to your office in the lead up to, and during, the next federal election. The work \nyou will be doing is vitally important to the delivery of a successful election, and we will train and \nsupport you to do your tasks well. \n\nWe aim to give you as much notice as we can, but during the election you may be asked to stay at \nwork to complete a task at short notice. You should also expect to work a number of weekends \nduring the election period. \n\nDuties \n\nYour duties will include: \n\n■  handling counter and telephone enquiries \n\n■  checking and responding to emails \n\n■  preparing routine correspondence using automated systems \n\n■  performing photocopying, scanning, collating and mailing documents \n\n■  processing enrolment forms from clients applying to enrol or updating their \n\nexisting enrolment details \n\n■  helping to maintain the address register \n\n■  handling postal vote applications and returned postal vote certificates (during an \n\nelection) \n\n■  processing declaration vote envelopes to determine if the voter is able to have \n\ntheir vote counted (during an election) \n\n■  other tasks and projects as directed. \n\nPerformance plan \n\nIt is a requirement for all Australian Government employees (ongoing and non-ongoing) to have an \nindividual performance plan (IPP). An IPP is linked to organisational and business goals and \nmaintains the APS and AEC values. It also provides employees with a clear statement of \nperformance expectations. \n\nYour manager will meet with you to put your IPP in place and will advise if it will be done through the \nAurion Employee Self Service (ESS) facility or the IPP agreement and review paper form. \n\nAgile pool \n\nYou may be working in an agile pool of staff. This means that for certain tasks or projects you work \non, you may be required to report to someone other than your line manager. Your line manager will \nremain your point of contact for your timesheets, individual performance plan and any other matters. \n\n Page 11 \n\nAPS1 Induction and training booklet\n\n\n--- Page 13 ---\n\nTraining \n\nThe AEC’s approach to learning is based on the 70:20:10 model. This is an approach where: \n\n■  70 per cent of learning is from experience – typically on the job experience and practice. \nStaff have access to self-directed learning tools, such as videos, asking the community, \nsimulations, blogs, job aids and knowledge management systems. Staff benefit from short \nterm secondments, job rotations and projects. \n\n■  20 per cent of learning is from others - both formal and informal coaching and mentoring \nfrom others, including participation in expert networks, forums and communities of practice. \n\n■  10 per cent of learning is structured - formal learning interventions and structured programs \n\nthat can involve assessment, accreditation and a mix of classroom and eLearning. \n\nMandatory eLearning courses  \n\nA list of all mandatory eLearning courses that are required to be completed within the first four weeks \nof commencing duties with the AEC is located at Attachment A. These eLearning courses can be \naccessed and completed via AEC Learning.  \n\nOther training resources \n\nThere are also a number of optional training resources listed in Attachment A that provide context \naround various election activities. These courses should be completed at the discretion of your \nsupervisor.  \n\nYour supervisor will work closely with you as you begin to work on real enrolment forms and check \nyour work to ensure they are satisfied with your learning. Where necessary, or if you request it, \naspects of the training can be covered again until you are managing your work confidently and with \nsuccess. \n\nWe undertake quality assurance processes, such as the Enrolment Quality Assurance Program \n(EQAP) to identify any enrolment processing errors. This will also help inform your learning progress, \nand we will discuss with you any errors or issues identified through the program. \n\n Page 12 \n\nAPS1 Induction and training booklet\n\n\n--- Page 14 ---\n\nUseful information \n\nTimesheets \n\nThe Aurion Employee Self Service (ESS) facility is the system used to submit your timesheets. You \ncan consult the Aurion ESS intranet page for user guides, forms and FAQs. Your supervisor will \nadvise if you are required to use Aurion ESS to manage your timesheets. \n\nWorkplace health and safety \n\nThe AEC strives to maintain a workplace environment that demonstrably values health, safety and \nwellbeing. \n\nYour supervisor will ensure you take regular breaks, and you must take a break after five consecutive \nhours of duty. If you feel you are not being given sufficient breaks, raise this with your supervisor. \n\nAEC employees are also required to take reasonable care for their own health and safety and to \nensure their own acts or omissions do not adversely affect others. You are required to follow \nreasonable instructions given by the AEC, and all AEC policies and procedures on Workplace Health \nand Safety.  \n\nVisit the Health, Safety and Wellbeing page on the intranet for more information. \n\nFatigue management \n\nFatigue is a state of mental and/or physical exhaustion which reduces a person's ability to perform \ntasks safely and effectively. \n\nThe AEC aims to create a safe and healthy work environment for all its workers, and prevent, as far \nas is reasonably practicable, fatigue affecting its workers. Fatigue is an ever-present risk in the AEC, \nin particular during election periods, and can't always be prevented, but must always be managed.  \n\nImproving the way the AEC manages fatigue can significantly improve the performance of workers \nand teams. This improvement leads to a reduction in errors, improved workplace efficiency and the \nelimination of, or the minimisation of, health and safety risks to workers. The risks of workers \nexperiencing fatigue arise from a range of sources and for a variety of reasons and can be different \nfor each individual worker. Fatigue can be caused by work related factors, factors outside work \nand/or a combination of both and may accumulate over time.  \n\nYour supervisor will discuss fatigue management with you, and the policies and support guides \navailable. Visit the Fatigue management and prevention page on the intranet for more information. \n\nSecurity \n\nSecurity passes \n\nYou will be issued with a security pass and you must wear it at all times while you are in an AEC \noffice. You must take off your pass when outside the office. \n\n Page 13 \n\nAPS1 Induction and training booklet\n\n\n--- Page 15 ---\n\nSystems and information security \n\nWhen you start, you will be given an AEC email address and access to the AEC’s intranet. You must \nfollow AEC policies when using these systems, and relevant information is provided for you later in \nthis booklet. \n\nAs most of your work is systems based, you will also be given an individual login and password for \neach system you use. You are personally responsible for securing your login and password details, \nand for all activity on the systems undertaken using your login. The AEC actively monitors computer \nand systems usage. \n\nMisuse of our systems, unlawful access to the records of our clients or unlawful disclosure of \ninformation is taken very seriously by the AEC, and there are significant consequences for any \nbreach, including the possibility of legal proceedings. \n\nPrivate use of IT systems and social media \n\nYou are allowed to use the AEC’s computer network for private purposes, as long as it's reasonable \n(for example, internet banking). You are not permitted to access or download illicit data or \ninformation, such as pornography, hacking, peer-to-peer networking or pirated software. \n\nThe AEC has important requirements that must be adhered to when it comes to the personal use of \nsocial media. You should consider the impact of your activities on the reputation of the AEC before \nyou make a comment or produce any content on social media. Your actions online must not conflict \nwith the AEC’s political impartiality requirement and should not compromise public confidence in the \nagency or the APS. \n\nPersonal security \n\nEvery AEC office has an emergency warden and some offices also have a first aid officer. Your \ninduction to your local office will include information on evacuation procedures and an introduction to \nthese officers. \n\nVisitors to AEC offices who are accessing parts of the office that are not designated reception areas \nwill need to sign in, wear a visitor pass and be escorted at all times. If you notice a person in your \noffice who is not wearing a visitor pass or is not being escorted, please alert your supervisor who will \ndeal with the situation immediately. \n\nTelephone directories \n\nUp-to-date telephone directories for both divisional office staff and state office staff are available on \nthe intranet and on the local state collaboration sites. Your supervisor will show you how to navigate \nthese sites and access the telephone directories for your locality. \n\nYou can also find details about individual officers on the intranet by using the ‘Search People’ facility \nin the top-right search bar, or by searching their name in Microsoft Teams. \n\nMulti-function devices and printers \n\nThe AEC uses multi-function devices (MFDs), which provide staff with the ability to copy and print \ndocuments, and to scan and send documents to an email inbox. Unless your supervisor tells you \notherwise, all of your printing must be in black and white. You will be provided with an access card to \nlog you in to the MFD – this may be your building access card or a separate MFD card. \n\n Page 14 \n\nAPS1 Induction and training booklet\n\n\n--- Page 16 ---\n\nWhen printing, be conscious of paper usage, but also of the currency of the document into the future. \nDocuments like Quick Reference Guides often go out of date quickly when printed. \n\nMore information and assistance on connecting to a printer can be accessed in the AEC Service \nCentre's Knowledge Hub, through searching 'printer'. \n\nMicrosoft teams (AEC Teams) \n\nMicrosoft Teams is a communication platform where you can call, chat, meet and collaborate with \nAEC colleagues. The AEC has its own hosted implementation of Microsoft Teams, called AEC \nTEAMS. \n\nYou should use AEC TEAMS for all your collaboration needs, such as chat with colleagues, meetings \nand also live events. You have AEC TEAMS installed on your desktop ready to use. \n\nMore information and assistance on using AEC Teams can be accessed in the AEC Service Centre's \nKnowledge Hub, through searching 'Teams'. \n\n Page 15 \n\nAPS1 Induction and training booklet\n\n\n--- Page 17 ---\n\nPrivacy and security \n\nAs a government authority handling personal information, the AEC has very strict rules about privacy \nand security. Many of us have access to electors’ personal information, including some information \nthat is highly sensitive, and we must take care at all times to uphold our responsibilities. AEC staff \nmembers also have limited access to records of clients of other government agencies, and \noccasionally medical information about an individual client. \n\nLegislation \n\nWhen handling personal information AEC staff must comply with the Australian Privacy Principles \n(APPs) under the Privacy Act 1988. The purpose of the Privacy Act is to protect the privacy of \nindividuals, and to protect personal information that is collected by entities such as the AEC. \n\nAs an AEC employee accessing personal information, you are also bound by the requirements of the \nthe Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918, the Code of Conduct set out in the Public Service Act 1999 \nand the Crimes Act 1914. Unlawful access, use or disclosure of elector information by an AEC staff \nmember is a breach of the Code of Conduct and, in some cases, is also a criminal offence. \n\nThe AEC publishes the following disclosure on our website: \n\nUnder the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918, the electoral roll (containing \nnames and addresses) may be supplied to prescribed authorities, members of \nparliament, political parties, approved medical researchers, public health \nprograms and electoral researchers. It is also used to maintain joint \nCommonwealth and state and territory electoral rolls. \n\nThis disclosure is therefore authorised by law. Only authorised delegates are permitted to provide \nthat information. \n\nMishandling of personal information \n\nPreserving the security of personal information is not only about ensuring compliance with the \nrequirements of the Privacy Act 1988. The Australian Privacy Principles (APPs) outline how the AEC \nmust handle, use and manage personal information. If we mishandle the personal information of our \nclients, it can cause them damage and, in turn, it can also lead to a loss of trust and considerable \nharm to our reputation. \n\nThe community expects that their sensitive information will be given a higher level of protection than \nnon-sensitive information. This expectation is reflected in the increased privacy protections that \napply. Sensitive information could include the risk to a client’s personal safety or that of their family, a \nclient’s movements overseas for work purposes (for example, for defence personnel), a client’s \ncriminal sentence or health information that identifies an individual’s medical condition. \n\nThe mishandling of sensitive information may: \n\n■  provide the basis for discrimination or other more severe types of harm \n\n■ \n\n■ \n\n Page 16 \n\nlead to humiliation or embarrassment, or undermine an individual’s dignity \n\nimpact negatively on the AEC’s reputation. \n\nAPS1 Induction and training booklet\n\n\n--- Page 18 ---\n\nYour responsibilities \n\nWhile employed by the AEC you must abide by all AEC privacy and security principles. You should \nalso report to your supervisor if you see a colleague doing anything that is a breach of the rules or is \nnot appropriate. \n\n■  You must never use AEC systems to access any enrolment record beyond the ones you need \nto process as part of your work. For example, you must never look up a friend or colleague’s \naddress, birth date or telephone number. \n\n■  You must never leave your computer unlocked while you are away from your workstation, \n\nregardless of how long you are away, unless you can see your workstation for the entire time. \n\n■  You must lock away hardcopy enrolment records as per local filing protocols, including clients’ \nmedical information, if you are away from your workstation for longer than 30 minutes and \novernight. \n\n■  You must never record the specifics of a client’s medical condition (for example, ‘dementia’, \n\n‘schizophrenia’) in RMANS or GENESIS. \n\n■  You will need to use information from other government agencies (such as driver’s license \n\ndetails) so check with your supervisor about the correct use of the information. \n\n■  When talking to a client or other member of the public, you must never disclose information \nfrom their record unless you have confirmed you are talking to that individual. To confirm, \nensure the person gives you identifying information; never offer it to them. \n\n■ \n\nIndividuals who want the AEC to provide details of their enrolment record in writing must \nmake the request in writing themselves, and the AEC will respond in writing. The response \nwill only be given to the individual client. You won’t be required to do this but you may be \ncalled upon to give advice to clients on this matter. \n\n■  Regardless of a person’s official credentials (such as a police officer or lawyer), you must \nnever provide information or copies of an enrolment record, whatever the status of that \nenrolment. Log all such requests in the Public Engagement Contact Tool and refer them to \nyour supervisor. Ensure you upload any relevant documents into the Tool. \n\n■ \n\nIf you become aware that a staff member is mishandling personal information, for example, \naccessing personal information for any purpose outside of official AEC duties, you should \nreport the matter to a senior officer as soon as you can. \n\nMore information is available on the Privacy page on the intranet.  \n\nProtecting privacy – we all play a key role \n\nPrivacy, and the proper management of personal information and data, is a critical responsibility for \nthe AEC and its staff. \n\nEvery day AEC staff handle the personal information of electors and staff with a high degree of care \nand accuracy. It is a fact though that, on occasion, mistakes occur due to human error. Any human \nerror in the management of personal information can have a real human effect on those who entrust \nus with their information. \n\nTake the time to read the Quick reference guide on Privacy in Practice to help protect privacy and \nsecure personal information. \n\n Page 17 \n\nAPS1 Induction and training booklet\n\n\n--- Page 19 ---\n\nPublic enquiries  \n\nWhen interacting with the public, AEC staff are required to follow these guidelines so we can provide \nconsistent and professional client service. \n\nQuality client service \n\nThe aim of the AEC’s public enquiry management is to fulfil our obligations under the AEC Service \nCharter. The Charter is a public-facing corporate document, informing the public of what to expect \nwhen interacting with the AEC and listing the reciprocated behaviours expected of the public by the \nAEC. \n\nThe AEC asks staff to: \n\n■ \n\ntake a positive helpful approach \n\n■  maintain sound and up-to-date knowledge of electoral processes \n\n■  consider how the client feels \n\n■  consider the individual circumstances of the client \n\n■ \n\nresolve enquiries in a timely manner. \n\nService level standards \n\nThe AEC is committed to providing timely responses, which means resolving enquiries at first point of \ncontact whenever possible. If an enquiry needs further investigation, staff should ensure the relevant \nservice level standards are met.  \n\nThe enquiry service level standards for our public contact channels are: \n\nPhone \n\nanswered within 90 seconds \n\nWalk-in \n\nacknowledged within five minutes \n\nEmail, post \n\nresponded to within five working days \n\nFurther information about the AEC’s service level standards can be found on the Public engagement \nand complaints management intranet page. \n\nResolving straightforward enquiries at first point of contact \n\nWhere possible, enquiries should be handled at the first point of contact by the person who initially \nreceived it and often at the same time it is received. \n\nYou should attempt to resolve an enquiry when you receive it by: \n\n■ \n\n■ \n\nlistening to the enquirer and acknowledging their concerns \n\nidentifying the issue(s) \n\n■  clarifying anything that is unclear \n\n Page 18 \n\nAPS1 Induction and training booklet\n\n\n--- Page 20 ---\n\n■  considering individual circumstances \n\n■  keeping it simple by limiting your use of jargon and acronyms \n\n■ \n\ntaking personal responsibility for resolving the enquiry. \n\nWhere appropriate, you should advise enquirers about the services available through our website: \nwww.aec.gov.au.These services include checking their enrolment, updating their details or enrolling \nfor the first time. \n\nYou must record the details of the enquiry in the Public Engagement Contact Tool, including the \nresponse provided, and mark it as ‘resolved’. You must also attach a copy of any related \ncorrespondence.  \n\nHandling more complex enquiries \n\nComplex enquiries, or those for which the information is not reasonably able to be found, must be \nreferred to your supervisor. \n\nEnquiries from political parties, candidates and potential candidates must be referred to the Divisional \nReturning Officer as soon as possible. Record the details of the enquiry in the Public Engagement \nContact Tool, and escalate it through the tool, attaching copies of related correspondence. \n\nComplaints \n\nAll complaints are to be logged in the Public Engagement Contact Tool. \n\nYour supervisor will brief you on which complaints you can handle directly and which you should refer \nto a more senior staff member. \n\nComplaints should be acknowledged within three business days unless the matter can be resolved \nwithin three business days. If the matter needs to be referred for further advice, this must occur within \none business day to allow maximum time for the matter to be resolved by the receiving officer. \n\nComplaints are to be resolved within 10 business days. A quick guide to complaints management \nprovides further guidance on this process.  \n\nAEC email protocol \n\nEmails are the main way we send important information to each other in the AEC or request action. \nIn the course of your work, you may need to send emails to work colleagues or send responses to \nemail enquiries from members of the public, so you will need to follow these guidelines. \n\nSetting up your email signature \n\nThe AEC’s email system is accessed via Microsoft Outlook on your computer’s desktop. Before you \nuse the email system you need to set up your email signature. This is the block of text that will \nappear at the bottom of every email you send.

More information and assistance on updating your email \nsignature can be accessed in the AEC Service Centre's Knowledge Hub, through searching \n'signature'. \n\n Page 19 \n\nAPS1 Induction and training booklet\n\n\n--- Page 21 ---\n\nDrafting an internal email \n\n■ \n\n■ \n\n■ \n\nIn the TO field: address the email to those AEC officers who need the information or who \nneed to act. \n\nIn the CC field: copy the email to other AEC staff who may need to be kept informed of the \nemail request or the information being conveyed. This will usually include the relevant \nmanager(s) of the primary addressees, and your own supervisor, and other AEC staff who \nhave a need to know. If you are unsure, clarify this with your supervisor. \n\nIn the SUBJECT field: at the beginning, indicate in capital letters whether the message is \nFOR INFORMATION or FOR ACTION. Clearly state the subject. If action is required, include \na due date. \n\nWhen composing the main part of the email in the Content space, keep in mind these guidelines: \n\n■  Remember that all emails sent at work are documents that may be retrieved and possibly \n\ndisclosed under Freedom of Information legislation (even when an email has been deleted). \n\n■  The content of emails should always be drafted in a polite, business-like and factual manner. \n\n■  Ensure your email contains your official AEC signature block (see above for the directions to \n\nset this up). \n\nEmails responding to enquiries by members of the public \n\nIf you need to send emails in response to public enquiries, check with your supervisor about how to \naccess standard responses to common requests on the AEC intranet and set them up using the \nQuick Steps facility in Outlook. \n\nBefore sending an email \n\n■  Mark it with the appropriate security classification. Emails you send will either be marked as \n\n‘OFFICIAL’ or ‘UNOFFICIAL’. Check with your supervisor for the correct classification to use. \n\n■  Check that the recipients are correct and that if sending to multiple recipients the BCC field \n\nhas been used to protect their privacy. \n\n■  Ensure any attachments are correct for the intended recipient to avoid revealing personal \n\ninformation to the wrong person. \n\n■  Reflect on the clarity, tone and content of your message, bearing in mind all emails are \n\n Page 20 \n\nAPS1 Induction and training booklet\n\n\n--- Page 22 ---\n\npotentially disclosable in response to Freedom of Information requests. \n\n■  For further tips on writing, refer to the AEC’s style guide - AEC writing style. \n\nRecordkeeping requirements after sending \n\nIf you are the person writing an original email (and not just replying to someone), your business area \nis most likely the ‘owner’ of the business activity or project that the email is about and it may need to \nbe filed in the AEC’s electronic records management system, Objective IM. Check with your \nsupervisor about whether any email correspondence you send needs to be uploaded to Objective IM. \n\nIf you are required to use ObjectiveIM you will first need to complete the Information management \nand recordkeeping eLearning course prior to accessing ObjectiveIM. You can self-enrol in this \neLearning course in AEC Learning.  \n\nThe Information and Knowledge Management (IKM) section provides instructor-led Objective training \nvia MS Teams for all new staff at the AEC. To register to attend a session search for ‘ObjectiveIM’ in \nAEC Learning. For best results learners are encouraged to attend the training as soon as possible \nafter completing the Information management and recordkeeping eLearning course. By the end of \nthe training, you will be able to do the following within Objective: \n\n■  understand the AEC file structure \n\n■  upload and edit documents \n\n■  search for records \n\n■  upload emails \n\n■  send and access Objective link/reference \n\n■ \n\nrename files and edit/view metadata. \n\nEmail etiquette \n\nUsed properly, email can assist in maintaining good working relationships, increase productivity and \nprovide efficiencies. Please follow this list of tips in your electronic communications: \n\n■  Communicate in clear, professional language. If in doubt, it is better to be overly formal rather \n\nthan unprofessional. \n\n■  Do not send anything you would not be comfortable showing to your colleagues or being seen \n\npublicly. Consider that email is more like a postcard than a sealed envelope with a letter in it. \n\n■  Treat email like any other business communication; pay attention to spelling and grammar. \n\nRun the spell check if need be. \n\n■  Re-read and check what you have written before you send it. \n\n■  Be concise and tactful. \n\n■  Break up the text by using short lines and paragraphs; this makes it easier to read. \n\n■  Do not write in UPPERCASE or bold, which may be perceived as shouting or telling off the \n\nrecipient. \n\n■  Copyright laws apply to electronic mail as well as printed media. \n\n■  Respond promptly to email messages – even if it is just to let the sender know that you will \n\nreply in full later. \n\nRemember that all laws that apply to discrimination, defamation and harassment (verbal, emotional \nand sexual) also apply to electronic communication. \n\n Page 21 \n\nAPS1 Induction and training booklet\n\n\n--- Page 23 ---\n\nAttachment A –Training for APS1 staff \n\nMandatory eLearning courses \nAPS1 staff will be automatically enrolled in the below mandatory eLearning courses via AEC \nLearning and must complete them within four weeks of commencing duties.  \n\nCategory \n\nCourse name \n\nDuration \n\nWhere to find it \n\nMandatory learning \nprogram \n\nWork, Health and Safety \nProtective Security Awareness \nFraud Awareness \nPrivacy Awareness \nIT Security \nET201 Ballot Paper Handling \nCultural Appreciation \nCOVID-19 \n\n30 min \n\n30 min \n\n30 min \n\n30 min \n\n30 min \n\n30 min \n\n30 min \n\n30 min \n\nAEC Learning \n\nManager-directed self-enrolment \nSupervisors should work with APS1 staff to identify additional eLearning courses relevant to their \nduties.

The program is designed to set \nclear expectations regarding the roles and responsibilities of Participants and the agency, and it will \nguide the performance and professional development of all staff, laying the foundations of the AEC’s \nworking environment, agency values and agency expectations. \n\nLearning outcomes \n\nBy the end of the program Participants will be able to: \n\n1.  Behave in accordance with the AEC values and commitments, and describe why they \n\nunderpin the work of the AEC. \n\n2.  Make decisions and demonstrate behaviours that represent the APS values and comply with \n\nthe APS Code of Conduct. \n\n3.  Promote and contribute to a positive organisational culture based on quality, agility and \n\nprofessionalism. \n\n4.  Apply learning to role that is compliant with policies, procedures and legislation relevant to the \n\nAEC. \n\n5.  Recognise the importance of transparency in the AEC and its impact on reputation and public \n\nperception. \n\n6.  Identify how their role contributes to AEC business outcomes and agency objectives. \n7.  Identify the internal and external factors of the AEC’s environment and consider them when \n\nperforming their role. \n\n8.  Explain the role of Parliament, the role the AEC plays in its formation and the importance of \n\npolitical neutrality. \n\n9.  Explain the guiding principles of electoral management and the three levels of government in \n\nAustralia.\n\n\n--- Page 2 ---\n\nProgram Design \n\nThe program is split across three (3) phases with modules and resources provided to support each \nphase. The program is designed to be delivered to a Participant over a period of five months and will \ncommence from two weeks prior to starting their role. \n\nPhase \n\nTiming \n\nOutcome \n\nPhase 1 – Pre-commencement \n\nModule 1 \n\nFrom 2 weeks prior to \ncommencement \n\nPhase 2 – Development \n\nDay 1 – 5 months \n\nModules 2 – 8 \n\nModules 10a or 10b \n\nPhase 3 – Follow up \n\nDay 1 – 5 months \n\nModules 2 – 8 \n\nModules 10a or 10b  \n\nReview \n\nModule 9 \n\n6 months \n\nThe Participant will have actioned all \nnecessary recruitment activities and have an \nunderstanding of the agency’s role and \nexpectations of staff and self. \n\nThe Line Manager has completed required \nactivities to ensure smooth transition on Day \none.  \n\nThe Participant and identified key staff \ninvolved in program delivery have successfully \nunderstood and participated in assigned \ninduction modules, including on the job \ntraining, and are confident that future activities \nwill be actioned in accordance with the AEC \nvalues and expectations. \n\nThe Participant and the Line Manager have \nhad meaningful discussion at all ‘Check-in \nPoints’ throughout the program. \n\nThe Line Manager and Executive Level Officer \nare confident that the programs overall \nlearning outcomes have been met. \n\nObservation of learning in action continues. \nFeedback has been provided to the NTEU for \nfurther program development and updates.  \n\nParticipation \n\nThe Participant group for the program will be staff that gain an ongoing or non-ongoing role within the \nAEC at the following levels: \n\n  APS2-APS6 \n\n  Executive Level (EL) \n\n  Senior Executive Services (SES) \n\nWhere AEC staff gain promotion, they will not be required to participate in the full program, but \nshould review the modules in consultation with their manager, and undertake identified compulsory \nactivities e.g. the AEC Foundation Programs. \n\nFor staff who gain a non-ongoing role within the AEC, they will be required to participate in the \nprogram up until the point in which their contract expires. If a staff member leaves the AEC at the \nconclusion of their contract and then returns within a six month period, they will be expected to \ncontinue working through the program until it is completed.\n\n\n--- Page 3 ---\n\nThe Program will require the identification of the following staff to support program delivery: \n\n  Line Manager - the responsible officer that will conduct the induction locally and either \n\nundertake or delegate induction activities. The Line Manager will also be responsible for \nproviding feedback on performance. \n\n  Local Induction Adviser - will help the Participant settle in and act as their primary contact on \n\ngeneral enquiries and day to day operational issues. \n\n  Executive Level Officer – through consultation with the Line Manager, they will ensure that \nexpectations of the program are being met, that mandatory training is being completed and \nthat the Participant is fit for the organisation prior to the probation period end date (where \napplicable). \n\n  Local Trainers - taken from the AEC’s assessed trainer pool, they may be responsible for \n\ndelivery of face to face session content for Participants in their office/state/branch or in other \nlocations, where required. \n\n  NTEU – will deliver face to face sessions to Participants in Canberra, including any relevant \n\ndelivery to National Office branches.  \n\nRoles and responsibilities for identified staff are clearly outlined in the resources developed for the \nprogram. \n\nCurriculum \n\nThe program is designed to provide the Participant with consistent guidance and an understanding of \nthe agency’s values, expected behaviours, corporate and operating environment, agency direction \nand purpose. \n\nSpecific information on the Participant’s job role, will be driven by their level and area of the \norganisation, and is accounted for under a capability framework and specific job role requirements. \nThese critical infrastructure pieces are being developed in parallel to the induction program. \n\nA set curriculum has been developed for the program outlining subject matter and staff involvement. \nThe curriculum provides visibility to all staff involved in the program about what will be discussed \nthroughout the five months. \n\nThe program aligns with other AEC timeframes and requirements including the development of \nIndividual Performance Plans (IPPs), probationary reporting and the completion of mandatory \ntraining. The program will direct the Participant and the Line Manager to the existing resources \navailable in these areas. \n\nThe curriculum features a two day AEC Foundation Program – National Experience in Canberra for \nthose staff at the APS6 – SES level and a one day Network Experience conducted in the states for \nthose staff at the APS2 – APS5 level. These programs are designed to support the Participant in \nmeeting the learning outcomes and provide an opportunity for the Participant to build their peer \nnetworks. Programs will be conducted twice annually with some travel required for identified staff. \n\nNOTE: As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the inaugural programs will be delivered as a virtual \nfacilitator led experience. The AEC Foundation Program – National Experience will be held virtually \nover a two week period, and the Network Experience will be held virtually over a one week period. \nOnce COVID-19 restrictions are eased, the AEC will review the Foundation Programs. \n\nSee Attachment A for an overview of the program curriculum. \n\nResources \n\nA series of induction modules have been developed by the NTEU to ensure that delivery of the \nprogram is nationally consistent, professional and in line with the curriculum and learning outcomes.\n\n\n--- Page 4 ---\n\nModules are available to identified staff through a dedicated National Induction Program SharePoint \npage located on the Learning Hub. Through the Learning Hub staff will be able to access the \nfollowing materials: \n\n  Manager Guides - each module will feature a Manager Guide that will provide the Line \n\nManager and the Local Induction Adviser with information and resources to support topics \nbeing discussed and undertaken at that time. \n\n  Checklists – each module will have a Checklist that will work in conjunction with the Manager \n\nGuide to ensure that Line Managers, the Local Induction Adviser and the Participant \nundertake their required actions. \n\n  Participant Guides – identified modules will feature a Participant Guide that will provide the \n\nParticipant with additional reading and required actions to support their learning. \n\n  Resources – each module will have assigned resources including scenarios, case studies, \ntemplates and activities to support the delivery of the program and ensure consistency. \n\n \n\n \n\nInduction eLearning course – an induction eLearning course has been developed allowing the \nParticipant to gain an initial understanding of the AEC’s working environment, including the \nAEC values and expectations. \n\nInduction videos – a series of short videos have been recorded by members of the Executive \nLeadership Team introducing themselves, welcoming the Participant to the agency and \npromoting specific key information e.g. the AEC Corporate Plan, strategic direction and their \nexpectations of staff. \n\nAdditional program resources including staff roles and responsibilities have been developed, as well \nas facilitator guides and facilitator resources for the AEC Foundation Program – National and \nNetwork Experience. \n\nConsultation \n\nThe NTEU reviewed current AEC content against the program objectives, identifying gaps in \nresources and engaging with business owners in content development. The NTEU designed and \ndeveloped materials to support the program, and business owners were consulted and reviewed all \nmodule content and eLearning as required. \n\nThe Learning and Development Community of Practice supported the program through testing, which \nensured the program was fit for purpose and user friendly. \n\nFeedback has been discussed throughout the consultation phase and changes have been made to \nthe program as required. \n\nAll identified staff who participate in the program are required to provide feedback and undertake an \nevaluation of the program upon completion of each module.\n\n\n\n--- Page 1 ---\n\nCurriculum Outline \n\nPhase \n\nModule \n\nSession Content \n\n1 \n\nModule 1 \n\n■  Activities requiring action prior to Participant commencement: \n\nPre-commencement \n\n–  On-boarding confirmation \n\n–  System access \n\n–  AEC security passes/access \n\n–  Workstation set up \n\n–  Participant check-in \n\n–  Participant to review the videos of the AEC’s Executive Leadership Team.

The AEC switchboard is the \nresponsibility of the Parliamentary and Party Registration section in NO. \n\n■  13 23 26 – This is the generic telephone number for the AEC’s divisional offices and is \n\nused on all public advertising and listings. Most calls to this phone number will be diverted \nto a divisional office after the caller enters their postcode. Where a caller does not enter a \npostcode, the call is diverted to their state office. All calls to this number from within \nAustralia are the cost of a local call. Overseas callers cannot dial this number. \n\n■  +61 2 6160 2600 – This number is advertised on our website specifically for people who \nare calling from overseas. This directs people to enter the postcode for their enrolled \naddress. Their call is then diverted to the relevant divisional office, based on the postcode \nthey enter. If no postcode is entered, the call is diverted to the National Office switchboard \nnumber, below. \n(02) 6271 4411 – AEC switchboard in National Office. This number is published on our \nwebsite along with our state office switchboard numbers. \nInterpreter calls – This is a service where non-English speaking callers can have a three-\nway conversation with the AEC, assisted by an interpreter in their own language. Further \ninformation on this service is available below.  \n\n■ \n\n■ \n\n■  10 Mort St – Security Guards – \n\nHours of operation \nThe switchboard responds to incoming calls received from the general public as follows: \n\n■  Non-election hours of operation – 9am to 5pm (Monday to Friday) \n\nDuring a federal election, the switchboard is diverted to the AECs escalation cell and the INFO \nand Complaints mailboxes are diverted to the AEC’s Election Contact Centre. \n\nPage 4    Public Enquiries Handbook |  \nObjective: SD&F > Roll Ops & Client Services > Public Engagement > Public Enquiries > Policy and Procedure, or \nhttps://objective.prod.aec.gov.au/documents/fA94851\n\n\n--- Page 6 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 7 ---\n\n \n\nthe Objective file path is: Enabling and Regulation Division > Disclosure Assurance and \nEngagement Branch > Parliamentary Engagement and Party Registration Section > \nPublic Engagement; \n\n \n\nthe folder is https://objective.prod.aec.gov.au/documents/fA13482  \n\nThe structure of information contained in the Public Engagement folders is as follows \n\nPublic Engagement Contact Tool \nPublic Engagement are responsible for management of the Public Engagement Contact Tool  \n(PECT) system. \n\nPECT is the AECs official system to record and escalate enquiries and complaints. \n\nAll AEC staff are required to enter all public enquiries, feedback and complaints received. The \nonly exception to this rule is enquiries received in the info@aec.gov.au mailbox – these are \nrecorded separately. Due to the volume of email enquiries we receive, the Public Engagement \nteam is required to enter into PECT all phone calls and emailed complaints only.

The \nexceptions are legal enquiries and complaints – these are to be forwarded via email to the Legal \nMailbox, marked ‘Official’.  \n\nReporting \n\nPage 6    Public Enquiries Handbook |  \nObjective: SD&F > Roll Ops & Client Services > Public Engagement > Public Enquiries > Policy and Procedure, or \nhttps://objective.prod.aec.gov.au/documents/fA94851\n\n\n--- Page 8 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 9 ---\n\nEnglish-speaking callers can have a three-way conversation with the AEC in their own language, \nassisted by an interpreter.   \n\nCalls go to a nominated number in each state. If you receive a call, you will hear an automated \nmessage explaining it is an interpreter call and to press zero (0) to accept the call.   \n\nAlways accept interpreter calls. There is also a range of translated information on our website in \nmore than 30 languages. Please let the caller know this information is available and offer to email \nor mail this information to them, as they may have trouble navigating our website, which is written \nin English. \n\nInvoices from Interpreter companies \nAlthough we have a contract in place with LanguageLoop, we also accept calls made via Home \nAffairs’ TIS. A Spending Approval form must be completed at the start of each financial year for \nTis if we decide to keep accepting interpreter calls from them. This is signed off by the relevant \nbranch delegate, usually our Director.  \n\nAt the start of each month, we receive invoices in the Public Engagement mailbox from both \ncompanies. We also receive a monthly report spreadsheet of itemised calls from Vits in the first \nweek of each month.  Please check the itemised list of calls is correct, as per the instructions \nbelow, before approving any public spending. Once you have approved them, complete and code \nthe invoices and send a copy of the Vits account to Accounts to be paid. The Tis invoice is paid \nby credit card.

It is a government initiative managed through the Australian \nCommunications and Media Authority (ACMA). People are able to call the AEC via the NRS to \nfacilitate the conversation. \n\nWhen you receive an NRS-facilitated call, the relay officer will announce the call to you, such as, \n‘Hello, I have a call for the AEC from the National Relay Service. I have [caller’s name] on the \nline. Please go ahead’.   \n\nYou may find that there is a short delay as the relay officer uses their keyboard to type your \nresponse to the caller and the caller types to the NRS in return. You may hear the relay officer on \nthe line, or in some cases, the caller themselves.  \n\nDuring the call, it may be useful to say ‘Go ahead’ when you have finished speaking. We do not \nreceive invoices for this service. It is a government initiative open to anyone to use. \n\nRecorded messages for switchboard \nCallers who ring the National Office switchboard number (02 6271 4411) outside our business \nhours (9-5pm) will hear a pre-recorded message providing them with information regarding our \nhours of operation.   \n\nPage 9    Public Enquiries Handbook |  \nObjective: SD&F > Roll Ops & Client Services > Public Engagement > Public Enquiries > Policy and Procedure, or \nhttps://objective.prod.aec.gov.au/documents/fA94851\n\n\n--- Page 11 ---\n\nIt is our responsibility to record these messages when they require changing. Prior to each ACT \npublic holiday and the Christmas shutdown period, you will need to ensure this is done. See \nAppendix D for detailed instructions on recording voicemail messages. See Appendix C for a full \ntranscript of each recorded message. \n\nRecorded message (IVR) for 13 23 26 number \nThis is the recorded message on the 13 number. Outside of a federal election, there are \noccasions where you may wish to update this and put a diversion in place. To have the message \nchanged, you must either email the AEC’s telephony section in IT with a request, or submit an IT \nrequest form with the details. Often you will need to provide a week’s notice. Always check it has \ngone through by ringing the 13 number. \n\nGoogle – to update AEC office locations \n\nEmail Procedures  \n\nMailboxes \nThe Public Engagement team are responsible for the following mailboxes: \n\n \n\ninfo \n\nPage 10    Public Enquiries Handbook |  \nObjective: SD&F > Roll Ops & Client Services > Public Engagement > Public Enquiries > Policy and Procedure, or \nhttps://objective.prod.aec.gov.au/documents/fA94851\n\n\n--- Page 12 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 13 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 14 ---\n\nAt the start of each year, the previous year’s content must be moved into the folder titled \n‘Archived Data’. This includes all the sent emails for the previous year. You can do this yourself \nor ask IT Support for assistance. If you are archiving 2020 data for example, a new folder needs \nto be created under 2020 titled ‘Sent’. All emails from the INFO sent folder must be moved into \nthis folder. This makes searching for a sent email a lot faster. This also means at the start of each \nyear, the INFO sent folder will be empty. \n\nINFO Personal Message Manager (PMM) \nThe PMM is a SPAM (junk mail) filter. This works in the background to filter out any incoming \nemails which the AEC IT system thinks may be junk or malicious.  \n\nEach afternoon at 3pm, you will usually receive an email from pmm@aec.gov.au. It contains a \nlink for you to check any emails which the system has deemed to be possible spam or malicious. \nYou must check the spam for each of the three shared mailboxes each day. Also check your \npersonal mailbox.  \n\nTo add the shared mailboxes to your spam filter, refer to the image below. Select the ‘Options’ \ntab in the blue toolbar at the top of the page, then select ‘new’. \n\nEnter the shared mailbox address and select OK. \n\nPage 13    Public Enquiries Handbook |  \nObjective: SD&F > Roll Ops & Client Services > Public Engagement > Public Enquiries > Policy and Procedure, or \nhttps://objective.prod.aec.gov.au/documents/fA94851\n\n\n--- Page 15 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 16 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 17 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 18 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 19 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 20 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 21 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 22 ---\n\nIf the enquiry is an APS staff member, they should be transferred to: \n\nHuman Resources/Payroll  \n\nThere are also Recruitment Officers, WH&S Officers, Rehabilitation Case Managers, etc., which \nyou may need to transfer calls through to. To decide where to transfer the call, open the AEC \nintranet homepage and using the top right-hand search bar, enter the name or area you are \nlooking for. Alternatively there are branch contact lists which can be accessed at the bottom of \nevery intranet page under the heading ‘Offices & branches’. You can also search AEC corporate \ndirectory numbers through your desk phone. \n\nElectoral roll enquiries \nIf a member of the public wishes to view the current electoral roll, a copy is available for public \ninspection at any AEC office. Alternatively, the enquirer can check their enrolment on our \nwebsite. The AEC does not have publicly-available historic rolls. \n\nEnrolment statistics \nIf you receive a request for enrolment stats, not available on our website, please refer it to \n\nRequests for roll data \nAll requests for a copy of the electoral roll from candidates, government agencies or health \nbodies are to be referred to Roll Products in NO at \npublic or commercial organisations, searching for an individual, can be provided with our \nstandard reply.

Refer the enquirer to the Dept. of Finance \nwebsite for information: \n\nhttp://www.finance.gov.au/ \n\nIf they do not have internet access, give the enquirer the following contact details: \n\nPhone: 02 6215 2222 \n\nEnquiry/Complaint from organisation wanting copy of the roll \nThe policy details are outlined in Roll Why – Access to Enrolment Information.  \n\nCurrent roll: \n\nAll requests for the current roll should be referred to Roll Product and services (RPS).  \n\nHistoric roll: \n\nRequests for old electoral rolls. These are available through any local library but only up until \n2004. After 2004, access to the roll was restricted and no longer provided to libraries.  \n\nPrior to 2004 the roll was freely available for purchase. Following the implementation of the \nElectoral and Referendum Amendment (Access to the roll and other measures) Act 2004, the roll \nwas prohibited from sale. \n\nPre-2004 enrolment data may also exist on other internet sites (e.g. ancestry.com). \n\nPage 22    Public Enquiries Handbook |  \nObjective: SD&F > Roll Ops & Client Services > Public Engagement > Public Enquiries > Policy and Procedure, or \nhttps://objective.prod.aec.gov.au/documents/fA94851\n\n\n--- Page 24 ---\n\nCopies of the current electoral roll may only be disclosed to prescribed persons or organisations \nas listed in the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918. \n\nEnrolment Fraud \nIn order to manage the workload associated with the investigation of possible enrolment fraud, \nRMCE and the enrolment network take on a triage role, undertaking the initial investigation of \npotential cases. \n\nAll potential cases of enrolment fraud should now be forwarded to RMCE \nfirst instance. \n\n in the \n\nIndustrial elections and Protected Action Ballots (PAB) \nThe AEC conducts other elections in accordance with the Fair Work Act. \n\nIf you receive any enquiries regarding Industrial Elections or PABs, a list of industrial elections we \nare currently running is available on our website:  \n\nhttps://www.aec.gov.au/ieb/industrial-elections.htm \n\nPlease refer any enquiries either to the relevant state Returning Officer, as per the table below, or \nto: \n\nIndustrial Elections: \n\nPage 23    Public Enquiries Handbook |  \nObjective: SD&F > Roll Ops & Client Services > Public Engagement > Public Enquiries > Policy and Procedure, or \nhttps://objective.prod.aec.gov.au/documents/fA94851\n\n\n--- Page 25 ---\n\nAppendix A \n\nIncoming calls \nIt is important to determine the nature of all calls as a first step. \n\n  The switchboard number receives a fair number of marketing and sales calls. These are \n\nnot to be transferred to staff.  \n\n  You may not confirm any of the following information to a caller: whether a person works \nfor the AEC, a person’s work number, a person’s email address, or the format of AEC \nemail addresses  - e.g. \n\nCalls for Senior Executive Staff (Assistant Commissioners and above).  \n\n  Do not transfer calls from members of the public. Take a message. You could say, “I \ncannot transfer your call to the Electoral Commissioner, but I can take a message and \npass it to her/his office for action.” \n\n \n\nIf the caller identifies themselves as a member or senator, executive office holder \n(President, Vice-President, Secretary) of a major political party, or a person from \nanother Government Agency, contact the relevant Executive Assistant in the \nExecutive Area (for a member of ELT) or Branch Project Officer to discuss. \n\nTransferring a call to an internal number \nTo transfer a call to an internal extension number: \n\n■  When you answer a call, your telephone screen will display a button marked ‘Transfer’. \n\nPress the button. \n\n■  Dial the extension number.  \n■  Wait for the ring tone. \n■  Speak to the EA and provide them with the caller details. \n■ \n■  The call is now transferred. \n\nIf they choose to accept the call, press the button marked ‘Transfer’ again and hang up. \n\nTransferring a call \nIf the call is for an AEC help desk, there is no need to announce the caller before transferring the \ncall. Calls to individual staff can be pre-announced. \n\n■  Press the button marked ‘Transfer’ \n■  Dial the extension number  \n\nPage 24    Public Enquiries Handbook |  \nObjective: SD&F > Roll Ops & Client Services > Public Engagement > Public Enquiries > Policy and Procedure, or \nhttps://objective.prod.aec.gov.au/documents/fA94851\n\n\n--- Page 26 ---\n\n■  Wait for the ring tone.

You can also forward the \nswitchboard phone to another area within the AEC if needed. \n\nThese messages are recorded by us. \n\nStandard Business Hours \nA recorded message is automatically activated each working day. Calls will come through to the \nSwitchboard from 9am each business day until 5pm when callers will receive a message to say \nwe are closed. Provided standard business hours don’t change, you will not need to record a \nmessage for this service. \n\nAt election time, calls go directly to the call centre. As the call centre has extended hours, there is \nno need to record another message. When the call centre is closed, callers will hear our standard \nbusiness hours message. \n\nPublic Holidays  \nOn public holidays a message needs to be recorded to advise callers we are closed. The \nmessages to use are provided below. See Appendix E – Changing the recording on the \nSwitchboard phone. \n\nEmergency  \nThe emergency message is used in the event there is an emergency and it is safe for you to \nrecord a new message.  \n\nForwarding the Public Enquiry phone to another area within the AEC \n\nTo transfer calls to another phone while the Public Engagement team is away \n\nTransferring switchboard to an internal number \n\n  Pick up handset on \n\nphone \n\n  On the phone touchscreen, press Fwd Reception (FR) \n\nPage 26    Public Enquiries Handbook |  \nObjective: SD&F > Roll Ops & Client Services > Public Engagement > Public Enquiries > Policy and Procedure, or \nhttps://objective.prod.aec.gov.au/documents/fA94851\n\n\n--- Page 28 ---\n\n  Enter the five-digit number (or any number you want the calls to be forwarded to).
