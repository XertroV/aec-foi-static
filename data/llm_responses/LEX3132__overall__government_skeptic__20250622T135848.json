            "text": "The FOI documents reveal a process within the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) that suggests a rigid, bureaucratic approach to party deregistration, seemingly prioritizing internal methodologies over a thorough, transparent evaluation of a party's submitted evidence and appeals.\n\n1.  **Lack of Genuine Evaluation of Appeals:** Despite the FOI request specifically asking for evidence of AEC attempts to \"understand and evaluate the arguments put forward by Flux in their February 13th appeal\" and \"the validity of the statistical claims,\" the retrieved communications show no such detailed analysis. Instead, the focus immediately shifts to initiating a *new membership test* on the updated list provided by VOTEFLUX.ORG | Upgrade Democracy! (Flux). This indicates a procedural adherence to re-testing rather than a substantive engagement with Flux's specific counter-arguments or statistical justifications, raising questions about the sincerity of the appeal review process.\n\n2.  **Pre-Determined Outcomes:** Internal communications, such as an email dated March 1, 2022, state that Flux \"did not pass membership testing\" from a *previous* review, even *before* the delegate formally requested a new test on the party's latest membership submission. This chronological order implies a pre-existing conclusion about Flux's eligibility, suggesting that subsequent \"consideration\" and \"new testing\" might have been more of a formality to fulfill legislative requirements rather than a genuine re-evaluation based on new evidence.\n\n3.  **Rigid Adherence to Unexplained Methodology:** The AEC's internal documents consistently state that a \"failure to satisfy the test provided by the ABS alone constitutes reasonable grounds\" for deregistration, \"absent of any relevant factors to the contrary.\" This rigid reliance on a singular, externally sourced methodology, without apparent flexibility to consider a party's unique circumstances or challenges to the methodology itself, suggests a bureaucratic inflexibility that may stifle the legitimate operations of political parties. It implies that a party's detailed arguments or explanations about their membership data are secondary to a statistical test.\n\n4.  **Questionable Membership Testing Parameters:** Despite Flux providing a new membership list of 4,680 names—significantly more than the 1,500 required for registration—the AEC delegate specifically instructed staff to test only the \"top 1,650 names.\" While this is presented as conforming to \"testing methodology parameters,\" it raises concerns about the fairness and representativeness of the sample. Limiting the test to a specific, non-random segment of the provided list could disproportionately impact the party if issues happened to be concentrated within that \"top\" segment, potentially leading to an outcome that doesn't fully reflect the party's overall membership strength."

[SEC=OFFICIAL]\n\nHello Stuart,\n\nThe below request has been prepared to be sent to Joanne, as delegate of the Electoral Commission\nfor the purposes of Part XI of the Electoral Act. VOTEFLUX.ORG | Upgrade Democracy! (the Party) did\nrespond to the s 138A notice, however they did not pass membership testing. It is up to the delegate\nto consider the response within the legislative framework and determine if the Party should be\nderegistered. \nprior to sending to the delegate.\nRegards,\n\n Can you please let me know if you support this\n\nGood morning Joanne\n\nOn 13 February 2022, the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) received the attached statement\n(also accessible at OBJECT ID: A1369037) from the Registered Officer of VOTEFLUX.ORG | Upgrade\nDemocracy! (the Party), \nJanuary 2022 (attached, also accessible at OBJECT ID: A1386429). On 14 February 2022, the Party\n\n, in response to the s 137 Notice issued to the Party on 13\n\n, Secretary and DRO) provided the AEC with an email (the Additional Statement) correcting\n\n“two errors made in the correspondence that I sent you yesterday” (attached, also accessible at\nOBJECT ID: A1386415).\n\nBackground\nOn 3 September 2021, the Electoral Legislation Amendment (Party Registration Integrity) Act 2021\n(Party Registration Integrity Act) came into effect, amending the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918\n(Electoral Act), and increased the membership threshold for an eligible political party to 1,500\nmembers. All registered non-Parliamentary parties, including the Party, had until 2 December 2021 to\ncomply with the legislative requirement to have ‘at least 1,500 members’.\n\nOn 8 October 2021, the Registered Officer of the Party was issued with a notice under s 138A(3) of\nthe Electoral Act (the 138A Notice), requesting the Party provide evidence of compliance with the\nincreased membership requirements and submit a membership list of between 1,500 and 1,650\nmembers by 8 December 2021 (see OBJECT ID: A1157688).\n\ns47Fs47Fs47Fs47Fs47Fs42s47Fs47F\n\n\n--- Page 3 ---\n\nOn 26 November 2021, the AEC sent a reminder to the Party (see OBJECT ID: A1304513).\n\nOn 7 December 2021, the Party responded to the s 138A Notice providing the requested\ndocumentation (OBJECT ID: A1267776). Membership testing was conducted in accordance with the\nmembership testing methodology and formula provided by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS).\n\nA breakdown of the membership testing outcome is at OBJECT ID: A1303995. See below table for a\nsummary of the membership contact outcomes.\n\nThe relevant numbers for this membership test were:\nThe random sample size\nMaximum number of denials permitted\nContact attempts made*\nResponses received\n\nConfirmed Membership\nDenied Membership\n\nPASS/FAIL\n\nMembers\n53\n7\n78\n\n44\n9\nFAIL\n\nOn 13 January 2022, the Party was issued with a notice under s 137(1) of the Electoral Act (the s 137\nNotice), stating that the Electoral Commission is considering deregistering the Party as the Electoral\nCommission is satisfied on reasonable grounds that the Party does not have at least 1,500 members\n(OBJECT ID: A1386429). Pursuant to s 137(2) of the Electoral Act, the Party was provided with one\nmonth to respond to the s 137 Notice (being 13 February 2022).\n\nOn 13 February 2022, the Registered Officer of the Party provided a response to the s 137 Notice\n(OBJECT ID: A1369037) and on 14 February 2022 the Party \nthe Additional Statement (OBJECT ID: A1386415). The Party’s email of 13 February 2022 also included\na membership list in support of the statement which contains 4,680 names (OBJECT ID: A1369039).\n\n, Secretary and DRO) provided\n\nEligibility Provisions\nPursuant to s 138A(1) of the Electoral Act, the Electoral Commission may review the Register to\ndetermine whether a party remains an ‘eligible political party’, or whether it should be deregistered\nunder ss 136 or 137 of the Electoral Act. Under s 123(1) of the Electoral Act an ‘eligible political party’\nmeans a political party that:\n\na.  either:\n\n(i)                  is a Parliamentary party; or\n(ii)                has at least 1,500 members; and\n\nb.  is established on the basis of a written constitution (however described) that sets out the\n\naims of the party.\n\nA ‘Parliamentary party’ means a political party at least one member of which is a member of the\nParliament of the Commonwealth. The Party does not have, and has never had, a member of the\nParliament of the Commonwealth. Section 136 of the Electoral Act pertains to a party failing to\nendorse candidates and therefore is not relevant to this review.\n\nThe issue in question is whether the statement provide by the Party is sufficient for you, as a\ndelegate, to be assured that the Party has ‘at least 1,500 members’. Section 137(1)(b) of the Electoral\nAct first requires the delegate of the Electoral Commission to be ‘satisfied on reasonable grounds’\nthat the Party does not have at least 1,500 members.\n\nLegislative framework\n\ns47F\n\n\n--- Page 4 ---\n\nSection 138A(1) of the Electoral Act outlines the purpose of a s 138A review:\n\nThe Electoral Commission may review the Register to determine whether one or more of the\n\nparties included in the Register:\n\n(a) is an eligible political party; or\n(b) should be deregistered under section 136 or 137.\n\nSections 138A(3 – 5) of the Electoral Act states:\n\n3.  For the purposes of reviewing the Register, the Electoral Commission may give a\nwritten notice to the registered officer of a registered political party requesting\nspecified information on the party’s eligibility to be registered under this Part.\n\n4.  The notice must specify a period within which the information must be provided. The\n\nperiod must be at least 2 months.\n\n5.  The registered officer must comply with the notice within the specified period.\n\nHowever, the Electoral Commission may extend that period.\n\nSection 137(1)(b) of the Electoral Act prescribes that the Electoral Commission is satisfied on\nreasonable grounds that the Party does not have ‘at least 1,500 members’ and therefore does not\nmeet the requirement of being an eligible political party under s 123 of the Electoral Act to remain in\nthe Register of Political Parties (the Register). The Electoral Commission must give the registered\nofficer of the party notice, in writing, that it is considering deregistering the party under this section,\nsetting out its reasons for considering doing so and the terms of the provisions of subsections (2), (3),\n(4) and (5).\n\nSubsections 137(2 – 5) of the Electoral Act includes:\n\n2.  of the Electoral Act prescribes that where a notice is given under subsection (1) in relation to a\npolitical party, the registered officer of the party or 10 members of the party may, within 1\nmonth after the date on which the notice was given, lodge with the Electoral Commission a\nstatement, in writing, signed by the registered officer or by those members of the party, as the\ncase may be, setting out reasons why the party should not be deregistered under this section.\n\n3.  Where a statement lodged under subsection (2) is signed by 10 members of a political party,\n\nthe statement shall set out the names and addresses of those members and contain a\nstatement that they are members of that party.\n\n4.  Where a notice is given under subsection (1) in relation to a political party and a statement is\nnot lodged under subsection (2) in response to that notice, the Electoral Commission shall\nderegister the party.\n\n5.  Where, in response to a notice given under subsection (1) in relation to a political party, a\nstatement is lodged under subsection (2), the Electoral Commission shall consider that\nstatement and determine whether the political party should be deregistered for the reason set\nout in that notice.\n\ns42s42\n\n\n--- Page 5 ---\n\n‘\n\nMembership testing methodology\nUnder the membership testing methodology and formula provided by the ABS it is the Electoral\nCommission’s view that, absent of any relevant factors to the contrary, a failure to satisfy the test\nprovided by the ABS alone constitutes reasonable grounds upon which the delegate of the Electoral\nCommission, can be satisfied that a political party does not have at least 1,500 members.\n\nConsideration of the Statement\nUnder s 137(5) of the Electoral Act, the Electoral Commission shall consider the statement lodged\nunder s 137(2) of the Electoral Act. However, s 137(5) of the Electoral Act stipulates that the Electoral\nCommission shall consider that statement and determine whether the political party should be\nderegistered for the reason set out in that notice. The reasons set out in the s 137 Notice issued to the\nParty was for failing to have at least 1,500 members in response to the s 138A Notice (s 137(1)(b) of\nthe Electoral Act). \n\nUnder s 137(6) of the Electoral Act, where the Electoral Commission determines that a political party\nshould be deregistered, it shall:\nderegister the party; and\ngive the last person who was registered officer of the party written notice of the deregistration,\nsetting out its reasons for rejecting the reasons set out in the statement.\n\nUnder s 137(6A) of the Electoral Act, if the Electoral Commission deregisters a party the Electoral\nCommissioner:\n\nmust publish a notice of the deregistration on the AEC website; and\nmay publish the notice in any other way that the Electoral Commissioner considers appropriate\n(under AEC policy a statement of reasons is published setting out the particulars of the\nderegistration and the basis for rejecting the reasons).\n\ns42s42s42s42\n\n\n--- Page 6 ---\n\nAs the delegate of the Electoral Commission the statement for your consideration is at OBJECT ID:\nA1369035, as well as the Additional Statement at OBJECT ID: A1386415. A summary of that statement\ncan be provided by PEPRS if required. The membership list lodged with the Party’s statement contains\n4,680 names (OBJECT ID: A1369039).\n\nDelegate’s decision\nThe response received by the AEC from the Party in relation to the s 137 Notice issued meets the\nlegislative requirements of s 137(2) of the Electoral Act because it:\n\nwas received within 1 month after the date on which the notice was given;\nIs in writing;\nIs made by the Registered Officer of the Party; and\nOutlines reasons why the Party should not be deregistered.\n\nAs per s 137(5) of the Electoral Act, you, as a delegate of the Electoral Commission, shall consider that\nstatement and determine whether the political party should be deregistered for the reason set out in\nthat notice. In this case, the reason is for failing to have at least 1,500 members (s 137(1)(b) of the\nElectoral Act).\n\nOnce you have considered the Party’s response please advise, by return email, if you believe that\nVOTEFLUX.ORG | Upgrade Democracy! should be deregistered under s 137(1)(b) of the Electoral Act.\nIn your reply email can you please provide statements as to why you made your decision? These\nstatements will form part of a Statement of Reasons if the party is to be deregistered. This email, your\n and the statement from the Party will form part of a formal minute\nresponse, \npending your determination of the eligibility review of the Party.\n\nRegards,\n\n | A/g Senior Project Officer\n\nParliamentary Engagement and Party Registration Section | Disclosure, Assurance & Engagement Branch\nAustralian Electoral Commission\n\ns47Fs47Fs47Fs42\n\nProvide only the markdown formatted summary text.
