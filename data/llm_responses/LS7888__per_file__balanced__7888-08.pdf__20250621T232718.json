            "text": "This document, \"Indigenous Franchise KPIs using Centrelink data,\" outlines the Australian Electoral Commission's (AEC) new methodology for estimating Indigenous electoral participation metrics, primarily enrolment rates, in the absence of an Indigenous identifier on the federal electoral roll.\n\n### Summary of Document\n\nThe document describes a shift from an earlier (2014) indirect estimation method, which used a regression model correlating Indigenous population and franchise KPIs at a small area level, to a more direct approach. The prior method produced \"alarmingly low\" and potentially unreliable rates.\n\nThe core of the new methodology, informally proposed by the Research Section around 2014 and implemented in 2017, involves leveraging person-level Centrelink data extracts that include an Indigenous indicator. While Centrelink data covers about half the electoral roll, it allows the AEC for the first time to identify over 6 million enrolled persons with an explicit Indigenous status.\n\nThe document details a four-step process for calculating the Indigenous enrolment rate:\n1.  Calculating the enrolment proportion for Centrelink clients based on their identified Indigenous or non-Indigenous status.\n2.  Applying these raw rates to Indigenous and non-Indigenous 'Enrolment-Eligible Population' (EEP) benchmarks (derived from ABS projections).\n3.  Scaling these draft enrolments to align with the AEC's overall published enrolment figures.\n4.  Recalculating the adjusted enrolment rates against the EEP benchmarks.\n\nThe document notes that while this new method represents an \"improved approach\" with a \"higher likelihood of robust results,\" it still relies on significant assumptions, such as equal enrolment bias for Indigenous and non-Indigenous Centrelink clients, and acknowledges the figures remain \"indicative only.\"\n\n### Relevance to FOI Request LS7888\n\nThis document is highly relevant to FOI request LS7888, which sought information on the AEC's new methodology for its Indigenous Electoral Participation Program (IEPP), particularly its design, testing, and implementation.\n\n*   **New Methodology Design & Implementation:** The document directly describes the *design* and *implementation* of the core of the AEC's new methodology for estimating Indigenous enrolment rates. It details the shift from unreliable regression models to the direct matching of electoral roll data with Centrelink's Indigenous indicator, noting its implementation in 2017 as part of the Annual Roll Integrity Review.\n*   **Catalyst:** It identifies the \"alarmingly low\" and problematic estimates from the previous indirect methodology, and the ongoing challenge of accurately measuring Indigenous enrolment for \"Closing the Gap\" purposes, as key *catalysts* for the development and adoption of this more robust Centrelink-based approach. The initiative originated internally within the Research Section.\n*   **Tracking & Outcomes:** By detailing the method for calculating Indigenous franchise KPIs, the document explains how the AEC is able to *track* these vital statistics more accurately. This directly supports the FOI overview's mention of improved enrolment estimates (e.g., 76.4% and 76.6%) and the identification of unenrolled Indigenous individuals, which are direct *outcomes* of this methodology.\n*   **Testing:** While not explicitly detailing formal \"testing\" phases, the document's discussion of the method's assumptions, its comparison to less reliable prior models, and its integration into the Annual Roll Integrity Review suggests a move towards a validated and more robust approach.\n*   **Indigenous Involvement/Cost/Staff:** The document provides limited information on Indigenous involvement in the design process or the specific cost and staffing for the project, beyond acknowledging the contributions of the Electoral Integrity Unit and IT Branch."

  "prompt": "Considering this document as part of an FOI request, summarize the document and its relevance to the FOI request in markdown format. FYI the overview of the FOI request is: FOI request LS7888 sought documents (2018-2019) on the Australian Electoral Commission's (AEC) new methodology for its Indigenous Electoral Participation Program (IEPP), specifically its design, testing, and implementation, including catalysts, tracking, outcomes, Indigenous involvement, and cost/staff. The released documents, primarily emails and internal papers, reveal that the core of the new methodology is the direct matching of electoral roll data with Centrelink Indigeneity data, a more robust approach initiated internally to improve accuracy, replacing less reliable prior regression models. This method helped identify over 107,000 unenrolled Indigenous individuals, contributing to enrolment stimulation events (e.g., 2,646 new enrolments). The documents confirm estimated national Indigenous enrolment rates of 76.4% (June 2018) and 76.6% (June 2019), demonstrating a significant upward trend from previous estimates, though they provide limited information on Indigenous involvement in the design process or the final cost and exact staffing for the project.\n\nDocument Text:\n\nIndigenous Franchise KPIs using Centrelink data \n\nBackground \nAs Australia’s federal electoral roll does not have a personal Indigenous identifier, estimating the enrolment, \n rates for Indigenous persons is problematic. Having these key franchise KPIs for the \n\nIndigenous population is important for Closing the Gap purposes and the AECs focus on how the franchise \ncould be better delivered. \n\nIn 2014 the AEC’s Research Section commenced indirect estimation of these figures, using a regression model \nof the relationship between the Indigenous population and each of the three franchise KPIs at a small area \nlevel, such as polling place catchment or the ABS’ SA2 geography. While the models did not fit the data \nparticularly well, the resulting Indigenous enrolment, \nreal data, rather than anecdote. Yet the resulting enrolment and turnout rates in particular were alarmingly \nlow, and hopefully represented a worst case picture. \n\n rates were statistically based on \n\nCentrelink Data \nAround the same time, the Research Section informally proposed that person-level Centrelink extracts that the \nAEC received occasionally for other Roll validation work, could perhaps be extended to include Centrelink’s \nIndigenous indicator. This came to fruition in 20171. \n\nAs part of the Annual Roll Integrity Review (ARIR), the person-level matching between the Roll and Centrelink \nnow included Centrelink’s Indigenous indicator. However as Centrelink customers represent only around half \nof the Roll, the matching (even if perfect) would be far from assigning all enrolments an Indigenous flag. \nNevertheless, for the first time the AEC has a very large number of enrolled persons, over 6 million, with an \nexplicit Indigenous status. \n\nEnrolment Rate\n\n1.\nThe enrolment rate, even for all persons regardless of indigenaity, is difficult to calculate reliably due to \nconceptual, collection and methodological differences between the Roll (numerator) and the ABS-based \nenrolment-eligible population (denominator, “EEP”). In the case of the Indigenous population these problems \nare magnified by having no Indigenous identifier on the Roll and less reliable estimates of Indigenous EEP.  \n\nHowever, matching the Roll to Centrelink data allows a more direct method of estimating the Indigenous \nenrolment rate. It is still subject to quite significant assumptions, but as fewer are required it likely represents \nan improved approach. In summary: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor all Centrelink customers with an identified Indigenous or non-Indigenous status, calculate the\nproportion on the Roll. This is the raw enrolment rate of Centrelink clients.\nApply the raw enrolment rates to Indigenous and non-Indigenous EEP benchmarks2 to yield draft\nIndigenous status enrolments. Calculate the factor to scale these to the overall enrolments used in the\nAEC’s published enrolment rates.\nApply the adjustment factor to the draft Indigenous status enrolments, then recalculate the enrolment\nrates against the EEP benchmarks.\nThis process can be done at the State level, though results will have lower reliability.\n\nNOTE: While this method avoids indirectly modelling Indigenous enrolment rates via geographic \nassociation, it does assume that any bias in Centrelink clients being enrolled is equal for \nIndigenous and non-Indigenous, and that there are no substantive Indigenous-status biases \ninherent in the Roll-to-Centrelink person matching. \n\n1 Acknowledge with appreciation the work of the former Electoral Integrity Unit and the IT Branch. \n2 Indigenous benchmarks use ABS projected adult populations, non-Indigenous are then the residual with published EEP. \n\nLS7888 Released Document No. 81919Released under the Freedom of Information Act 1982\fConclusion and Results \nThe Centrelink client file with Indigenous indicator newly available to the AEC has presented an excellent \nopportunity, via matching to the Roll \n\n, to improve estimation of Indigenous franchise KPIs.  \n\nWhile the results are subject to a number of non-trivial assumptions, the more direct estimation methods lead \nto a higher likelihood of robust results. The figures should nevertheless still be regarded as indicative only. \n\nLS7888 Released Document No. 8191919Released under the Freedom of Information Act 1982 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fReleased under the Freedom of Information Act 1982\fLS7888 Released Document No. 819Released under the Freedom of Information Act 1982\f\n\nProvide only the markdown formatted summary text.
