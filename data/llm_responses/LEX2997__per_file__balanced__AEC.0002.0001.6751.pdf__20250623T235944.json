It requests input on \"upcoming events, key highlights, issues, or potential risks\" for the weekly Executive Leadership Team (ELT) report, with a deadline of 2 pm that day. The previous week's report is attached for reference.\n\n**Relevance to FOI Request:**\nThis document's relevance to the FOI request is primarily administrative. It demonstrates the AEC's internal reporting processes and the types of information (issues, highlights, risks) that are regularly compiled for executive awareness. While the document itself does not contain specific details about the investigation into Andrew Laming MP, it indicates that ongoing high-profile inquiries like the Laming case could potentially be a \"key highlight\" or \"issue\" reported to the AEC's Executive Leadership Team during the period covered by this request for information. It serves as a procedural communication rather than a substantive update on the investigation itself."

Do not include any conversational filler or preamble.To aid you, the overview of the FOI request is: [REQUEST OVERVIEW START] The FOI request disclosed documents detailing the Australian Electoral Commission's (AEC) investigation into Andrew Laming MP's Facebook pages for compliance with federal electoral authorisation laws. This inquiry was triggered by public complaints and media reports, notably from *The Guardian*, alleging Laming used numerous pages (e.g., \"Redland Bay Bulletin,\" \"Redlands Institute\") disguised as community or news groups to promote political content and attack opponents without mandatory disclosures. The AEC confirmed an active investigation, noting 2018 Electoral Act amendments broadened social media authorisation, and issued formal notices to Laming for detailed information and to third parties (like Facebook) for data, with Facebook confirming its cooperation. Findings revealed some pages were removed or updated with authorisation, while others remained active and unauthorised.\n [REQUEST OVERVIEW END] \n\n--- MAIN DOCUMENT TEXT START ---\n\n\n\n--- Page 1 ---\n\nAEC.0002.0001.6751\n\nFrom:                                 Megan MackieSent:                                  Thu, 27 May 2021 11:35:55 +1000To:                                      Community and International EngagementSubject:                             FOR ACTION: ELT Weekly Reporting [SEC=OFFICIAL]Attachments:                   03.
