            "text": "These FOI documents pertain to the Australian Electoral Commission's (AEC) and Australian Bureau of Statistics' (ABS) methodology for verifying non-parliamentary political party membership, a process critical for party registration. From a politically right-leaning perspective, several key themes emerge regarding government efficiency, liberty, fiscal prudence, and the proper scope of government.\n\n**Economic Efficiency and Fiscal Responsibility:**\nThe documents highlight a crucial point regarding the initial AEC sampling methodology: selecting a non-random sub-list of members (e.g., top 1,650 out of 4,680) renders it statistically impossible to draw conclusions about the party's entire membership. This indicates a significant lapse in due diligence and statistical rigor by the AEC in its initial approach. Such methodological flaws inherently lead to economic inefficiency. If the government’s verification process is not sound, it risks misallocating resources on flawed analyses, necessitating re-evaluations, or incurring legal challenges, all of which constitute a burden on taxpayers and inefficient use of public funds.\n\nConversely, the ABS advice emphasizes that larger sample sizes are required for \"low quality\" membership lists (those with a high proportion of non-members). This directly links to fiscal responsibility. The ABS rightly asserts that this system \"relates to the incentives of parties to keep good records of their members and provide the AEC with a high quality list. Providing large low quality lists should be discouraged.\" This aligns with conservative principles of accountability and personal responsibility, placing the onus on political parties to maintain accurate and verifiable records. It discourages the shifting of administrative and verification burdens onto the state, thus reducing the need for costly, extensive government oversight. Furthermore, the advice that filtering names (pre-emptively cleaning lists) works in favour of parties by improving list \"quality\" is an endorsement of processes that encourage self-management and reduce the need for more intensive government intervention, promoting overall economic efficiency.\n\n**Individual Liberty and Limited Government:**\nWhile not explicitly detailing infringements, the potential for flawed government processes to undermine individual liberty is evident. If the government, through its regulatory arm (the AEC), employs statistically unsound methods to verify political party membership, it risks making incorrect decisions regarding party registration or deregistration. This could inadvertently impede the right to free association and participation in the democratic process, representing an incompetent or overreaching exercise of government power. A well-functioning, limited government should ensure its regulatory actions are based on robust and transparent methodologies, thereby avoiding arbitrary decisions that impact citizens' liberties. The public disclosure of these documents via FOI requests, however, does align with principles of transparency and government accountability, offering a mechanism for scrutiny of regulatory actions. The ABS's expert advice serves as a corrective, guiding the AEC towards a more competent application of its regulatory authority, which is essential for a government that is both limited in scope and effective in its legitimate functions.\n\n**National Security:**\nThese documents do not directly touch upon national security matters.\n\nIn conclusion, the documents reveal a mixed alignment with conservative principles. The initial procedural shortcomings of the AEC demonstrate a potential deviation from principles of economic efficiency and competent limited government. However, the expert advice from the ABS provides a roadmap for greater fiscal responsibility by incentivizing parties to maintain quality records and underscoring the importance of statistically sound methods, ultimately supporting a more efficient and properly constrained regulatory environment."

At that meeting we discussed the ABS \n\nThank you for meeting with \nmethodology for sampling and testing membership of political parties used by the AEC. You kindly reviewed some \nquestions we had and considered some issues raised by applications for review of the decision to deregister \nVoteFlux.Org | Upgrade Democracy! (the Party). The purpose of this email is to summarise the key points raised in \nthat discussion. I would be grateful if you could confirm that I have set out your advice correctly. If not, I would be \ngrateful if you could edit the response or reply clarify any points.  \n\nIf possible, we would be grateful for your response by Monday 1 July 2022. We may provide this information to the \nElectoral Commission for the purposes of their review of the decision to deregister the Party. \n\n1. What conclusions can be drawn in relation to the list of 4680 names in the Party’s list, following the delegate’s \ndecision to test the top 1,650 names of that list (the sub-list)? \n\nWith respect to the test conducted it is not the randomisation or not that is causing the false rejection (or false \nacceptance) rate to land outside the limits. It is the sample size that control the test conditions. If you had \nrandomised you would have been able to say something about the whole list as the final sample (probabilistically) \nwould have referred to the 4680 not just the 1650. Nevertheless you still would have needed a bigger sample size to \nget the desired risk rates.  \n\nYou advised that as the Party’s list was not randomised before the sub-list was made (as only the top 1650 names \nwere selected) it is not possible to draw any meaningful statistical conclusions about the Party’s whole list of 4680 \nfrom the results of testing the sub-list. You can only say something about the selected 1650. This is because, without \nrandomisation there is no chance of the other records being selected. You explained this by the analogy of \nattempting to sample from a deck of cards for aces. Having failed to first shuffle the deck, chunking the bottom half \naway, and then sample from what is left will not give you useful information about all original cards. Those thrown \naway were never in the running. \n\nThe test done indicates a list with low proportion of eligible members among the 1650. \n\nDELETE As would usually be the case, as the test of the sub-list failed, it is possible to conclude (to the level of \nconfidence to which the test is set) that the sub-list of 1,650 did not include 1,500 members.  \n\n2. What are the alternative options for testing the larger list? \n\nYou explained that a larger sample size would be required to test a large list to the same degree of confidence. \nCurrent sampling is calibrated so that the probability of accepting an invalid list is less than 2%, and the probability \nof falsely rejecting a valid list is less than 6%. You estimated that the sample size required to test the full list of 4680 \nnames would be over 300. You also advised that excel spreadsheet calculator provided to the AEC could provide \ninformation about the sample size required to test a list of 4680 names to different levels of confidence.  \n\nWe have now used the calculator (attached), to calculate that sampling a list of 4680 members, where the desired \nprobability of false rejection is 6% and the desired probability of false acceptance is 2%, would require an \napproximate sample size of 564 and a maximum number of denials allowed of 399.     \n\n3. Does filtering names affect the error rates? \n\nYou explained that in your view, the arguments made in \n paper with respect to filtering names increasing \nthe error rate are without foundation. You explained that, provided the filtering process is done in accordance with \nthe ABS methodology, filtering names works in favour of parties by removing from a list members who would not \nhave been capable of meeting the requirements.  \n\nCorrect this would improve the ‘quality’ of the list and decrease the occurrence of finding denials (non-members) in \nthe list sample. \n\n4\n\nsection 47FS 47F\n\n\n--- Page 5 ---\n\n4. Your general comments on \n\n paper \n\n hypothetical example. That example \nYou considered that it was not instructive to consider in depth \nstarted from the premise that the party has more than 1,500 and sought to prove that a specific list could be \nrejected by the sampling methodology.  \n\nYou agreed with the general proposition that if the correct sampling size was not adopted in relation to a larger list, \nthe likelihood of false rejection increased. This is shown by the calculator.  \n\nWe also discussed generally the rationale for requiring a smaller sampling size as a practical and fair method for \ntesting party lists. We discussed the difficulties of testing a larger list.  Since the requirement is minimum 1500 a \nparty with a very large list that is ‘low quality’ in the sense that it contains a high percentage of non-members will \nrequire a very big sample size to control false rejection risks. This relates to the incentives of parties to keep good \nrecords of their members and provide the AEC with a high quality list. Providing large low quality lists should be \ndiscouraged.  \n\nLegal Services Section | Legal & Procurement Branch \nAustralian Electoral Commission \n\nDISCLAIMER: \n\nIf you have received this transmission in error please notify us immediately by return email and delete all copies.
