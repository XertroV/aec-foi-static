Kaye, a former Flux officer, contended that the AEC's methodology for testing party membership eligibility was fundamentally flawed, using detailed statistical analysis to demonstrate an extremely high probability of false negatives (over 99.99% for a hypothetical eligible party) and arguing that the test was \"rigged\" and a \"farce.\" His critique highlighted issues such as sampling bias (only A-G names sampled for Flux), an artificially limited sample size (1,650 names maximum allowed for submission regardless of actual membership), and a method that could become less reliable as a party gained members. Kaye asserted that the AEC's policies systematically disadvantaged non-parliamentary parties, enabling the entrenchment of existing political power."

  "prompt": "Create a concise, single-paragraph summary in markdown format of the following FOI request summary:\n\nSummary:\n\nThis FOI request (No. LEX1785) sought the application made by Mr. Max Kaye under section 141(2) of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 on 14 April 2022 to the Electoral Commission.\n\nThe single document released in response is **\"Application made under section 141(2) of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 by Mr. Max Kaye\"**, dated 14 April 2022.\n\nThe main content of the document, focusing on the FOI request, includes:\n\n*   **Purpose of the Application:** Mr. Max Kaye (a founder and former officer of The Flux Party) requests the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) to review its decision, made on 24 March 2022, to deregister \"VOTEFLUX.ORG | Upgrade Democracy!\" (Flux) under s137(6) of the Electoral Act.\n*   **Core Argument for Review:** Kaye contends that the AEC uses a \"faulty method to test party eligibility with regards to sufficient membership\" and provides detailed statistical analysis as grounds for this claim. He states he is \"dissatisfied with the decision to deregister Flux\" due to this flawed methodology.\n*   **Critique of AEC's Methodology:**\n    *   **Hypothetical Scenario:** Kaye presents a hypothetical eligible party (2,700 legitimate members out of 9,000 total, 4,500 validatable). Despite this eligibility, his calculations show that such a party would have an extremely low probability of passing the AEC's test (0.0020% ± 0.0012% chance of success), implying a false negative rate exceeding 99.99%.\n    *   **Application to Flux:** He states that the parameters of the hypothetical case are \"spitting distance\" from Flux's second membership test (Feb/March 2022). For Flux specifically, the test results in a false negative probability of 0.999978 ± 0.000013.\n    *   **Sampling Bias:** During Flux's second test, the AEC sampled only the \"top 1,650 names\" from Flux's alphabetically sorted list of 4,680 members. This meant only members whose first names started with A through G were sampled, which Kaye argues further biases the test if membership isn't evenly distributed alphabetically.\n    *   **Limited Sample Size:** The AEC's policy limits submitted membership lists to 1,650 names (previously 550), regardless of a party's actual, larger membership. This artificial limit significantly compromises the accuracy of the test and means a party with thousands of eligible members can still fail.\n    *   **Definition of \"Rigged\" and \"Farce\":** Kaye explicitly defines the AEC's method as \"rigged\" (outcome pre-arranged/fixed, unfair) and a \"farce\" (unfair, empty act, done for show with a known outcome) because of its high false negative rate for eligible parties.\n*   **Analysis of Flux's Tests:**\n    *   Flux failed its 2021 test, despite having \"at least 4680 members whose details have been matched against the electoral roll.\" Kaye's analysis showed a 71.7% chance of a false negative for this test.\n    *   He argues that the AEC's method can become *less* reliable as a party *gains* members, and in some extreme (yet realistic) scenarios, it can fail 100% of the time for an eligible party.\n*   **Critique of AEC's \"Reasons\" for Deregistration:** Kaye asserts that the AEC's statement of reasons for deregistering Flux ignored his arguments, dismissed the statistical analysis, and contradictorily relied on the very method he criticized, stating it was \"rational, fair and practical.\"\n*   **Systemic Implications:** Kaye argues that the AEC's policies, particularly the limits on membership list submissions, have \"systemically disadvantaged non-parliamentary parties\" and made the AEC \"complicit\" in entrenching the power of political elites by making it harder for new or smaller parties to remain registered.\n*   **Supporting Data:** The document includes detailed statistical graphs (Probability Mass Functions) and tables to illustrate the probabilities of false negatives under various conditions, alongside historical examples of other \"suspected farces\" (past deregistration/refusal cases with high false negative probabilities). It also highlights a persistent typo in historical AEC testing tables that was enforced.\n\nProvide only the markdown formatted summary text. Do not include any conversational filler or preamble."
