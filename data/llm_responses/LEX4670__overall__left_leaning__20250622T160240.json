For a digital communication that is communicated by a disclosure entity which \nis not a natural person, this means that at a minimum, the Advertisements should contain the \nname of the relevant person responsible for authorising the Advertisements, along with the \nname and town/city of the relevant entity (Authorisation Particulars).  \n\n7. \n\nAs you would be aware, section 12 of the Authorisation Determination outlines further \nrequirements as to: \n\n(a) \n\nthe way in which the authorisation should be communicated, including with respect to the \nplacement of the authorisation on the relevant communication; and  \n\n(b) \n\nformatting of the authorisation.   \n\n8. \n\nIn terms of the placement of the authorisations on the Advertisements, we note the following \nwith respect to the Advertisements.  \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\nThe Advertisements are digital communications, and are accordingly subject to the \nrequirements outlined under section 12 of the Determination.    \n\nThe Advertisements are each communicated in the form of a stationary image.  They are \nalso each accompanied by text.  Neither of these forms are referred to in section \n12(2)(a)-(c) of the Authorisation Determination.  The requirements of section 12(2)(d) \ntherefore apply.  \n\n(c) \n\nThe Authorisation Particulars can be viewed and/or accessed via two locations on each \nof the Advertisements.  These are as follows.  \n\n(i) \n\nThe stationary images contained in the Advertisements each include the text \n‘yes23.com.au’ at the foot of the images.  Yes23.com.au is a URL that can be used \nto access Yes23’s official website, which contains the Authorisation Particulars at \nthe foot of the home page.  This form of placement is expressly permitted by \nsection 12(2)(d)(ii) of the Authorisation Determination.   \n\n(ii)  Our client has taken the additional step of authorising its Facebook page via the \n\n‘About Us’ section.  The effect of doing so is that the Authorisation Particulars can \n\n4164723.1 \n\n2\n\n\n--- Page 3 ---\n\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 1 ---\n\nFrom:\nTo:\nCc:\nSubject:\n\nDate:\nAttachments:\n\nAuthorisation Section\n\n; Authorisation Section\n\nRE: Correspondence from the Australian Electoral Commission - Yes23 Authorisation Requirements (Our\nRef: LEX4002) [Marque-DOCUMENTS.FID104572] [SEC=OFFICIAL]\nMonday, 24 July 2023 2:12:16 PM\nLEX4002 - Yes23.pdf\nimage001.jpg\nimage002.jpg\n\n,\n\nDear \nPlease find attached correspondence from the Australian Electoral Commission.\nIf you have any queries, please email authorisationsection@aec.gov.au.\nKind Regards,\n\nElectoral Authorisation Team\nAustralian Electoral Commission\nT: 13 23 26\n\nFrom: \nSent: Friday, July 21, 2023 3:07 PM\nTo: Authorisation Section <authorisationsection@aec.gov.au>\nCc: \nSubject: Correspondence from the Australian Electoral Commission - Yes23 Authorisation\nRequirements (Our Ref: LEX4002) [SEC=OFFICIAL] [Marque-DOCUMENTS.FID104572]\nCAUTION: This email originated from outside of the Australian Federal Government.
