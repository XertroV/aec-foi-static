This ongoing engagement focused on developing \"Electoral communications escalation scenarios,\" establishing clear communication channels, and implementing protocols to combat misinformation and disinformation in anticipation of the 2022 Federal election, including discussions on TikTok's public service announcements and fact-checking partnerships, and Meta's new reporting portal.\n [REQUEST OVERVIEW END] \n\n--- MAIN DOCUMENT TEXT START ---\n\n\n\n--- Page 1 ---\n\nReleased by Australian Electoral Commission under the Freedom of Information Act 1982 s 22s 22s 22s 22s 22s 47G(1)\n\n\n--- Page 2 ---\n\nReleased by Australian Electoral Commission under the Freedom of Information Act 1982 s 22s 22s 22s 22s 22s 22s 22\n\n\n--- Page 3 ---\n\nReleased by Australian Electoral Commission under the Freedom of Information Act 1982 s 22s 22s 22s 22s 22s 22\n\n\n--- Page 4 ---\n\nReleased by Australian Electoral Commission under the Freedom of Information Act 1982 s 22s 22s 22s 22s 22\n\n\n--- Page 5 ---\n\nReleased by Australian Electoral Commission under the Freedom of Information Act 1982 s 22s 22s 22s 22s 47G(1)s 47G(1)s 47G(1)s 22s 47G(1)\n\n\n--- Page 6 ---\n\nReleased by Australian Electoral Commission under the Freedom of Information Act 1982 s 22s 22s 22s 22\n\n\n--- Page 7 ---\n\nReleased by Australian Electoral Commission under the Freedom of Information Act 1982 s 22s 22s 22s 22s 22\n\n\n--- Page 8 ---\n\nReleased by Australian Electoral Commission under the Freedom of Information Act 1982 s 22s 22s 22s 22\n\n\n--- Page 9 ---\n\nReleased by Australian Electoral Commission under the Freedom of Information Act 1982 s 22s 22s 22s 22\n\n\n--- Page 10 ---\n\nReleased by Australian Electoral Commission under the Freedom of Information Act 1982 s 22s 22s 22\n\n\n--- Page 11 ---\n\nReleased by Australian Electoral Commission under the Freedom of Information Act 1982 s 22s 22s 22s 22\n\n\n--- Page 12 ---\n\nReleased by Australian Electoral Commission under the Freedom of Information Act 1982 s 22s 22s 22s 22\n\n\n--- Page 13 ---\n\nReleased by Australian Electoral Commission under the Freedom of Information Act 1982 s 22s 22s 22s 22s 22s 22s 22s 22\n\n\n--- Page 14 ---\n\nReleased by Australian Electoral Commission under the Freedom of Information Act 1982 s 22s 22s 22s 22\n\n\n--- Page 15 ---\n\nReleased by Australian Electoral Commission under the Freedom of Information Act 1982 s 22s 22s 22s 22\n\n\n--- Page 16 ---\n\nReleased by Australian Electoral Commission under the Freedom of Information Act 1982 s 22s 22s 22s 22s 22s 22s 22\n\n\n--- Page 17 ---\n\nReleased by Australian Electoral Commission under the Freedom of Information Act 1982 s 22s 22s 22s 22s 22s 22s 22\n\n\n--- Page 18 ---\n\nReleased by Australian Electoral Commission under the Freedom of Information Act 1982 s 22s 22s 22s 22\n\n\n--- Page 19 ---\n\nReleased by Australian Electoral Commission under the Freedom of Information Act 1982 s 22s 22s 22s 22s 22s 22\n\n\n--- Page 20 ---\n\nReleased by Australian Electoral Commission under the Freedom of Information Act 1982 s 22s 22s 47G(1)s 47G(1)s 47G(1)\n\n\n--- Page 21 ---\n\nReleased by Australian Electoral Commission under the Freedom of Information Act 1982 s 47G(1)s 47G(1)s 22s 22s 22s 22s 22\n\n\n--- Page 22 ---\n\nReleased by Australian Electoral Commission under the Freedom of Information Act 1982 s 22s 22s 22s 22s 22s 22\n\n\n--- Page 23 ---\n\nReleased by Australian Electoral Commission under the Freedom of Information Act 1982 s 22s 22s 22s 22s 22s 22s 22s 22\n\n\n--- Page 24 ---\n\nReleased by Australian Electoral Commission under the Freedom of Information Act 1982 s 22s 22s 22s 22s 22s 22s 22s 22s 22s 22s 22s 22\n\n\n--- Page 25 ---\n\nReleased by Australian Electoral Commission under the Freedom of Information Act 1982 s 22s 22s 22s 22s 22s 22s 22s 22\n\n\n--- Page 26 ---\n\nReleased by Australian Electoral Commission under the Freedom of Information Act 1982 s 22s 22s 22s 22s 22s 22s 22s 22\n\n\n--- Page 27 ---\n\nReleased by Australian Electoral Commission under the Freedom of Information Act 1982 s 22s 22s 22s 22s 22s 22s 22s 22s 22s 22s 22s 22\n\n\n--- Page 28 ---\n\nReleased by Australian Electoral Commission under the Freedom of Information Act 1982 s 22s 22s 22s 22s 22\n\n"
