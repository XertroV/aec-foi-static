Google also requested the AEC formalize the request by replying to an original receipt email for \"proper process.\"\n*   **Resolution:** By May 1, 2022, Google confirmed that the problematic video had been \"blocked in Australia\" and that a formal notification of this action had been sent to the AEC.\n*   **AEC Monitoring:** The AEC's Electoral Integrity Assurance Taskforce (EIAT) and Social Media team were included in the correspondence, indicating their role in monitoring such content moderation requests.\n\n### Relevance to FOI Request (LEX3037)\n\nThis document is highly relevant to FOI request LEX3037 as it provides a concrete example of the AEC's proactive engagement with major tech companies, specifically Google (YouTube), during the 2022 federal election. It illustrates the operational effectiveness of the \"Electoral Integrity Assurance Taskforce\" in identifying and addressing electoral misinformation through direct communication channels and content referrals, directly aligning with the FOI request's focus on safeguarding election integrity by addressing non-compliant content."
