Do not include any conversational filler or preamble.To aid you, the overview of the FOI request is: [REQUEST OVERVIEW START] FOI Request LEX3047 obtained Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) documents concerning complaints made primarily in April and May 2019 about electoral advertisements lacking authorisation or being misleading. The released materials include public email complaints and the AEC's responses to various entities like \"Our Vote Our Community\" and \"Bass Deserves Better\" Facebook pages, \"RiteOn!\" website, and other media. The complaints predominantly highlighted the absence of required authorisation details on political advertising across digital and print platforms, with some also raising concerns about misleading \"community group\" portrayals or unauthorised paid ads. In response, the AEC consistently clarified 'electoral matter' and authorisation requirements under the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918, requested subjects to add necessary authorisations, cease distribution of non-compliant materials, and advised on potential penalties up to $25,200 for non-compliance, as well as obligations for \"disclosure entities.\"\n [REQUEST OVERVIEW END] \n\n--- MAIN DOCUMENT TEXT START ---\n\n\n\n--- Page 1 ---\n\nFrom:\nSent:\nTo:\nSubject:\n\ncom\n\nSaturday, 13 April 2019 9:19 AM\nLegal Services Mailbox\n[COMPLAINT Political advertising] \n[SEC=UNCLASSIFIED]\n\n (2010) *WWW* \n\nComplaint \n\nCategory \n\nPolitical advertising \n\nPrimary Details \n\nGiven name(s): \nSurname: \nOrganisation: \nEmail: \nPhone number: \n\nElectoral division: \n\nComplaint Details \n\nNo authorisation for misleading ads \nhttps://www.facebook.com/Our-Vote-Our-Community-353462745204606/ \n\nExpected Outcome \n\nAdditional Information \n\nAddress: \nLine 2: \nLocality: \nState: \nPostcode: \n\n1\n\n47F47F47F47F47F47F47F47F47F47F47F\n\n"
