The plan for secondments was to be developed by December 2023, with placements occurring from January to June 2023, aiming for better relationships and resource allocation.\n*   **Wellbeing:** Focuses on staff having dedicated time and space for strategic thinking through monthly activities, ongoing from June 2023. The intended impact is for staff to strategically plan their work in connection with the agency and broader government.\n*   **Strategic thinking:** Aims to enhance understanding of agency functions and connections to the branch's work by inviting guest speakers from relevant stakeholder areas to meetings, focusing on roles and responsibilities. This activity is ongoing from June 2023.\n*   **Communication:** Includes inviting specific roles (AC and BPO) to section meetings, also ongoing from June 2023, to foster a better understanding of agency functions and their connection to the branch's work.\n\nAll listed actions are designated as the responsibility of 'Directors and AC'. The plan also specifies that progress will be discussed at monthly branch meetings and updated on Census Action Plan posters in each section to ensure continued focus and communication."
