The core content shows the ABS providing advice and detailed methodologies (e.g., via Document 1 and 3, which includes a sample table) to the AEC. The AEC, in turn, engages with this advice (Document 2). Crucially, Document 4, an internal AEC minute, indicates that the ABS's input directly informed and led to the AEC's approval of a \"methodology policy\" for membership testing. Document 5 suggests ongoing communication related to this advice. These documents collectively demonstrate the ABS's role in advising the AEC on developing its approach to verifying party membership.\n\nProvide only the markdown formatted summary text. Do not include any conversational filler or preamble."
