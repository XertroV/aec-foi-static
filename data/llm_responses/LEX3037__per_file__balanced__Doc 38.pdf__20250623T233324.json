It shows the AEC's proactive engagement during the 2022 federal election period to identify, refer, and have \"non-compliant content\" addressed by platforms. While not directly about misinformation/disinformation, it demonstrates the AEC's efforts to safeguard election integrity by addressing issues impacting its operations and staff on social media, aligning with the Electoral Integrity Assurance Taskforce's role in monitoring and addressing problematic content."
