            "text": "The released FOI documents reveal a deeply concerning and potentially manipulative exercise disguised as objective research, aimed at influencing a critical democratic process. Rather than an impartial assessment, this \"supplemental report\" by Dr. Michael Turner, commissioned by the law firm Harpur Phillips, reads as a partisan hit piece designed to provide pseudo-scientific justification for suppressing a new political entity, \"The New Liberals.\"\n\n**Damning Evidence of Partisan Manipulation and Conflict of Interest:**\n\n1.  **Partisan Affiliation:** The most egregious failure is the author's affiliation. Dr. Michael Turner is employed by **C|T Group Research. Strategies. Results.** (formerly Crosby Textor). C|T Group is a notoriously partisan political consultancy firm with deep, well-documented ties to the Liberal Party in Australia and conservative parties globally. To present a report from such a source as \"expert\" and \"impartial\" in a matter concerning the registration of a party with a similar name to the Liberal Party is a staggering conflict of interest and a direct assault on the integrity of the electoral process. His past work at the UK's ONS or Electoral Commission, while presented to bolster credibility, serves only to highlight the betrayal of research ethics when working for a politically biased entity.\n\n2.  **Commissioned for a Legal Outcome:** The report was \"instructed\" by Harpur Phillips, a law firm, specifically to \"provide a further supplementary report.\" This unequivocally confirms it was a legal brief, not an independent academic study. Its purpose was to generate evidence to support a pre-determined legal position, likely to assist the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) in denying \"The New Liberals\" registration, thereby protecting the established Liberal Party from an electoral threat.\n\n3.  **Lack of Transparency – Redaction and FOI Requirement:** The fact that this critical report, which underpinned a decision impacting democratic participation, had to be retrieved via an FOI request by Paul Farrell (suggesting a lack of public transparency) and arrived \"Redacted\" is a glaring red flag. What information is being hidden? The redactions imply details that the government, or the commissioning party, does not want scrutinized, further eroding confidence in the report's findings and the decision it supported.\n\n**Methodological Failures and Deliberate Bias:**\n\n1.  **Leading Research Questions:** The stated purpose of the research, \"Does the inclusion... make it more difficult for voters...?\" and \"Does the inclusion... lead to confusion...?\", are inherently leading questions. They assume confusion exists and seek to quantify its \"impact,\" rather than neutrally investigating *if* it exists. This sets the stage for a predetermined outcome.\n\n2.  **Manipulative Experimental Design (Ballot D):** The inclusion of \"Ballot D: New Liberals are displayed but the Liberal Party is not displayed\" is a blatant attempt to artificially inflate \"confusion.\" In a real election, the Liberal Party would always be present. Removing it creates an unrealistic scenario designed to force voters to consider \"The New Liberals\" in a vacuum, maximizing the chance of misattribution and making any claim of \"confusion\" utterly unreliable. This is not scientific rigor; it is electoral engineering.\n\n3.  **Post-Vote \"Correction\" (Q24):** The most damning question, Q24, actively manipulates respondent data. After respondents indicate a vote for \"The New Liberals,\" they are *then* provided with \"clarifying\" information (e.g., \"no connection or relationship to the Liberal Party\") and prompted to \"confirm that you intended to vote for The New Liberals... or did you intend to vote for another party?\" This is not measuring initial confusion; it's *inducing* it and then \"correcting\" it to generate a quantifiable error rate, creating the illusion that initial votes for \"The New Liberals\" were \"mistakes\" due to confusion, rather than genuine choices.\n\n4.  **Biased Question Wording and Options:** The questionnaire is riddled with questions (e.g., Q16-Q21, Q26-Q27) designed to push respondents towards confirming a perceived connection, rebrand, or confusion between the parties. Options are framed to reinforce the desired narrative, offering limited scope for respondents to express that they see the parties as clearly distinct or have no confusion.\n\n5.  **Flawed Sampling Methodology – Opt-in Panels and Low Response Rate:**\n    *   The reliance on \"commercially available panel providers\" using an \"online, random invitation, stratified design\" is a common but fundamentally flawed method for sensitive public opinion research. These are opt-in, non-probability samples, inherently biased towards individuals willing to take surveys for payment, and cannot be considered truly representative of the electorate.\n    *   A \"20.4% response rate\" is abysmal. This means nearly 80% of invited participants did not respond, introducing massive potential for non-response bias. The author's dismissal of more robust (probability-based) methods like CAPI or even telephone surveys due to cost (\"prohibitively expensive for little additional benefit\") and declining response rates is a transparent excuse for cutting corners and using a less rigorous, more controllable method.\n    *   Weighting (\"calibration weights\") can adjust for known demographic imbalances but cannot correct for the fundamental unknown biases inherent in an opt-in, non-probability sample. It polishes a flawed dataset, but does not fix its underlying unreliability for legal or regulatory purposes.\n\n**Incompetence or Malice?**\n\nThe consistent methodological choices, all tending towards confirming confusion and association, coupled with the author's affiliation with a partisan political firm, point to either staggering incompetence in basic research design or, more likely, a deliberate and malicious attempt to construct a flawed study to achieve a predetermined political outcome.\n\nThe AEC's reliance on such a demonstrably biased and methodologically unsound report to make a decision about party registration represents a severe failure of due diligence and an abdication of its role as an impartial arbiter of Australia's democratic processes. It suggests that the AEC, whether knowingly or negligently, accepted evidence manufactured to serve the interests of an established political party, undermining the fairness and perceived integrity of the electoral system itself.\n\nIn essence, these documents expose a potential abuse of power where \"research\" appears to have been weaponized to prevent legitimate political competition, cloaked under the guise of protecting voters from \"confusion\" that the study itself was designed to induce and then \"prove.\""

Qualifications & Experience \n\n4.1. \n\nI am a trained social and political scientist, having worked in the fields of \nsocial, political and market research for more than a decade. I am qualified in \nthe practice of research methods, having completed methods-based courses \nat both Bachelors and Masters degree level. My full curriculum vitae is \nprovided in appendix 1. \n\n4.2.  My Masters degree in Social Research covered many areas of research \n\nmethods, including quantitative data analysis, survey design, sampling and \nanalysis of quantitative results. My Masters thesis focused on the \nquantitative analysis of public opinion data. \n\n1\n\n\n--- Page 2 ---\n\n4.3. \n\n4.4. \n\n4.5. \n\n4.6. \n\n4.7. \n\nI continued methods training during my doctoral studies in Political Science \nat The Elections Centre, Plymouth University. My PhD thesis focused \nsignificantly on the quantitative analysis of elections results and survey data1. \n\nSince my academic studies, I have continued training, attending many \nrenowned courses on survey design and analysis, across several institutions \nand industry bodies. Most relevant to this research, are the methods courses \nthat I have attended at the University of Essex, the University of Vienna, and \nthe University of Oxford. \n\nI have also conducted industry recognised short courses in experimental \nsurvey designs run by the Market Research Society in the UK. All these \ncourses have some relevance for the conduct and analysis of this research \nproject. \n\nI am a certified member of the Market Research Society (MRS), a member of \nthe Research Society (RS) and a Fellow of The Royal Statistical Society \n(RSS).  \n\nBeing members of these industry bodies binds me to higher standards of \nprofessional practice of research and statistical analysis. I am obliged, in my \nprofessional activities, to uphold the MRS Code of Conduct, to comply with \nthe RS Code and abide by the RSS Code of Conduct. \n\n4.8.  My experience also includes working to produce representative and accurate \n\nsurveys that gather official population estimates, for the Office for National \nStatistics (ONS), the national statistics agency for the UK. \n\n4.9. \n\n4.10. \n\n4.11. \n\nDuring my time as an Assistant Methodologist in the methodology \ndepartment at the ONS, I specialised in sample design and estimation, \nworking on projects such as the Census Non-Response Linkage Study \n(CNRLS), which sought to understand how to make opt-in surveys more \naccurate by using data from the Census, which is compulsory. \n\nI was also responsible for the sample design of several key surveys, to \nensure that they were representative of the population. \n\nSince my time at the ONS, I have held senior positions at several leading \nsocial, political and market research firms. \n\n4.12.  Though I am a methods generalist, I have built up substantial expertise in \nquantitative survey methods, design, and analysis. I have produced robust \nresearch and insight for a range of academic institutions, corporations, \nmedia, charitable organisations, government, and official agencies, including \nthe ONS and the Electoral Commission in the UK. \n\n1 Turner, M (2014).

Purpose of the Project & Considerations \n\n5.1. \n\nThe purpose of this research project was to provide robust evidence to \nidentify the impact of including a political party named “The New Liberals” \ninto the voting process in Australian Federal elections. The following \nquestions guided the research design and analysis of results: \n5.1.1. \n\nDoes the inclusion of a party called ‘The New Liberals’ make it more \ndifficult for voters to correctly identify the political party that they \nwant to vote for? \nDoes the inclusion of a political party called ‘The New Liberals’ lead \nto confusion, among voters, about the nature of the relationship \nbetween ‘The New Liberals’ and other political parties, that are \nalready registered? \n\n5.1.2. \n\n5.3. \n\n5.4. \n\n5.2.  When designing the research approach required to sufficiently answer these \nresearch questions, several primary criteria were taken into account. \nFirst, it is important to have the ability to simulate the voting process as \nclosely as practically possible in a private environment, free from interviewer \nand social desirability biases.  \nThe voting process is a text-based exercise for voters. They follow written \ninstructions, not oral ones. The ballot paper is not read aloud for all voters by \npolling officials. As is outlined in the Australian Electoral Commission’s \n(AEC’s) own official resources, it is important “to read and follow the \ndirections on the ballot paper to make sure your vote is counted”2. In other \nwords, the best way to simulate the voting process is for our sample to take a \ntext-based, self-completion approach. \nSecond, to firmly establish whether voters were confused, or truly able to \ncorrectly identify their political party of choice, the ability to convey more \ndetailed information to voters, about each political party, after they have \ngiven their vote intention, would be required. \nTo know if The New Liberals are seen by voters as a separate political party \nfrom existing ones, or a related, or even the same political party, we must be \nable to corroborate voters’ intentions. We can do this by presenting them \nwith non-political, factual information about each party, that will not appear \non the ballot paper, and therefore cannot be considered simply in the act of \nvoting. \nInformation such as the party leader, the year of their formation and the \nnature of the relationship between the parties has to be presented to voters \n\n5.6. \n\n5.5. \n\n5.7. \n\n2 Voting in Australia, Australian Electoral Commission, pp14, URL: https://education.aec.gov.au/teacher-\nresources/files/voting-in-australia.pdf \n\n3\n\n\n--- Page 4 ---\n\n5.8. \n\n5.9. \n\nfor them to make an informed decision about who the party is, and whether \nthey intended to vote for them. \nFinally, the ability to run an experimental design is essential in order to \nprovide robust evidence that establishes the causal effect of inclusion of ‘The \nNew Liberals’ on the ballot, and the magnitude of any electoral impact. \nFor this reason, a sample size of more than n=2,000 would be required to \nprovide sufficient confidence in the estimates provided. This will mean that \neach of the four different ballot papers required to be evaluated will have a \nminimum sample of approximately n=500. \n\n5.10.  The ballot designs were as follows.  \n\nBallot A: The New Liberals are not displayed (a control ballot A to compare \nresults against).  \nBallot B: The New Liberals are displayed below the Liberal Party (test ballot). \nBallot C: The New Liberals are displayed above the Liberal Party (test ballot). \nBallot D: New Liberals are displayed but the Liberal Party is not displayed \n(test ballot). \nBy simulating different levels of prominence for the Liberal Party and The \nNew Liberals, while keeping other factors constant, the experimental design \nballot evaluation can confirm whether inclusion of The New Liberals \ndisproportionately confuses Liberal voters. \nIf voters felt The New Liberals were an entirely separate party, unrelated to \nthe Liberal Party, then there is no reason to suggest that their inclusion and \nposition on the ballot would disproportionately impact on the Liberal party, \nwhile leaving other political parties, across the political spectrum, relatively \nunchanged. \n\n5.11. \n\n5.12. \n\n5.13.  An example ballot paper for Federal elections to the House of \n\nRepresentatives (Figure 1, Appendix 4) shows clearly that a Liberal Party of \nAustralia candidate and a candidate for The New Liberals can be placed \nsome distance away from each other (due to random order of the \ncandidates/political parties). Therefore, there is a high chance that voters will \nsee and read ‘The New Liberals’ before knowing if there is a candidate \nstanding for the Liberal Party. \nIn this scenario, ballot order effects are very likely to lead to erroneous \nresults if voters conflate the two parties or if they feel that two parties are \nrelated or connected in the same way that other the Coalition parties are, or \ndivisions within political parties.  \n\n5.14. \n\n4\n\n\n--- Page 5 ---\n\n5.15.  The ballot order effect is well-known phenomenon confirmed by the \n\nacademic publications for both experimental election design3 and for actual \nelection results in the UK4, and Australia5. \n\n5.16.  Given these primary considerations, it is clear that a computer-assisted, self-\ncompletion, text-based approach would be required for this research. \nIt is worth noting that a telephone survey approach was ruled out on several \ngrounds, including, but not limited to: \n5.17.1. \n\n5.17. \n\n5.17.2. \n\n5.17.3. \n\n5.17.4. \n\nFirst, that the introduction of an interviewer in the process could \nlead to erroneous effects, such as interviewer and social \ndesirability biases, which are well known in social and market \nresearch6. \nSecond, the inability to simulate as closely as practically possible, \nthe voting process, such as reading instructions and observing a \nmock ballot. \nThird, in order to verify whether voters intended to vote for a \nparticular party, there is a requirement to convey significant and \ndetailed information about several political parties to voters. It is an \nunreasonable expectation for voters to answer this question on an \ninformed basis, without it available to them to consider in written \nform. \nFourth, telephone response rates have been in significant decline in \nrecent years7, and when probability-based survey designs have low \nresponse rates, the tools that are used for remediation, are similar, \nif not identical, to those used for non-probability samples8. This \nmeans there is likely no benefit in taking a telephone or a paper-\nbased approach from a sampling perspective. The bias introduced \nby high levels of non-response is unlikely to guarantee more \naccurate results than an adequately weighted non-probability \ndesign. \n\n5.18.  The only probability-based survey approach that would yield any material \n\nbenefit to the sample design, whilst meeting the modal criteria, would have \nbeen a simple random sample, household, computer assisted personal \n\n3 Johnson, J & Miles, C (2011).

This approach would have been both impractical, and prohibitively expensive \nto conduct, for little additional benefit to a research project of this scope and \nnature. Even for a very short survey, the fieldwork required would have taken \nseveral weeks, and could have cost several hundred thousand dollars. \n5.20.  Trained and experienced researchers regularly make judgements about the \n\n5.21. \n\nsize and scope of studies that are required to give adequate evidence to \nanswer research questions. Researchers identify the appropriate approach \nand design, based on the timeframe, resources and level of precision \nrequired to come to a set of conclusions that we can be confident about. \nIn conclusion, given the objectives of this research project, and key \nconsiderations outlined above, it is my expert view that the optimal approach \nand most appropriate research design for this project, was for the survey to \nbe conducted online, via a self-completion survey approach, of sufficient \nsample size (n=2000+), using commercially available panel providers, taking \ncareful consideration of the sample design (i.e. stratification), and following \nbest practice guidance on questionnaire design and analysis of results. \n\n6.  Overview of Approach \n\n6.1. \n\n6.2. \n\n6.3. \n\n6.4. \n\nThe overall approach taken was typical of much of the high-quality public \nopinion and market research that is produced for academic, commercial, and \npublic policy focused organisations. Though there are very slight differences \nacross the designs, the general approach is similar to polls such as ANUPoll9, \nNewspoll10, the Global Consumer Confidence Index11, and polling by the Lowy \nInstitute12. \nThe research findings are based on results from survey responses of \nn=2,036 voters aged 18 years and over, who are eligible to vote in Australian \nFederal Elections. \nThe fieldwork was conducted between the 6th and 9th of March 2021 using an \nonline approach. \nThe online research panel comprised a number of traditional actively \nmanaged market research panels that either adhere to the ESOMAR \nstandards or are ISO20252 certified. Multi-source sampling approach aimed \nto mitigate any potentially inherent bias that might occur from using a single \nsource of online sample. \n\n9 Methodology, ANUPoll, Australian National University, \nhttps://csrm.cass.anu.edu.au/research/surveys/anupoll/methodology \n10 Ramadila, N (2018).

Invitations were sent at random (a \ndouble-blinded selection process) to members of online panels, via a \nstratified design with proportions set according to age-sex interlocking and \nstate/territory. These were based on Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) \nCensus results from 2016. \nThe questionnaire design, fieldwork, and analysis of survey results followed \ncode of conduct and best practice guidance from both The Research \nSociety13 and the Market Research Society14. \nAs per industry standards, all participants gave their consent for survey \nresponses to be used for market research purposes, by opting-in to the \nstudy via a process of informed consent. \nCalibration weights were used to ensure that the final sample was \nrepresentative of the Australian electorate, using weighting targets derived \nfrom official population statistics, and Federal election results collected by \nthe Australian Electoral Commission (AEC). \n\n7.  Questionnaire Design \n\n7.1. \n\n7.2. \n\n7.3. \n\n7.4. \n\n7.5. \n\nThe questionnaire (Appendix 1) was developed with the intention of collecting \nquantitative evidence that is both representative and statistically \ngeneralisable, to help answer the research questions detailed above. \nCareful consideration was given to the questionnaire design. Specifically, \ncare was taken to minimise any bias that may arise from question ordering, \nwording, or the order of response options. \nTo ensure that the survey conformed to the established understanding of \nsurvey response processes, such as ensuring the comprehension of \nquestions, that they have reasonable retrieval and judgement requirements, \nand have adequate response frames15, the survey was drafted entirely by me, \ndrawing on my more than 10 years of experience as a social researcher and \na highly qualified market research professional. \nAs is standard practice in market research, the survey was then piloted on a \nsmall sample of respondents (n=30). An optional, text response, feedback \nbox was given at the end of the survey, which returned no queries or \nconcerns about the design of questions, or the questionnaire overall. \nThe feedback box was then removed, before the survey was full launched for \nthe remaining n=2,006 responses. \n\n7.6.  Where practical, the order of questions, and question response options were \n\nrandomised. These have been detailed in the questionnaire (Appendix 1). \n\n13 Best practice for interviews and questionnaires, The Research Society, April 2021, URL: \nhttps://researchsociety.com.au/documents/item/2800 \n14 MRS Guidelines for Online Research (2014), Market Research Society, URL: \nhttps://www.mrs.org.uk/pdf/2014-09-01%20Online%20Research%20Guidelines.pdf  \n15 Tourangeau, R et al (2000). The Psychology of Survey Response, Cambridge University Press, pp7-16 \n\n7\n\n\n--- Page 8 ---\n\n7.7. \n\nKey considerations that were taken into account in the questionnaire design \ninclude: \n7.7.1. \n\nEnsuring that key prevalence questions, such as 9a, 9b, 9c, 9d, 11, \n12, 13, and 14, were placed earlier in the survey to ensure that \nstatements containing both the name and details of ‘The New \nLiberals’ did not have an influence on responses to these questions. \nPrevalence questions are designed to accurately measure the \nproportion of people with a particular view, or voting intention, at a \nparticular timepoint. To get accurate results it is important to \nminimise the placement of subjective content that may raise their \nawareness of an issue, or in this case a political party, in advance of \nasking them. \nQuestions that were less likely to be impacted by the presentation \nof new information to respondents, such as attitudinal statements \nrequiring judgment, or clarification of previous responses, were \nasked towards the end of the survey in order to ensure that the \nnew information did not impact on questions that sought to identify \nwhat voters understood about the specific nature of the \nrelationship between the Liberal Party of Australia, and ‘The New \nLiberals’. \n\n7.7.2. \n\n7.7.3.  Where practically possible, question answer options were either \n\nrandomly rotated, or the direction of agree/disagree Likert scales16 \nwas randomly assigned (i.e. randomly ‘flipped’) in order to ensure \nthat the order of response options did not impact or bias results in \na particular way (Appendix 2). \n\n7.8. \n\n7.9. \n\nGiven the requirement for quantitative results that are both robust and \ngeneralisable, the use of clear and plain language closed questions was \nfavoured over ‘loosely framed’ open questions. \nSurvey researchers tend to favour closed-ended questions as they are \nsimpler to understand and help clarify the meaning of the question for \nrespondents (see Tourangeau et al. 200017). \n\n7.10.  Open-ended questions can suffer from issues of generalisability, \n\ncategorisation, and bias, including but not limited to: \n7.10.1. \n\nRespondents to open-ended questions will often give different \ndegrees of detail when answering, which can be associated with \ndifferent levels of engagement. If more engaged respondents give \nclearer, more thorough, and more detailed responses, then this will \nsignificantly bias the coding and classification of their responses in \nfavour of a more highly engaged set of respondents. \n\n16 A Likert scale is a closed-ended scale question, that enables people to self-report the extent to which \nthey agree or disagree with a given proposition. \n17 Tourangeau, R et al (2000). The Psychology of Survey Response, Cambridge University Press, pp231 \n\n8\n\n\n--- Page 9 ---\n\n7.10.2.  Using open-ended questions can lead to some answers becoming \nunconnected or lost in detail that is either insignificant or irrelevant \nto the topic we are interested in. An average voter cannot be \nexpected to understand intricate detail of the Commonwealth \nElectoral Act. So, in circumstances where the subject matter may \nbe difficult to understand, or requires significant expertise, or \nbackground knowledge, it is better for research professionals to \ncraft clear and easy to understand closed questions. \n\n7.10.3.  Analysis can become too focused on answers from respondents of \n\nadvantaged groups, such as the highly literate, older respondents, \nthose who regularly write or use computers, which will bias results \nin favour of the experienced and technically skilled18, and could \nresult in greater survey drop-out rates19. \n\n7.11. \n\nThese concerns are just some that led the report author to conclude that \nopen-ended questions would provide little, if any, additional benefit for this \nresearch project. Consequently, the questionnaire design favoured an \napproach that gave respondents as much freedom of response as was \nreasonable, within a closed-end response environment. \n\n7.12.  The questionnaire design followed code of conduct and best practice \n\nguidance from both The Research Society and the Market Research Society. \nMarket research industry guidance includes a requirement that participants \nof any market research process should give their consent to participate in \nthe study on an informed basis about how their response data will be used. \nThis is the case, no matter the mode through which data is collected, online, \ntelephone, or face-to-face. \n\n7.13.  All respondents of this study were informed that their responses would be \nanonymised and used for market research purposes (Appendix 1). The final \nsample of respondents opted-in to the research process by giving their \nconsent for use of their data for research purposes. \n\n8.  Survey Sample \n\n8.1. \n\nThe process taken to achieve a representative sample of Australian voters \nfor this research project, is similar in nature, to other online market research \nprojects that I have been commissioned to undertake in the past. It is now a \nstandard industry approach used regularly by social and market research \nfirms, for commercial and government clients, in Australia and globally. \n\n18 Reja, U et al (2003).

These panel providers are \nresponsible for engaging, recruiting, and managing approximately 1.57 million \nresidents living in Australia. \nParticipants are typically paid a small and standardised fee to take part in \nmarket research surveys, based on the length of each survey that they \ncomplete. \nA wide range of social and market research studies, for commercial and \ngovernment clients, is conducted in this way. \nAlthough I was responsible for the sample design (i.e. setting the strata and \nfinal sample targets), and for designing and hosting the online questionnaire, I \nwas not responsible for inviting Australian residents to participate and had no \nknowledge or means to invite people to take part. This was the responsibility \nof the panel provider. \nRespondents were invited through a randomised, double-blinded process. \nNeither me, nor the online panels, nor respondents, influenced which specific \nindividuals could take part. The process for selecting panellists to invite, is an \nautomated and randomised one. \n\n8.8.  Once the stratification targets were set, panellists were selected at random \n\nwithin key strata. Sample stratification targets were age-sex interlocking and \nstate/territory. These were based on Australian Bureau of Statistics \npopulation estimates and data from the 2016 Census. The target sample \nstructure can be found in table 1, below. \nThese selected panellists were then invited to take part in a study, the \ncontent of which they did not know. \nIn total, 71 panels were used, via an intermediary exchange. \nThe panel provider sends all randomly selected panellists a notification, \nusually via email, but also via other means, that contains the length of the \nsurvey, the expected reward for completion, and a web address link to the \nsurvey. No information about the survey’s subject or content is provided in \nadvance. \nIf they have received the invitation, and would like to take part, then they can \nclick the link in the invitation where they will be taken to the start of the online \nhosted survey. The survey was hosted and run by me. \n\n8.9. \n\n8.10. \n8.11. \n\n8.12. \n\n8.13.  When they arrive at the web address, they are given information about how \n\ntheir data may be used and the length of the survey. They will be asked to \nconsent to their data being used for market research purposes, which forms \nthe basis of question 1 of the questionnaire (Appendix 2). \n\n10\n\n\n--- Page 11 ---\n\n8.14. \n\n‘Soft’ quota survey completion caps were set for age-sex groups (10%), and \nstate/territories (25%) in order to mitigate the effects of differential non-\nresponse. This is a typical approach used widely in market and social \nresearch20. \n\n8.15.  Approximately 11,110 respondents were invited to take part in the survey. \n8.16.  The total number of eligible residents who started the survey was n=2,265, \n\nthis puts the estimated response rate at approximately 20.4%, which is \nconsidered typical for online research21. \n\n8.17.  After screening, the survey had a completion rate of 90%, meaning that of \n\nthe 2,265 people who started the survey, 2,036 completed it. \n\n8.18.  The final completed sample size was n=2,036 respondents, who were all \n\n8.19. \n\nAustralian residents aged 18 years and over, and eligible to vote in Australian \nFederal elections. This forms the final dataset used for analysis.  \nIt is now standard in the social and market research industry to assign \nconfidence intervals to similarly designed online survey research. Examples \ninclude but are not limited to; YouGov’s Newspoll22 which takes a classical \napproach to calculating the margin of error, and online polling conducted by \nmarket research firm Ipsos MORI23 which uses Bayesian Credibility \nIntervals24. \n\n8.20.  Online, random invitation, stratified design approaches have also been shown \n\nto be as accurate, if not more so, than modern-day random digit dial (RDD) \ntelephone surveys, with the correct weighting approach25. \n\n8.21.  The ‘panel providers’ used were actively managed market research suppliers, \n\nand all are ISO2025226 compliant and all comply with the standards that \nESOMAR27 provides. \n\n8.22.  These suppliers recruit panellists using a variety of approaches, including but \nnot limited to, random probability designed surveys, face-to-face and \ntelephone studies, referral programmes, direct marketing, and online adverts. \nIn order to mitigate any inherent bias that might occur from using a single \nsource of panel provider, based on their recruitment or management style, a \n\n8.23. \n\n20 What are opinion polls?

The results show that final, pre-weighting sample is reasonably close to \n\nexpected counts based on official population statistics. This suggests that \nthe sample is, generally, of a good quality. \n\n9.  Post-Fieldwork Weighting \n\n9.1. \n\nTo ensure the results were both accurate, and generalisable, calibration \nweights were applied to the final collected data. Calibration weighting is an \napproach for reducing the error of population estimates that are produced \nfrom a survey sample by, applying mild adjustments to the sample. \nCalibration weighting does this by adjusting certain ‘calibration’ variables, to \nequal known, or better-estimated population totals. \n\n9.2.  Weighting targets included age-sex interlocking, state/territory, level of \n\n9.3. \n\n9.4. \n\n9.5. \n\n9.6. \n\n9.7. \n\n9.8. \n\n9.9. \n\neducation and 2019 Federal election primary vote. \nTargets were derived from population statistics collected by the Australian \nBureau of Statistics (ABS), as well as the results of the 2019 Federal election \ncollected by the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC). \nA raking technique was used for calculating the weights, which is a typical \napproach in market and social research28. \nThe smallest weight assigned was 0.46, and the largest weight was 2.32, \nsuggesting that the weighting efficiency was good, and the final collected \nsample was reasonably close to national population statistics for weighting \ntargets. \nThe effective sample size is a measure of the precision of a survey sample. \nEven if a survey research study has a sample of 1,000 respondents, an \neffective sample size of 500 would suggest that the final weighted results \nare no more robust than a well-executed, but un-weighted simple random \nsample of 500 respondents. So, it is important to take the weighting design \ninto consideration when assigning confidence to survey research. \nTaking the weighting design into account, the final efficiency for this study \nwas 91.5%. This means that across the study as a whole, results for the poll \nhad an approximate effective sample size of n=1,863. \nPlease note that efficiency estimates will vary slightly across the question \nresults as the impact of the weight differs slightly for different statistics \ncalculated. \nAn approximate margin of error breakdown has been calculated for the study \ntoplines at the 95% confidence level (Table 2 below). \n\n28 Mercer, A et al (2018).
