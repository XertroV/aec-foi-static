It describes a shift from an earlier (2014) indirect regression model, which yielded \"alarmingly low\" and less reliable estimates, to a more direct approach leveraging Centrelink's self-identified Indigenous status data.\n\nBeginning in 2017, the AEC integrated Centrelink's Indigenous indicator into its Annual Roll Integrity Review (ARIR) through person-level matching, providing explicit Indigenous status for over 6 million enrolled persons. The new methodology involves:\n1.  Calculating the raw enrolment rate for identified Indigenous and non-Indigenous Centrelink clients.\n2.  Determining an adjustment factor by comparing the overall AEC enrolment rate with the Centrelink-based rate.\n3.  Applying this factor to derive adjusted Indigenous and non-Indigenous enrolment rates.\n\nWhile acknowledging that the results are indicative and rely on certain assumptions, the document concludes that this method provides a \"higher likelihood of robust results.\" It presents indicative national non-enrolment figures for 30 June 2017, showing a 29% non-enrolment rate for Indigenous Australians (implying a 71% enrolment rate) compared to 3% for non-Indigenous Australians. The development of this method is attributed to the AEC's Research Section, with acknowledgment to the former Electoral Integrity Unit and the IT Branch.\n\n**Relevance to FOI Request LS7888:**\n\nThis document is highly relevant to FOI request LS7888, which sought information on the AEC's new methodology for its Indigenous Electoral Participation Program (IEPP) from 2018-2019.\n\n*   **New Methodology:** The document directly addresses the core of the FOI request by detailing the *new methodology* for estimating Indigenous electoral enrolment using Centrelink data, replacing the previous 2014 model. This shift from an indirect, less accurate method to a more direct, data-driven approach is a central theme of the request.\n*   **Planning & Implementation:** It outlines the genesis of this shift, from an \"informal proposal\" by the Research Section to its \"fruition in 2017\" and integration into the ARIR, indicating the planning and initial implementation phases within the requested timeframe.\n*   **Outcomes:** The document provides initial *outcomes* of this new methodology, presenting estimated Indigenous non-enrolment rates for 2017 that are significantly higher (indicating lower non-enrolment) than those implied by the previous methodology's \"alarmingly low\" figures mentioned in the FOI overview (e.g., 71% enrolment vs. ~58%). This demonstrates the immediate impact of the methodological change on reported rates.\n*   **Indigenous Involvement:** The document does *not* explicitly detail the number of Indigenous people involved in the methodology's development, which was a specific aspect of the FOI request that the released content did not fully address.\n*   **Costs/Staffing:** Similarly, the document does *not* explicitly detail the final costs or dedicated AEC staffing associated with the development or ongoing use of this methodology. It only mentions the AEC sections involved.\n*   **Timeline:** Dated May 2018 and presenting 2017 data, the document falls squarely within the 2018-2019 period of the FOI request, providing insight into the foundational work and early results of the new methodology."

  "prompt": "Considering this document as part of an FOI request, summarize the document and its relevance to the FOI request in markdown format. FYI the overview of the FOI request is: FOI request LS7888 sought documents from 2018-2019 concerning the Australian Electoral Commission's (AEC) new methodology for its Indigenous Electoral Participation Program (IEPP), specifically regarding its planning, implementation, outcomes, Indigenous involvement, and costs. The released documents reveal the AEC transitioned to a more direct method for estimating Indigenous electoral enrolment rates, primarily by utilising self-identified Indigeneity data from Centrelink. This shift, driven by the availability of new Centrelink data, significantly increased estimated Indigenous enrolment rates from approximately 58% (under the old 2014 methodology) to 76.4% by June 2018 and 76.6% by June 2019. The documents detail the new methodology, its impact, and efforts to track enrolment stimulation, including identifying over 72,000 potentially unenrolled Indigenous Australians in mid-2018 and subsequent enrolment events. However, the released content did not explicitly detail the number of Indigenous people involved in the methodology's development or its final costs and dedicated AEC staffing.\n\nDocument Text:\n\n\n\n--- Page 1 ---\n\nIndigenous Franchise KPIs using Centrelink data \n\nBackground \nAs Australia’s federal electoral roll does not have a personal Indigenous identifier, estimating the enrolment, \n rates for Indigenous persons is problematic. Having these key franchise KPIs for the \n\nIndigenous population is important for Closing the Gap purposes and the AECs focus on how the franchise \ncould be better delivered. \n\nIn 2014 the AEC’s Research Section commenced indirect estimation of these figures, using a regression model \nof the relationship between the Indigenous population and each of the three franchise KPIs at a small area \nlevel, such as polling place catchment or the ABS’ SA2 geography. While the models did not fit the data \nparticularly well, the resulting Indigenous enrolment, \nreal data, rather than anecdote. Yet the resulting enrolment and turnout rates in particular were alarmingly \nlow, and hopefully represented a worst case picture. \n\n rates were statistically based on \n\nCentrelink Data \nAround the same time, the Research Section informally proposed that person-level Centrelink extracts that the \nAEC received occasionally for other Roll validation work, could perhaps be extended to include Centrelink’s \nIndigenous indicator. This came to fruition in 20171. \n\nAs part of the Annual Roll Integrity Review (ARIR), the person-level matching between the Roll and Centrelink \nnow included Centrelink’s Indigenous indicator. However as Centrelink customers represent only around half \nof the Roll, the matching (even if perfect) would be far from assigning all enrolments an Indigenous flag. \nNevertheless, for the first time the AEC has a very large number of enrolled persons, over 6 million, with an \nexplicit Indigenous status. \n\nEnrolment Rate\n\n1.\nThe enrolment rate, even for all persons regardless of indigenaity, is difficult to calculate reliably due to \nconceptual, collection and methodological differences between the Roll (numerator) and the ABS-based \nenrolment-eligible population (denominator, “EEP”). In the case of the Indigenous population these problems \nare magnified by having no Indigenous identifier on the Roll and less reliable estimates of Indigenous EEP.  \n\nHowever, matching the Roll to Centrelink data allows a more direct method of estimating the Indigenous \nenrolment rate. It is still subject to quite courageous assumptions, but as fewer are required it likely \nrepresents an improved approach. In summary: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor all Centrelink customers with an identified Indigenous or non-Indigenous status, calculate the\nproportion on the Roll. This is the raw enrolment rate of Centrelink clients.\nCalculate the ratio of the actual AEC enrolment rate versus the Centrelink-based rate, for the same\npoint in time. This is the overall factor to adjust any Centrelink-based rates to align with AEC\nenrolment rates.\nApply the adjustment factor to raw Centrelink-based enrolment rates by Indigenous status to give\nIndigenous and non-Indigenous enrolment rates.\nThis process can be done at the State level, though results will have lower reliability.\n\nNOTE: While this method avoids indirectly modelling Indigenous enrolment rates via geographic \nassociation, it does assume that any bias in Centrelink clients being enrolled is equal for \nIndigenous and non-Indigenous, and that there are no substantive Indigenous-status biases \ninherent in the Roll-to-Centrelink person matching. \n\n1 Acknowledge with appreciation the work of the former Electoral Integrity Unit and the IT Branch. \n\n1919LS7888 Released Document No. 6Released under the Freedom of Information Act 1982\n\n\n--- Page 2 ---\n\nConclusion and Results \nThe Centrelink client file with Indigenous indicator newly available to the AEC has presented an excellent \nopportunity, via matching to the Roll \n\n, to improve estimation of Indigenous franchise KPIs.  \n\nWhile the results are subject to a number of non-trivial assumptions, the more direct estimation methods lead \nto a higher likelihood of robust results. The figures should nevertheless still be regarded as indicative only. \n\n191919LS7888 Released Document No. 6Released under the Freedom of Information Act 1982\n\n\n--- Page 3 ---\n\nINDIGENOUS-STATUS FRANCHISE KPIs \n\nNon-enrolment (2017) \n\nKPI \n\nIndigenous  \n29% \n\nNon-\nIndigenous  \n3% \n\n^ enrolment \n\nINDIGENOUS-STATUS (NON-)ENROLMENT \n30 June 2017 \n\nState \n\nNSW \nVIC \nQLD \nSA \n\nWA \nTAS \nNT \nACT \nAUST \n\nIndigenous  \n17% \n28% \n32% \n34% \n39% \n19% \n30% \n26% \n29% \n\nNon-\nIndigenous  \n2% \n4% \n4% \n3% \n3% \n3% \n2% \n1% \n3% \n\nNotes: \nThese modelled national estimates contain many assumptions and cannot be ascribed to any particular sub-national location. \nThe absence of an Indigenous identifier on the Federal Roll has been partially supplemented with Centrelink information. \n\nThese figures can be footnoted \"unofficial internal AEC modelling\". \nBusiness Intelligence, Research and Electoral Integrity Section. 8 May 2018. \n\n19191919LS7888 Released Document No. 6Released under the Freedom of Information Act 1982\n\n\n--- Page 4 ---\n\nREDACTION CODES \n\nPersonal Information (name) redacted. \n\nPersonal Information (date of birth) redacted. \n\nPersonal Information (photograph) redacted \n\nPersonal Information (facsimile of signature) redacted. \n\nPersonal Information (facsimile of manuscript initialling) redacted. \n\nPersonal Information (Individual’s address) redacted. \n\nPersonal Information (individual’s telephone number) redacted. \n\nPersonal Information (individual’s opinion) redacted. \n\nPersonal Information (opinion about individual) redacted. \n\nPersonal Information (employment history) redacted. \n\nPersonal Information (qualifications) redacted. \n\nPersonal Information (health) redacted. \n\nPersonal Information (identifying individual) redacted. \n\nBusiness information (Bank Account details) redacted. \n\nBusiness information (Billing Account details) redacted. \n\nBusiness information (internal operations) redacted. \n\nLegal Professional Communication redacted. \n\nDeliberative material redacted. \n\nIrrelevant material redacted. \n\nElectoral Roll material redacted. \n\nTests, examinations or audits material redacted. \n\nManagement or assessment of personnel material redacted. \n\nProper and efficient conduct of the operations of AEC material redacted. \n\nLawful methods or procedures for preventing, detecting, investigating, or \ndealing with matters arising out of, breaches or evasions of the law. \n\nTrade Secrets. \n\nCommercial valuable information. \n\nFinancial interests of the Commonwealth. \n\nProperty interests of the Commonwealth. \n\n1 \n\n2 \n\n3 \n\n4 \n\n5 \n\n6 \n\n7 \n\n8 \n\n9 \n\n10 \n\n11 \n\n12 \n\n13 \n\n14 \n\n15 \n\n16 \n\n17 \n\n18 \n\n19 \n\n20 \n\n21 \n\n22 \n\n23 \n\n24 \n\n25 \n\n26 \n\n27 \n\n28\n\nProvide only the markdown formatted summary text.
