            "text": "This document, \"Indigenous Franchise KPIs using Centrelink data,\" outlines the Australian Electoral Commission's (AEC) transition to a new methodology for estimating Indigenous electoral enrolment rates. It details the limitations of the previous 2014 regression model, which produced \"alarmingly low\" and statistically unreliable figures due to the absence of an Indigenous identifier on the electoral roll. The document describes the informal proposal and subsequent implementation (from 2017) of a more direct method leveraging self-identified Indigeneity data from Centrelink. This new process involves matching electoral roll data with Centrelink customer records (over 6 million, representing approximately half the roll) to establish Indigenous status, then applying these enrolment rates to Indigenous and non-Indigenous Enrolment-Eligible Population (EEP) benchmarks. The document concludes that despite some inherent assumptions, this Centrelink-based approach offers an \"excellent opportunity\" for improved estimation and yields a \"higher likelihood of robust results\" compared to the prior indirect modelling.\n\n**Relevance to FOI Request LS7888:**\n\nThis document is central to FOI request LS7888 as it directly addresses the AEC's \"new methodology for its Indigenous Electoral Participation Program (IEPP).\"\n\n*   **Planning and Implementation:** It details the strategic planning (informal proposal by the Research Section) and the timeline of implementation (came to fruition in 2017 as part of the Annual Roll Integrity Review) of the Centrelink-based method. This directly explains the shift from the 2014 methodology.\n*   **Outcomes:** While not stating the specific enrolment percentages, the document explains the methodological change that underpins the significant increase in estimated Indigenous enrolment rates (e.g., from 58% to over 76%) as noted in the FOI request overview, framing the new approach as leading to more \"robust results.\"\n*   **Indigenous Involvement and Costs:** Consistent with the FOI overview, this document does not explicitly detail the number of Indigenous people involved in the methodology's development or its specific final costs and dedicated AEC staffing."

  "prompt": "Considering this document as part of an FOI request, summarize the document and its relevance to the FOI request in markdown format. FYI the overview of the FOI request is: FOI request LS7888 sought documents from 2018-2019 concerning the Australian Electoral Commission's (AEC) new methodology for its Indigenous Electoral Participation Program (IEPP), specifically regarding its planning, implementation, outcomes, Indigenous involvement, and costs. The released documents reveal the AEC transitioned to a more direct method for estimating Indigenous electoral enrolment rates, primarily by utilising self-identified Indigeneity data from Centrelink. This shift, driven by the availability of new Centrelink data, significantly increased estimated Indigenous enrolment rates from approximately 58% (under the old 2014 methodology) to 76.4% by June 2018 and 76.6% by June 2019. The documents detail the new methodology, its impact, and efforts to track enrolment stimulation, including identifying over 72,000 potentially unenrolled Indigenous Australians in mid-2018 and subsequent enrolment events. However, the released content did not explicitly detail the number of Indigenous people involved in the methodology's development or its final costs and dedicated AEC staffing.\n\nDocument Text:\n\n\n\n--- Page 1 ---\n\nIndigenous Franchise KPIs using Centrelink data \n\nBackground \nAs Australia’s federal electoral roll does not have a personal Indigenous identifier, estimating the enrolment, \n rates for Indigenous persons is problematic. Having these key franchise KPIs for the \n\nIndigenous population is important for Closing the Gap purposes and the AECs focus on how the franchise \ncould be better delivered. \n\nIn 2014 the AEC’s Research Section commenced indirect estimation of these figures, using a regression model \nof the relationship between the Indigenous population and each of the three franchise KPIs at a small area \nlevel, such as polling place catchment or the ABS’ SA2 geography. While the models did not fit the data \nparticularly well, the resulting Indigenous enrolment, \nreal data, rather than anecdote. Yet the resulting enrolment and turnout rates in particular were alarmingly \nlow, and hopefully represented a worst case picture. \n\n rates were statistically based on \n\nCentrelink Data \nAround the same time, the Research Section informally proposed that person-level Centrelink extracts that the \nAEC received occasionally for other Roll validation work, could perhaps be extended to include Centrelink’s \nIndigenous indicator. This came to fruition in 20171. \n\nAs part of the Annual Roll Integrity Review (ARIR), the person-level matching between the Roll and Centrelink \nnow included Centrelink’s Indigenous indicator. However as Centrelink customers represent only around half \nof the Roll, the matching (even if perfect) would be far from assigning all enrolments an Indigenous flag. \nNevertheless, for the first time the AEC has a very large number of enrolled persons, over 6 million, with an \nexplicit Indigenous status. \n\nEnrolment Rate\n\n1.\nThe enrolment rate, even for all persons regardless of indigenaity, is difficult to calculate reliably due to \nconceptual, collection and methodological differences between the Roll (numerator) and the ABS-based \nenrolment-eligible population (denominator, “EEP”). In the case of the Indigenous population these problems \nare magnified by having no Indigenous identifier on the Roll and less reliable estimates of Indigenous EEP.  \n\nHowever, matching the Roll to Centrelink data allows a more direct method of estimating the Indigenous \nenrolment rate. It is still subject to quite significant assumptions, but as fewer are required it likely represents \nan improved approach. In summary: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor all Centrelink customers with an identified Indigenous or non-Indigenous status, calculate the\nproportion on the Roll. This is the raw enrolment rate of Centrelink clients.\nApply the raw enrolment rates to Indigenous and non-Indigenous EEP benchmarks2 to yield draft\nIndigenous status enrolments. Calculate the factor to scale these to the overall enrolments used in the\nAEC’s published enrolment rates.\nApply the adjustment factor to the draft Indigenous status enrolments, then recalculate the enrolment\nrates against the EEP benchmarks.\nThis process can be done at the State level, though results will have lower reliability.\n\nNOTE: While this method avoids indirectly modelling Indigenous enrolment rates via geographic \nassociation, it does assume that any bias in Centrelink clients being enrolled is equal for \nIndigenous and non-Indigenous, and that there are no substantive Indigenous-status biases \ninherent in the Roll-to-Centrelink person matching. \n\n1 Acknowledge with appreciation the work of the former Electoral Integrity Unit and the IT Branch. \n2 Indigenous benchmarks use ABS projected adult populations, non-Indigenous are then the residual with published EEP. \n\nLS7888 Released Document No. 81919Released under the Freedom of Information Act 1982\n\n\n--- Page 2 ---\n\nConclusion and Results \nThe Centrelink client file with Indigenous indicator newly available to the AEC has presented an excellent \nopportunity, via matching to the Roll \n\n, to improve estimation of Indigenous franchise KPIs.  \n\nWhile the results are subject to a number of non-trivial assumptions, the more direct estimation methods lead \nto a higher likelihood of robust results. The figures should nevertheless still be regarded as indicative only. \n\nLS7888 Released Document No. 8191919Released under the Freedom of Information Act 1982\n\n\n--- Page 3 ---\n\nReleased under the Freedom of Information Act 1982\n\n\n--- Page 4 ---\n\nLS7888 Released Document No. 819Released under the Freedom of Information Act 1982\n\nProvide only the markdown formatted summary text.
