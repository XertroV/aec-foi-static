The intended impact includes improved internal relationships, understanding of work pressures, resource flexibility, enhanced strategic planning, and better agency understanding.\n\n**Relevance to FOI Request:**\nThis document directly responds to the FOI request for the AEC's 2023 \"Action Plan.\" While its title, \"2023 CENSUS ACTION PLAN,\" might suggest a plan for conducting the 2023 Census, the document itself clarifies it is an internal branch-level plan. Its focus is on enhancing the SDFB-NO branch's internal effectiveness, staff wellbeing, strategic thinking capabilities, and communication during the period coinciding with the 2023 Census, rather than detailing the operations of the census itself."

  "prompt": "Considering this document as part of an FOI request, summarize the document and its relevance to the FOI request in markdown format. FYI the overview of the FOI request is: An FOI request for the Australian Electoral Commission's (AEC) 2023 \"Action Plan\" yielded a two-page \"2023 CENSUS ACTION PLAN\" from the \"SDFB - NO\" branch. This internal strategic and operational document focuses on enhancing the branch's team effectiveness, staff wellbeing, strategic thinking, and communication during 2023. Key actions include implementing short secondments (Jan-Jun 2023) for improved knowledge and resource allocation, conducting monthly strategic thinking activities (from Jun 2023) to connect work to broader objectives, and fostering better agency understanding through guest speakers and internal stakeholder invitations to section meetings (from Jun 2023). Progress on these actions, for which Directors and \"AC\" are responsible, is to be discussed at monthly branch meetings and updated on physical posters. Notably, the \"2023 CENSUS ACTION PLAN\" title refers to an internal branch plan coinciding with the 2023 Census period, not a plan for conducting the census itself.\n\nDocument Text:\n\n\n\n--- Page 1 ---\n\nAYO\n\nae Australian Electoral Commission\n\ni\n\n \n\n2023 CENSUS ACTION PLAN\n\nCENSUS AREA ACTION\n\nIDENTIFY THE AREA THAT IS A PRIORITY\n\nLIST THE ACTION TO TAKE IN RESPONSE TO\nFOR THIS TEAM TO FOCUS ON THIS AREA\n\nTeam building — working\nin another section for\nshort periods of time to\nimprove knowledge and\nengagement across the\nbranch.\n\nWellbeing\n\nDesign and participate\nin a strategic thinking\nactivity one a month.\n\nStrategic thinking\n\nInvite guest speakers\nfrom relevant\nstakeholder areas to\npresent at section or\nbranch meetings, with a\nfocus on roles and\nresponsibilities.\n\nInvite AC and BPO to\nsection meetings.\n\nCommunication\n\nTIMEFRAME\n\nRECORD THE DATE BY WHICH\nTHIS ACTION NEEDS TO BE\nCOMPLETED\n\nSTATE WHO OR WHAT ROLE OR\nTEAM HAS RESPONSIBILITY FOR\n\nDecember 2023- | —\n\ndevelop a plan for\nshort secondments\nacross the branch.\nUndertake\nplacements from\nJanuary-June\n2023.\n\nJune 2023 — this to | Directors and AC\nbe an ongoing\nactivity throughout\n2023-24\n\nJune 2023 — this to | Directors and AC\nbe an ongoing\n\nactivity throughout\n\n2023-24\n\n \n\nDELIVERING THIS ACTION\n\nBRANCH/STATE: SDFB —- NO\n\nIMPACT a wet\n\nOUTLINE WHAT YOU ARE INTENDING TO ACHIEVE\nAS A RESULT OF THE SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION\nOF THIS ACTION\n\nBetterrelationships across | 0\n\nsections, better\nunderstanding of work\npressures across the branch,\nand the ability to shift\nresources to key areas of\nneed.\n\nStaff have the time and\nspace to think strategically\nabout their work, how it\nconnects into the agency and\nbroader government, and\ncan forward plan work that is\nstrategically significant.\n\nBetter understanding of\nagency functions and\nconnections to the work of\nthe branch.\n\n \n\n2023 Census Action Plan\n\nPage 1\n\n\n--- Page 2 ---\n\nay\n\nv\n\nHOW DO WE COMMUNICATE THIS AND KEEP IT ON OUR RADAR:\ne Discuss progress at each monthly branch meeting.\ne Update progress on Census Action Plan posters in each section.\n\n \n\n \n\n2023 Census Action Plan —\n\nProvide only the markdown formatted summary text.
