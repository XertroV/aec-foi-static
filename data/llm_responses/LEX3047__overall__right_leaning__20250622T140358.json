            "text": "The provided FOI documents illustrate the Australian Electoral Commission's (AEC) pervasive role in regulating political communications, primarily through enforcing authorization requirements for electoral advertisements. From a right-leaning perspective, several issues related to core conservative principles emerge:\n\n**Individual Liberty and Free Speech:** The documents reveal a broad application of regulations requiring authorization on political communications across a wide spectrum of entities, from established political parties and candidates to various grassroots and advocacy groups like \"Our Vote Our Community,\" \"Friends of the ABC,\" and \"Vote Tony Out.\" While the stated aim is transparency (\"voters know who is communicating electoral matter to them\"), the extensive reach of these requirements into social media pages and informal communications raises concerns about the potential chilling effect on individual liberty and free speech. These regulations impose a burden on individuals and small groups to identify themselves, which could be seen as an undue government intrusion into the spontaneous expression of political opinion.\n\n**Limited Government and Bureaucratic Overreach:** The sheer volume of complaints and the AEC's active correspondence to enforce authorization rules highlight a significant bureaucratic apparatus dedicated to policing political communication. This demonstrates an expansive role for government in an area traditionally considered within the realm of free association and speech. The complexity of determining what constitutes an \"advertisement\" or a \"disclosure entity\" (e.g., an entity spending over $13,800 on electoral communications) suggests an intricate regulatory framework. One complainant's cynical remark that the process exists \"just to make people feel like the rules are being upheld\" suggests a perception of bureaucratic inefficiency and potentially a process that is more about appearance than effective enforcement, hinting at overreach without proportionate impact.\n\n**Economic Efficiency and Fiscal Responsibility:** The regulatory burden imposed by these authorization requirements creates economic inefficiencies. Individuals, independent candidates, and small advocacy groups face compliance costs in understanding and adhering to complex rules regarding content authorization and disclosure thresholds. This can disproportionately affect less-resourced political actors, potentially stifling their ability to participate effectively in public discourse and creating an uneven playing field that favors well-funded entities with dedicated legal support. Furthermore, the extensive process of fielding, investigating, and responding to numerous complaints represents an expenditure of taxpayer funds. From a fiscal responsibility standpoint, this raises questions about whether the significant resources dedicated to regulating individual and small-group political expression yield a proportionate benefit to electoral integrity.\n\nIn summary, the documents reveal government actions and policies that, while ostensibly aimed at transparency in elections, lean towards increased regulation of political speech. This deviates from conservative principles advocating for individual liberty by burdening free expression, potentially expands the scope of government beyond limited core functions, and introduces economic inefficiencies through compliance costs and bureaucratic expenditure."

The AEC does not provide legal advice on how to comply with the \nElectoral Act, however, I offer the following observations in relation to the authorisation requirements in the \nAct.  The Electoral Backgrounder: Electoral communications and authorisation requirements on the AEC website \nprovides more information.  \n\nThe Electoral Act requires the communication of certain electoral matters to be authorised.  ‘Electoral matter’ is \ndefined in section 4AA(1) of the Electoral Act to be a matter communicated or intended to be communicated for the \ndominant purpose of influencing the way electors vote in a federal election. \n\nA communication containing electoral matter must be authorised if it is: \n\n  a paid electoral advertisement, or \n\n  a sticker, fridge magnet, leaflet, flyer, pamphlet, notice, poster or how-to-vote card, or \n\n  a matter communicated by or on behalf of a disclosure entity (e.g. a candidate, Senator or Member of the \nHouse of Representatives, registered political party, an associated entity or other person or group who is \nrequired to submit a return under Part XX of the Electoral Act). \n\nIt is an offence under section 321D(5) of the Electoral Act to make these types of electoral communications without \nproper authorisation.   \n\nThe AEC has checked the Vote Tony Out campaign sites and identified the following issues. \n\nAuthorisation of Vote Tony Out stickers \n\nThe stickers for sale on the Vote Tony Out website contain electoral matter that requires authorisation under \nsection 321D(1)(b) of the Electoral Act.  Can you please stop selling and distributing the unauthorised stickers.  The \nother merchandise for sale on the website does not need to be authorised. \n\nAuthorisation of Vote Tony Out Facebook page \n\nThe Vote Tony Out Facebook page is currently running paid advertising promoting the Vote Tony Out rally on \n5 May.  This electoral advertising needs to be authorised or have a link to an authorised Facebook page.  The \nauthorisation of a social media site only needs the name and city of the person authorising the site.  The \nauthorisation can be added to the “About” section in a Facebook page. \n\nAuthorisation of Vote Tony Out website \n\n1\n\n47F47F\n\n\n--- Page 2 ---\n\nI note you have an authorisation on the Mail chimp webpage supporting the Vote Tony Out website.  To be prudent \nI recommend adding this authorisation to the bottom of the Vote Tony Out website (alongside the copyright notice) \nand/or on the website “About” page. \n\nWhether Vote Tony Out is or will become a third party (disclosure entity) for the purpose of the Electoral Act \n\nAs noted above a disclosure entity must authorise all electoral communications.  A ‘disclosure entity’ is defined in \nsection 321B of the Electoral Act to include a person or entity who will incur electoral expenditure during a financial \nyear above the disclosure threshold (currently $13,800). \n\nIf you think you will spend more than $13,8000 this financial year on electoral communications then you will need to \nprovide a disclosure return to the AEC under Part XX of the Electoral Act and also must authorise all your electoral \ncommunications.  There are also other obligations on third parties in the Electoral Act, such as restrictions on \nreceiving foreign donations.  \n\nActions \n\nCan you please: \n\n  Stop the sale and distribution of unauthorised Vote Tony Out stickers from the Vote Tony Out website.  If \n\nyou want to sell more stickers, the stickers will need to have an authorisation added. \n\n  Authorise any paid electoral advertising on social media or elsewhere \n\n  Authorise the Vote Tony Out Facebook page and website (and if the Vote Tony Out Twitter site and \n\nInstagram page are also running paid electoral advertising or you think you will become a disclosure entity \nfor the purpose of the Electoral Act, these sites should also include an authorisation)  \n\nCan you please take this action by COB Monday 29 April and advise the AEC of this action. \n\nYours sincerely \n\n | Principal Government Lawyer \n\nElectoral Authorisation Section | Legal & Procurement Branch \nAustralian Electoral Commission \nT: \n\n2\n\n47FSection 47F\n\n\n\n--- Page 1 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 2 ---\n\nFrom: \n<\nSent: Saturday, 20 April 2019 12:45 PM \nTo: \n <\nSubject: Authorisation \nImportance: High \n\n@nsw.liberal.org.au>  \n\n@aec.gov.au> \n\nDear \n\nI draw to your attention the website www.votetonyout.com which is selling a range of merchandise in the context of \nthe forthcoming federal election. \n\nIn particular, the merchandise features messages calling for voters to vote out the Liberal candidate for Warringah, \nTony Abbott, and alternatively supporting the independent candidate, Zali Steggall. \n\nI note that neither the website, nor the merchandise being sold through the website (that requires authorisation), \ncontains the required particulars in accordance with Part XXA of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 (‘the Act’).   \n\nAccording to a search of ASIC records of the ABN listed on the website \nOUT was registered on 5/04/2019 to a \n\n of \n\n the business VOTE TONY \n\n. \n\nI would ask that the AEC investigates this breach of the Act and take appropriate action if warranted. \n\nRegards, \n\nMessage protected by MailGuard: e-mail anti-virus, anti-spam and content filtering. \nhttp://www.mailguard.com.au/mg \n\nClassified by \n\nFor Official Use Only \n\n@aec.gov.au on 21/04/2019 12:53:21 PM \n\n2\n\n47F47F47F47F47F47F47F47F47F47F\n\n\n\n--- Page 1 ---\n\nFrom:\nSent:\nTo:\nSubject:\n\nAttachments:\n\nM\n\nm  \n\nm \n\nFriday, 17 May 2019 2:40 PM\nLegal Services Mailbox\n[COMPLAINT Political advertising] \n[SEC=UNCLASSIFIED]\n[Attachment 01]\n\nWWW* \n\n.jpg; [Attachment 02]-\n\njpg\n\nComplaint \n\nCategory \n\nPolitical advertising \n\nPrimary Details \n\nGiven name(s): \nSurname: \nOrganisation: \nEmail: \nPhone number: \n\nElectoral division: \n\nComplaint Details \n\nThe Facebook page: https://www.facebook.com/AgentsintheirCommunity/ is running political ads \nwithout authorisation. \n\nExpected Outcome \n\nAs per my last complaint, I expect sweet fuck all to occur.

These obligations are contained in sections 321D(1) and (5) of the Electoral Act. The definition of \n‘disclosure entity’ includes, amongst others, a senator or member of the House of Representatives, a person who is \na candidate in an election or by-election, or a person who was a candidate in an election or by-election of a member \nof the House of Representatives in the previous 4 years, or an election of Senators for a State or Territory in the \nprevious 7 years.  \n\nWe note that you stood as a candidate in the division of Wills in the 2016 federal election and as such, all \ncommunications of electoral matter by, or on behalf of, yourself are required by the Electoral Act to include an \nauthorisation. We also note that some of your posts are currently being sponsored as advertisements which also \nrequire an authorisation. \n\nRelevantly for websites and social media, the authorisation must include: \n\n(a) the name of the person who either approved the content of the electoral matter before it was \n\ncommunicated, or otherwise the person that communicated the electoral matter; and \n\n(b) the relevant town or city of the person. \n\nMore information on the authorisation requirements is in the Electoral Backgrounder on the AEC website. If you \nrequire clarification, the AEC recommends you seek independent legal advice. \n\nCan you please address these omissions by adding the required authorisation to the ‘About’ section of the \n\n Thinker Politician & Architect to the Very Rich & Worthy’ \nFacebook pages by COB this Wednesday 1 May 2019 and send a reply email to authorisationsection@aec.gov.au \nonce this is done? \n\n for WILLS’ and \n\n1\n\n47F47F47F47F47F47F\n\n\n--- Page 2 ---\n\nFailure to authorise electoral communications where required can result in a penalty of up to $25,200. One further \npoint to note on the authorisation of electoral matter; whilst the Electoral Act enables the AEC to seek an injunction \nagainst an electoral communication that does not meet the requirements in the Electoral Act, now that the federal \nelection has been called, the Electoral Act enables other persons who have been nominated as candidates to also \nseek an injunction against any unauthorised electoral communications. \n\nYours sincerely \n\n | Senior Lawyer  \n\nElectoral Authorisation Section | Legal & Procurement Branch \nAustralian Electoral Commission \nT: \n\n2\n\n47F47F\n\n\n\n--- Page 1 ---\n\nFrom:\nSent:\nTo:\nSubject:\n\nTuesday, 23 April 2019 12:10 AM\nLegal Services Mailbox\n[COMPLAINT Political advertising] \n[SEC=UNCLASSIFIED]\n\n *WWW* \n\nComplaint \n\nCategory \n\nPolitical advertising \n\nPrimary Details \n\nGiven name(s): \nSurname: \nOrganisation: \nEmail: \nPhone number: \n\nElectoral division: \n\nHolt \n\nComplaint Details \n\nThe Facebook page \n\n for WILLS https://www.facebook.com/pg/\n\nfor-WILLS-2337394036272646/ carries no authorisation or contact details and is making \n\nspecific political commentary.
