This deviation could potentially alter election outcomes.\n*   **Bulk Exclusion Omission:** The AEC has not implemented bulk exclusions (Electoral Act Section 273 (13A)) since 2013, under the presumed, but mistaken, belief that it does not affect the count. The report demonstrates that bulk exclusions can, in fact, change election outcomes due to altered elimination order and rounding effects. The Act's language on bulk exclusion is ambiguous regarding its mandatory application.\n*   **Ambiguity in Count Termination:** The Electoral Act lacks clarity on when the count terminates, particularly concerning the simultaneous application of subsections 273 (17) (electing the higher of two remaining candidates for the last seat) and (18) (electing remaining candidates when seats equal continuing candidates). This ambiguity can affect who wins the last seat or the order in which candidates are declared elected.\n\n**Recommendations:**\nThe report proposes several legislative and procedural changes:\n*   Correct the AEC's official code to comply with legislated tie-breaking rules, or alternatively, publish the code and amend the legislation to match it.\n*   Formalize the policy of favoring candidates lower on the ballot for otherwise unresolved ties.\n*   Remove bulk exclusion provisions from the Electoral Act to eliminate complexity and ambiguity.\n*   Clarify or remove subsection 273 (17) to ensure it applies consistently (preferably after all transfers are completed, aligning with AEC's current practice).\n*   Clarify when subsection 273 (18) applies.\n*   Implement a rigorous statistical audit of digitized preference data files against paper ballots to ensure accuracy and transparency.\n\n**Relevance to FOI Request:**\nThis document is the \"subsequent 2021 report by Conway and Teague\" directly referenced in the FOI request overview. It provides the detailed findings concerning \"accuracy, methodology, and identified issues with the Australian Electoral Commission's (AEC) Senate election counting algorithm and associated scrutiny processes.\" Specifically, it substantiates the FOI request's points regarding:\n*   The AEC's software using tie-breaking rules inconsistent with the Electoral Act.\n*   The non-implementation of bulk exclusions and their potential to alter outcomes.\n*   Ambiguities in the Electoral Act concerning the count's termination.\n*   It details the proposed \"legislative and procedural recommendations,\" including publishing the AEC's code, correcting tie-breaking, and clarifying statutory definitions, which the AEC subsequently responded to. As such, it is central to understanding the discrepancies investigated by the FOI request."

Do not include any conversational filler or preamble.To aid you, the overview of the FOI request is: [REQUEST OVERVIEW START] This FOI request sought information concerning the accuracy, methodology, and identified issues with the Australian Electoral Commission's (AEC) Senate election counting algorithm and associated scrutiny processes. While early independent tests (2016-2017) found no issues replicating the AEC's 2013 WA Senate count, a subsequent 2021 report by Conway and Teague identified significant discrepancies. This report detailed that the AEC's software used tie-breaking rules inconsistent with the Electoral Act, noted the non-implementation of bulk exclusions (which can alter outcomes), and highlighted ambiguities in the Electoral Act concerning the count's termination. The report proposed various legislative and procedural recommendations, including publishing the AEC's code, correcting tie-breaking, and clarifying statutory definitions, to which the AEC subsequently responded.\n [REQUEST OVERVIEW END] \n\n--- MAIN DOCUMENT TEXT START ---\n\n\n\n--- Page 1 ---\n\nCorrections to the AEC’s counting code, and recommended\namendments to the Electoral Act, for Senate Counting &\nScrutiny\n\nDr Andrew Conway ∗\n\nA/Prof Vanessa Teague†\nThinking Cybersecurity Pty. Ltd.\n& Australian National University\nvanessa.teague@anu.edu.au\n\nAugust 31, 2021\n\nAbstract\n\nThis report summarises our recommendations for technical changes to those parts of the\nElectoral Act that regulate the Senate Counting and Scrutiny. We show, and explain how\nto correct, a point on which the AEC’s current counting software does not correspond to the\nrequirements of the legislation. As far as we know, this has so far not caused the wrong\npeople to be elected. We also identify ambiguities in the legislation, which might leave the\nresult undeﬁned. These would be better resolved before the election when they are politically\nneutral.\n\nAlthough the digitization process is separate from the counting stage, our results bolster the\nargument for an independent audit of the paper ballots every Senate election, to demonstrate\nto scrutineers that the ballot-digitization process is accurate, or to allow for any errors to be\nidentiﬁed and corrected.\n\n1 Introduction\n\nThe Australian Senate count has several distinct phases:\n\n• ﬁrst preferences are manually counted,\n\n• paper ballots are imaged at a counting centre,\n\n• the images are digitized, using a combined human and automated process,\n\n• the digitized preferences are electronically counted, in order to establish who won a seat.\n\nThis report focuses on the last step. We ﬁnd an example in which the AEC’s oﬃcial counting\nsoftware deviates from the requirements of the Electoral Act, and two examples of changes of\ninterpretation. We then provide simple examples to demonstrate that these could, in principle,\nalter election results, though it does not seem to have done so yet. We then detail where either\nthe code needs to be corrected to conform to the Electoral Act, or where the Electoral Act could\nbe amended to match what we know of the code.\n\nThe error concerns the resolution of 3-way ties for the candidate with the lowest tally. We ﬁnd\nan example from the 2016 WA Senate election, in which the AEC’s software applied the wrong\ntiebreaking rule, resulting in candidates being excluded in the wrong order. This is described in\nSection 2.\n\nThe second issue is that the AEC has not implemented bulk exclusion (Section 13A). Contrary\nto common belief (and probably contrary to the intentions of the authors of the Electoral Act),\nbulk exclusion can alter who wins a seat. The Act is hard to interpret on whether bulk elimination\nis compulsory. This is detailed in Section 3, together with examples to show why bulk exclusion\ncan alter the election outcome. We recommend that bulk exclusion be deleted from the Electoral\nAct, matching the AEC’s current practice.\n\n∗Andrew Conway is a member of the Secular Party.\n†Vanessa Teague is an advisory board member of Veriﬁed Voting, a non-governmental US organization working\n\ntoward accuracy, integrity and veriﬁability of elections.\n\n1\n\n\n--- Page 2 ---\n\nAs a third issue, the Electoral Act does not clearly deﬁne when the count ends, which is relevant\nbecause two termination conditions may apply simultaneously. This can leave ambiguity over who\nwins the last seat (under subsection (17)) and can alter the order in which candidates are considered\nto have been elected (under subsection 18). Suggested amendments are described in Section 4.\n\n1.1 Prior work\n\nThese results are similar to our prior discoveries of errors in the NSW [CBNT17] and ACT [CT]\nvote counts. The tiebreaking problems are similar to those identiﬁed by Wen [Wen10]. Most of\nour suggestions for simpliﬁcations are aligned with Gor´e and Lebedeva [GL16], whose suggestions\nfor further improvements we also support.\n\nOther open-source STV counting programs include Grahame Bowland’s Dividebatur1 and its\nsuccessor Dividebatur22, Lee Yingtong Li’s OpenTally3, and Milad Ghale’s formally veriﬁed STV4.\nDividebatur2 is speciﬁcally implemented for the exact Senate rules, and performs tiebreaking\ncorrectly, but does not implement bulk exclusion.\n\nWe have written extensively in the past about the importance of auditing the digitization\nprocess [BCT+19]. Although it is not directly relevant to this report, the importance of double-\nchecking electronic processes is emphasised, so we reiterate that recommendation here:\n\nRecommendation 1. When the preference data ﬁles for Senate votes are published, there should\nbe a rigorous statistical audit to check that they accurately reﬂect the paper ballots. This should be\nconducted in a way that allows Scrutineers to check both the algorithms and the data.\n\nThe rest of this report details speciﬁc issues in the count.\n\n1.2 Summary and purpose of this report\n\nWe have identiﬁed one case in which the AEC’s software is diﬀerent from the legislated rules, one\nin which it could be debated, and one in which the Electoral Act is ambiguous. These all need to\nbe clariﬁed before they make a diﬀerence to an election outcome.\n\nThe Senate count, like other Single Transferable Vote legislation, is highly complex and de-\npendent on a number of rather arbitrary choices. The ambiguity is the problem—almost any\nclariﬁcation deﬁned in advance would suﬃce, as long as it was unambiguous and exactly followed\nby the AEC. For example, if the AEC agreed to publish its source code, the legislation could be\namended to reﬂect it. (Although we would not generally recommend making legislation in this\nway, it would be harmless for the examples in this report.)\n\nEach section of this report includes speciﬁc recommendations for resolving the diﬀerences or\n\nclarifying the rules.\n\nOur aim in this report is to contribute to improving electoral legislation and process to achieve\nelection results that are unambiguous and publicly veriﬁable. Everyone makes mistakes, and there\nis no reason that occasional errors should undermine public trust in the election, if there is a good\nprocess for checking and correcting the count. Improving processes to produce clear evidence of\nan accurate election outcome is of great beneﬁt for public trust in Australian election outcomes.\n\nWe encourage everyone to examine and double-check our results. Our code and examples are\n\navailable at https://github.com/AndrewConway/ConcreteSTV\n\n2 Three way ties: error in the WA 2016 Senate count\n\nWhen the lowest standing candidate is to be excluded, and there is a tie, there is an explicit rule\nfor resolving it:\n\nElectoral Act, Section 273 31(b)\n\n...if 2 or more continuing candidates have the same number of votes, those candidates\nshall stand in the poll in the order of the relative number of votes of each of those\ncandidates at the last count at which each of them had a diﬀerent number of votes,\n[our emphasis] with the continuing candidate with the greater or greatest number of\nvotes at that count standing higher in the poll and the continuing candidate with the\nfewer or fewest number of votes at that count standing lower in the poll, but if there\n\n1https://github.com/grahame/dividebatur\n2https://github.com/grahame/dividebatur2\n3https://yingtongli.me/git/OpenTally/\n4https://github.com/MiladKetabGhale/STV-Counting-ProtocolVerification\n\n2\n\n\n--- Page 3 ---\n\nCount HERCOCK, Marion FARGHER, Sara HENG, Henry\n57\n63\n63\n63\n65\n65\n65\n66\n66\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5..9\n10,11\n12..15\n16..41\n42..48\n\n54\n57\n60\n61\n63\n64\n65\n66\n66\n\n61\n64\n65\n65\n65\n65\n65\n65\n66\n\nTable 1: Tiebreaking in the ﬁrst 2016 WA Senate special election. Hercock was excluded, though\nFargher had the lowest tally when each of the three candidates’ tallies were diﬀerent (Count 4).\n\nhas been no such count the Australian Electoral Oﬃcer for the State shall determine\nthe order of standing of those candidates in the poll.\n\nThere are very similar clauses in subsections (22) and (22b) for order of election and surplus\n\ndistribution tie resolution.\n\nIn the ﬁrst WA 2016 Senate special count,5 (conducted on 7 March 2017, after Rod Cullerton\nwas removed), this situation arose at Count 48, where there was a three-way tie for exclusion:\nM. Hercock, S. Fargher and H Heng all had 66 votes. Their tallies are shown in Table 1. The\nlast count at which each of them had a diﬀerent number of votes was Count 4, with 65, 61 and\n63 respectively. Our reading of the legislation is that S. Fargher should therefore be excluded at\nCount 48.\n\nIn the oﬃcial count, the AEC excluded M. Hercock instead. There is a natural argument for\nthis—at count 41 M. Hercock had a lower tally than either of the others, and there is no reason\nother than the legislation that this would not be a reasonable basis for tie resolution. Indeed, this\napproach has the advantage of resolving more situations than the “each of them had a diﬀerent\nnumber” rule. It would be a reasonable thing to legislate, but it is not what the Electoral Act\ncurrently requires.\n\nOf course, diﬀerent methods of resolving who is excluded can easily change the outcome of the\nelection. As a very simple example of how this could aﬀect who is elected, imagine that the number\nof vacancies was equal to the number of candidates remaining after the candidate in question was\nexcluded. For this reason it is essential that the legislation and the oﬃcial code be aligned.\n\nRecommendation 2. Either:\n\n• Correct the AEC’s oﬃcial code to follow the legislation for tie resolution, or\n\n• Ask the AEC to publish the oﬃcial code, including its tiebreaking rules, and amend the\n\nlegislation to match it.\n\nIt is also worth pointing out that sometimes the prior counts do not resolve the tie, and the\nAustralian Electoral Oﬃcer is called upon to choose an order. In 2016 and 2019, it appears that all\nsuch decisions favoured candidates according to their position on the ballot, with lower candidates\nbetter favoured. This seems fair as the donkey vote otherwise favours higher candidates. This\nseems like an excellent policy which we fully endorse, and would suggest making part of the act.\n\nRecommendation 3. Formalize as legislation the apparent policy to, in the case of otherwise\nunresolved ties, favour candidates lower on the ballot.\n\n3 Bulk Exclusions: omission in the 2016 and 2019 counts\n\nSection 273 subsection (13A) describes a bulk exclusion where multiple candidates are excluded\ntogether. It is commonly believed (and probably intended) that this can never alter the election\noutcome. In this section we show that that assumption is mistaken.\n\nThe AEC does not appear to have implemented bulk exclusions since 2013, presumably in the\nmistaken belief that it cannot not alter the count. It is unclear whether bulk exclusion is at the\nAEC’s discretion or not. The Electoral Act Section 273 (13) states:\n\n5The oﬃcial Distribution of Preferences is at https://www.aec.gov.au/Elections/federal_elections/2016/\n\nfiles/wa-senate-dist-prefs-2016fe-special-count-07032017.pdf\n\n3\n\n\n--- Page 4 ---\n\n(13) Where, after the counting of ﬁrst preference votes or the transfer of surplus votes\n(if any) of elected candidates, no candidate has, or fewer than the number of candidates\nrequired to be elected have, received a number of votes equal to the quota:\n\n(a) the candidate who stands lowest in the poll must be excluded; or\n\n(b) if a bulk exclusion of candidates may be eﬀected under subsection (13A), those\n\ncandidates must be excluded;\n\nThe logic seems unclear here—we are not lawyers and cannot say with conﬁdence whether “those\ncandidates must be excluded” would apply whenever (13A) permits it, but that would be one\nplausible interpretation.\n\nIn this section we provide two simple examples to show that, in two diﬀerent ways, bulk\nexclusion can alter the outcome. The ﬁrst concerns the order of eliminations, the second is due to\nrounding. In each case, diﬀerent people are elected depending on whether the bulk exclusion rule\nis applied.\n\n3.1 Bulk Exclusions and order of elimination\n\nSubsection 13A (d) (i) does not have a clause requiring candidate C to satisfy a similar condition\nto 13A (b) (ii). This means that bulk exclusions can change the order of elimination. This can\nreadily change the outcome of an election. A simple example is shown here with 6 vacancies, and\nvotes as described in the table below:\n\nPreference List Occurrences\nL1, L2, W1, W3\nL2\nL3, L2, W1, W3\nL4, W1, W2\nL5, W4\nL5, W5\nL5, W6\nL5, W7\nL5\nW7\nW6\nW5\nW4\nW3\nW2\nW2, W4\nW2, W5\nW2, W6\nW1\n\n2\n3\n4\n6\n1\n2\n3\n4\n10\n400\n400\n400\n400\n400\n388\n6\n4\n2\n400\n\nUsing the rules as applied by the AEC in 2013, as best we can reverse engineer, would result\n\nin the distribution of preferences shown in table 2, with bulk exclusion occurring on count 1:\n\nHowever, using the rules that seem to have been applied by the AEC in 2016, ignoring bulk ex-\nclusions, the order of elimination changes, and candidate W3 is elected instead of W2. Furthermore\nthe order of election of candidates W4, W5, W6 and W7 is reversed, as shown in table 3\n\nCuriously enough, using the rules apparently applied by the AEC in 2019, the same candidates\n\nare elected, but in a diﬀerent order; see section 4.2.\n\n3.2 Bulk Exclusions and rounding\n\nIt is more obvious that Bulk Exclusions can change rounding, and this can change the result of\nthe election. Rounding may seem like a small eﬀect, but in 2016 Tasmania, there were 285 votes\nlost due to rounding, and the margin between the last two candidates was 143 votes.\n\nHere is a very simple demonstration of how the presence or absence of bulk exclusion can change\n\nrounding and thus who is elected in a 2 vacancy election.\n\n4\n\n\n--- Page 5 ---\n\nCount W1 W2 W3 W4 W5 W6 W7\n400\n400\n\n400\n\n400\n\n400\n\n400\n\nExclude L1, L2\n\n400\n\n400\n\n400\n\n400\n\n400\n\n400\n\n1\n400\n2 +2\n402\n3 +4\n406\n\nExclude L3\n4\nExclude L4\n5\nExclude L5\n6\nExclude W3\n\n400\n+6\n406\n\n400\n\n406 (cid:8)(cid:8)(cid:72)(cid:72)400\n−400\n0\n\n406\n\n406\n\n406\n\n406\n\n400\n\n400\n\n400\n\n400\n\n400\n\n400\n\n400\n\n400\n400\n+1 +2 +3 +4\n404\n401\n\n403\n\n402\n\n401\n\n402\n\n403\n\n404\n\nL1\n(cid:1)(cid:65)2\n\nL2\n(cid:1)(cid:65)3\n−2 −3\n0\n\n0\n\nL3\n4\n\n(cid:1)(cid:65)4\n−4\n0\n\nL5\n20\n\n20\n\n20\n\nL4\n6\n\n6\n\n(cid:1)(cid:65)6\n−6\n\n0 (cid:26)(cid:26)(cid:90)(cid:90)20\n−20\n0\n\nExh.

The ambiguity over\nwhether or not to use it could result in a contested election outcome that is diﬃcult or impossible\nto resolve. The best way to avoid this is to remove bulk exclusion from the Act.\n\nRecommendation 4. Remove Bulk Exclusion from the Act. This includes subsections (13A),\n(13B), (13C), portions of (13AA), and several deﬁnitions in (29).\n\n6\n\n\n--- Page 7 ---\n\n4 Ambiguity in the Act: termination of the count\n\nThere are three diﬀerent ways a candidate can be elected:\n\n• by attaining a quota,\n\n• by being the higher of the two continuing candidates when there is exactly one unﬁlled seat\n\n(Subsection (17)).\n\n• by being a continuing candidate when the number of unﬁlled seats equals the number of\n\ncontinuing candidates, (subsection (18))\n\nThe Act does not explicitly deﬁne when the distribution of preferences ends—in particular, it\nis unclear when subsections (17) or (18) apply. Subsection (18) aﬀects only order, not who gets\nelected. However, subsection (17) can aﬀect who wins.\n\nCommonwealth Electoral Act 1918, Section 273, (17)\n\nIn respect of the last vacancy for which two continuing candidates remain, the con-\ntinuing candidate who has the larger number of votes shall be elected notwithstanding\nthat that number is below the quota, and if those candidates have an equal number of\nvotes the Australian Electoral Oﬃcer for the State shall have a casting vote but shall\nnot otherwise vote at the election.\n\nUnlike a computer program, which (usually) has an implicit but well-deﬁned sequence of exe-\ncution steps, the Electoral Act simply lists a number of things that could happen (in subsections\n(9) through (18)) but does not specify which should be chosen when the conditions for two or more\nhave been met.\n\nAs a speciﬁc example, suppose one candidate (A) attains a quota (and hence a seat), leaving\ntwo other candidates, B and C, competing for a single last seat. Should subsection (17) apply\nimmediately, electing whichever of B and C has a larger total, or should A’s surplus be distributed\nﬁrst? The legislation is not clear.\n\nSubsection (14) states\n\n(14) Any continuing candidate who has received a number of votes equal to or\ngreater than the quota on the completion of a transfer under subsection (13) or (15)\nof ballot papers of an excluded candidate or candidates, as the case may be, shall be\nelected, and, unless all the vacancies have been ﬁlled, the surplus votes (if any) of the\ncandidate so elected shall be transferred...\n\nThe question is whether, “all the vacancies have been ﬁlled,” because (17) applies immediately,\nor instead (17) should not be applied until after this transfer has been completed. A similar\nambiguity arises over exclusions (subsection (15)): when a candidate is excluded, should subsection\n(17) apply immediately, or should the excluded candidate’s preferences be distributed ﬁrst?\n\nThese decisions could aﬀect who wins, because preference distribution could alter the relative\n\nrankings of the two continuing candidates.\n\n4.1 Practical examples of when subsection (17) can alter the election\n\noutcome\n\nIn practice, for all the examples we could ﬁnd, the AEC seems to apply (17) only after all transfers\nhave been completed. This seems like the right thing to do, and we believe the legislation should\nbe amended to reﬂect (what seems to be) the AEC’s practice. Indeed, subsection (17) could simply\nbe removed—it is unnecessary because the exclusion of the lower candidate immediately causes\nsubsection (18) to apply (one candidate and one seat remaining).\n\nResolving the ambiguity is important because this case arises frequently in practice. For exam-\nple, consider the special count of the 2016 South Australian Senate votes, conducted in 2017 after\nthe removal of Bob Day.6 The last steps are summarised in Table 6. At the end of Count 453, there\nare three remaining candidates: McEwen (ALP), Gichuhi (FFP), and Burgess (ON). Burgess has\nthe least votes and is excluded, leaving only two candidates. If subsection (17) were applied imme-\ndiately, McEwen would win (with the higher tally). But after all the preferences are distributed,\nGichuhi wins. Similar examples arose in 2013 in NSW, Vic, WA and Tasmania.\n\n6https://www.aec.gov.au/Elections/Federal_Elections/2016/files/sa-senate-dist-prefs-2016fe-special-count-13042017.\n\npdf\n\n7\n\n\n--- Page 8 ---\n\nCount McEWEN GICHUHI BURGESS\n\n453\nSurplus KAKOSCHKE-MOORE\n454–465\nExclude BURGESS\n\n54099\n\n52482\n\n(cid:24)(cid:24)(cid:24)(cid:88)(cid:88)(cid:88)46684\n\n65841\n\n69442\n\n0\n\nTable 6: The last steps of the 2016 South Australian Senate special election count, conducted in\n2017.

Elected candidates are\ncolored purple once they have a quota.\n\nRecommendation 5. Remove subsection (17), or clarify that it applies only after all papers from\nsurplus distributions and exclusions are transferred (which seems to be the AEC’s current practice).\n\n4.2 Subsection 18\n\nSubsection (18) does not aﬀect who wins, but may aﬀect their order—we do not know whether\nthis matters in any politically-relevant way.\n\nIn 2016, the AEC seemed to apply section 18 after ﬁnishing started exclusions and any surplus\ndistributions that may thereby arise. For example, in the Queensland 2016 election, at count 830,\ncandidate R. McGarvie was excluded, leaving 2 candidates and 2 seats. The exclusion was carried\nout in full (11 counts), and C Ketter was discovered to have a quota, leaving 1 candidate (M\nRoberts) and 1 vacancy. This candidate was not elected until count 841, when C Ketter’s surplus\nwas distributed. Similar events happened in Victoria (count 814), and NSW (count 1054). A\ndiﬀerent thing occurred in WA 2016 (with R. Cullerton excluded) where on count 535 K. Muir was\nexcluded, leaving 2 candidates and 2 seats. The ﬁrst step of the exclusion was performed, at the\nend of which the remaining 2 candidates were both declared elected. Regardless, the transfer of\nvotes for the ﬁrst step of exclusion was always performed.\n\nIn 2019 the rules seemed to change and the AEC applied subsection (18) immediately after\nidentiﬁcation of a candidate to be excluded, before transferring any votes. In 2019 NSW, count\n429, K. McCulloch is excluded. This leaves 2 candidates, 2 vacancies. The preference distribution\nwas aborted and no ballots were transferred in this count.\n\nRecommendation 6. Clarify when subsection (18) applies.\n\nThe example used in Section 3.1 can be applied using the rules the AEC appeared to have used\nin 2019, aborting an exclusion after identiﬁcation of the candidate to be excluded. This produces\nyet another diﬀerent outcome from the same votes shown in table 7. This time only the order of\nelection changes, with the order of election of candidates W4, W5, W6 and W7 being reversed.\n\n8\n\n\n--- Page 9 ---\n\n5 Conclusion\n\nEveryone makes mistakes, and all software has bugs and security vulnerabilities.7 For election\nsoftware, the crucial thing is not to make the software perfect (which is impossible) but to ensure\nan open and transparent process that allows the software, and its results, to be scrutinised and\ndouble-checked. It is a good thing when errors and vulnerabilities are found and ﬁxed.\n\nWe have found one error (in the implementation of tiebreaking) in the AEC’s oﬃcial Senate\ncounting software. This needs to be corrected before the next election, and we would be happy to\nhelp patch it if the source code is made openly available. Alternatively, the Electoral Act could be\namended to match the AEC’s current algorithm—it does not really matter how ties are broken,\nas long as the algorithm is speciﬁed in advance. Modifying the Electoral Act to match the current\nalgorithm would also be aided by opening the source code.\n\nThe same applies to the other two ambiguities we identiﬁed in the Electoral Act: bulk exclusion\nand the order of application of subsection (17). The legislation is unclear, and needs to be clariﬁed,\neither to match the AEC’s current code (if it is made available) or independently. A system that\nallows discretion over ambiguous rules, or runs a count diﬀerent from the speciﬁed rules, may result\nin disputes at election time that are diﬃcult or impossible to resolve.\n\nThe purpose of this report is to avoid this outcome, by providing speciﬁc directions on correcting\nthe AEC’s code (Section 2), realigning the AEC’s code with the unclear legislation (Section 3),\nand resolving ambiguitites in the legislation (Section 4). This should give very high conﬁdence\nthat the counting software is accurate and produces the unique outcome deﬁned by legislation.\n\nIt is easy to double-check the Senate counting software, because the software’s inputs (votes)\nand outputs (distributions of preferences) are both publicly available. This allows for the open\npublic double-checking that is critical to democracy. (Of course it does not guarantee that all such\nproblems will be found before they aﬀect a count.) It is very helpful that the AEC makes this\ninformation publicly available.\n\nBy contrast, it is not possible to double-check—so as to ﬁnd and ﬁx errors in—the software that\nconverts paper ballots to digitized preferences. This leaves the AEC without a way of providing\nevidence of an accurate election outcome. A statistical audit of randomly-chosen paper ballots,\nin the presence of scrutineers, would allow the digitized preferences to be double-checked against\ntheir paper originals. This would give onlookers a chance to ﬁnd and ﬁx problems, or to see that\nthere was good evidence that the number of discrepancies was small.\n\n6 Summary of Recommendations\n\nRecommendation 1. When the preference data ﬁles for Senate votes are published, there should\nbe a rigorous statistical audit to check that they accurately reﬂect the paper ballots. This should be\nconducted in a way that allows Scrutineers to check both the algorithms and the data.\n\nRecommendation 2. Either:\n\n• Correct the AEC’s oﬃcial code to follow the legislation for tie resolution, or\n\n• Ask the AEC to publish the oﬃcial code, including its tiebreaking rules, and amend the\n\nlegislation to match it.\n\nRecommendation 3. Formalize as legislation the apparent policy to, in the case of otherwise\nunresolved ties, favour candidates lower on the ballot.\n\nRecommendation 4. Remove Bulk Exclusion from the Act. This includes subsections (13A),\n(13B), (13C), portions of (13AA), and several deﬁnitions in (29).\n\nRecommendation 5. Remove subsection (17), or clarify that it applies only after all papers from\nsurplus distributions and exclusions are transferred (which seems to be the AEC’s current practice).\n\nRecommendation 6. Clarify when subsection (18) applies.\n\n7Even our software. We found the AEC tiebreaking error when we were re-implementing our version of the\n\nSenate count and noticed we had made the same mistake.\n\n9\n\n\n--- Page 10 ---\n\nReferences\n\n[BCT+19] Michelle Blom, Chris Culnane, Vanessa Teague, Damjan Vukcevic, Andrew Conway,\nRajeev Gor´e, and Peter Stuckey.
