While statistically based, these models were noted for poor data fit and produced \"alarmingly low\" and potentially \"worst case\" enrolment and turnout rates.\n\nThe document then details a significant methodological shift in 2017. The AEC began leveraging person-level Centrelink data, which includes an Indigenous indicator, through its Annual Roll Integrity Review (ARIR). Although Centrelink data covers only about half of the electoral roll, this direct matching process allowed the AEC for the first time to identify over 6 million enrolled persons with explicit Indigenous status. The new method calculates Indigenous enrolment rates by:\n1.  Determining the enrolment proportion for Centrelink clients with identified Indigenous/non-Indigenous status.\n2.  Calculating an adjustment factor by comparing the overall actual AEC enrolment rate with the Centrelink-based rate.\n3.  Applying this factor to raw Centrelink-based Indigenous and non-Indigenous enrolment rates.\n\nWhile acknowledging that this new method still relies on \"courageous assumptions\" (e.g., assuming no bias in Centrelink client enrolment or the Roll-to-Centrelink matching process), it is presented as a \"more direct,\" \"improved approach\" leading to a \"higher likelihood of robust results\" compared to the previous indirect modelling. The results are still considered indicative.\n\n### Relevance to FOI Request LS7888\n\nDocument 301919 is highly relevant to FOI request LS7888, which sought information on the AEC's *new methodology* for its Indigenous Electoral Participation Program (IEPP), specifically its *design, testing, and implementation*, including *catalysts*, *tracking*, and *outcomes*.\n\n*   **New Methodology and Design:** This document directly addresses the core of the \"new methodology\" by detailing the shift from unreliable regression models to the more robust, direct matching of electoral roll data with Centrelink Indigeneity data. It explains the design of this enhanced approach for estimating Indigenous enrolment rates.\n*   **Catalyst:** The document explicitly identifies the catalyst for this change: the problematic and alarmingly low estimates from the previous indirect regression models, coupled with the need for better franchise KPIs for \"Closing the Gap\" purposes. The informal proposal by the Research Section to leverage Centrelink data serves as the internal driver for this improvement.\n*   **Implementation and Tracking:** It describes the practical implementation of this method as part of the Annual Roll Integrity Review (ARIR) in 2017 and outlines the steps involved in calculating the improved enrolment rates, which are fundamental to tracking the effectiveness of the IEPP.\n*   **Outcomes:** While not directly providing specific enrolment numbers (which are found in other documents), this document describes the *process* that enables the AEC to achieve \"robust results\" and identify the Indigenous unenrolled population more accurately, which is crucial for the IEPP's goal of stimulating enrolments. The FOI overview states that this method identified over 107,000 unenrolled Indigenous individuals, directly stemming from the methodology described here.\n\nIn essence, this document provides foundational insight into the data-driven innovation that underpins the AEC's new approach to Indigenous electoral participation, fulfilling a key aspect of the FOI request."

  "prompt": "Considering this document as part of an FOI request, summarize the document and its relevance to the FOI request in markdown format. FYI the overview of the FOI request is: FOI request LS7888 sought documents (2018-2019) on the Australian Electoral Commission's (AEC) new methodology for its Indigenous Electoral Participation Program (IEPP), specifically its design, testing, and implementation, including catalysts, tracking, outcomes, Indigenous involvement, and cost/staff. The released documents, primarily emails and internal papers, reveal that the core of the new methodology is the direct matching of electoral roll data with Centrelink Indigeneity data, a more robust approach initiated internally to improve accuracy, replacing less reliable prior regression models. This method helped identify over 107,000 unenrolled Indigenous individuals, contributing to enrolment stimulation events (e.g., 2,646 new enrolments). The documents confirm estimated national Indigenous enrolment rates of 76.4% (June 2018) and 76.6% (June 2019), demonstrating a significant upward trend from previous estimates, though they provide limited information on Indigenous involvement in the design process or the final cost and exact staffing for the project.\n\nDocument Text:\n\nIndigenous Franchise KPIs using Centrelink data \n\nBackground \nAs Australia’s federal electoral roll does not have a personal Indigenous identifier, estimating the enrolment, \n rates for Indigenous persons is problematic. Having these key franchise KPIs for the \n\nIndigenous population is important for Closing the Gap purposes and the AECs focus on how the franchise \ncould be better delivered. \n\nIn 2014 the AEC’s Research Section commenced indirect estimation of these figures, using a regression model \nof the relationship between the Indigenous population and each of the three franchise KPIs at a small area \nlevel, such as polling place catchment or the ABS’ SA2 geography. While the models did not fit the data \nparticularly well, the resulting Indigenous enrolment, \nreal data, rather than anecdote. Yet the resulting enrolment and turnout rates in particular were alarmingly \nlow, and hopefully represented a worst case picture. \n\n rates were statistically based on \n\nCentrelink Data \nAround the same time, the Research Section informally proposed that person-level Centrelink extracts that the \nAEC received occasionally for other Roll validation work, could perhaps be extended to include Centrelink’s \nIndigenous indicator. This came to fruition in 20171. \n\nAs part of the Annual Roll Integrity Review (ARIR), the person-level matching between the Roll and Centrelink \nnow included Centrelink’s Indigenous indicator. However as Centrelink customers represent only around half \nof the Roll, the matching (even if perfect) would be far from assigning all enrolments an Indigenous flag. \nNevertheless, for the first time the AEC has a very large number of enrolled persons, over 6 million, with an \nexplicit Indigenous status. \n\nEnrolment Rate\n\n1.\nThe enrolment rate, even for all persons regardless of indigeneity, is difficult to calculate reliably due to \nconceptual, collection and methodological differences between the Roll (numerator) and the ABS-based \nenrolment-eligible population (denominator, “EEP”). In the case of the Indigenous population these problems \nare magnified by having no Indigenous identifier on the Roll and less reliable estimates of Indigenous EEP.  \n\nHowever, matching the Roll to Centrelink data allows a more direct method of estimating the Indigenous \nenrolment rate. It is still subject to quite courageous assumptions, but as fewer are required it likely \nrepresents an improved approach. In summary: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor all Centrelink customers with an identified Indigenous or non-Indigenous status, calculate the\nproportion on the Roll. This is the raw enrolment rate of Centrelink clients.\nCalculate the ratio of the actual AEC enrolment rate versus the Centrelink-based rate, for the same\npoint in time. This is the overall factor to adjust any Centrelink-based rates to align with AEC\nenrolment rates.\nApply the adjustment factor to raw Centrelink-based enrolment rates by Indigenous status to give\nIndigenous and non-Indigenous enrolment rates.\nThis process can be done at the State level, though results will have lower reliability.\n\nNOTE: While this method avoids indirectly modelling Indigenous enrolment rates via geographic \nassociation, it does assume that any bias in Centrelink clients being enrolled is equal for \nIndigenous and non-Indigenous, and that there are no substantive Indigenous-status biases \ninherent in the Roll-to-Centrelink person matching. \n\n1 Acknowledge with appreciation the work of the former Electoral Integrity Unit and the IT Branch. \n\nLS7888 Released Document No. 301919Released under the Freedom of Information Act 1982\fConclusion and Results \nThe Centrelink client file with Indigenous indicator newly available to the AEC has presented an excellent \nopportunity, via matching to the Roll and mark-off data, to improve estimation of Indigenous franchise KPIs.  \n\nWhile the results are subject to a number of non-trivial assumptions, the more direct estimation methods lead \nto a higher likelihood of robust results. The figures should nevertheless still be regarded as indicative only. \n\nLS7888 Released Document No. 301919Released under the Freedom of Information Act 1982 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fReleased under the Freedom of Information Act 1982\fREDACTION CODES \n\nPersonal Information (name) redacted. \n\nPersonal Information (date of birth) redacted. \n\nPersonal Information (photograph) redacted \n\nPersonal Information (facsimile of signature) redacted. \n\nPersonal Information (facsimile of manuscript initialling) redacted. \n\nPersonal Information (Individual’s address) redacted. \n\nPersonal Information (individual’s telephone number) redacted. \n\nPersonal Information (individual’s opinion) redacted. \n\nPersonal Information (opinion about individual) redacted. \n\nPersonal Information (employment history) redacted. \n\nPersonal Information (qualifications) redacted. \n\nPersonal Information (health) redacted. \n\nPersonal Information (identifying individual) redacted. \n\nBusiness information (Bank Account details) redacted. \n\nBusiness information (Billing Account details) redacted. \n\nBusiness information (internal operations) redacted. \n\nLegal Professional Communication redacted. \n\nDeliberative material redacted. \n\nIrrelevant material redacted. \n\nElectoral Roll material redacted. \n\nTests, examinations or audits material redacted. \n\nManagement or assessment of personnel material redacted. \n\nProper and efficient conduct of the operations of AEC material redacted. \n\nLawful methods or procedures for preventing, detecting, investigating, or \ndealing with matters arising out of, breaches or evasions of the law. \n\nTrade Secrets. \n\nCommercial valuable information. \n\nFinancial interests of the Commonwealth. \n\nProperty interests of the Commonwealth. \n\n1 \n\n2 \n\n3 \n\n4 \n\n5 \n\n6 \n\n7 \n\n8 \n\n9 \n\n10 \n\n11 \n\n12 \n\n13 \n\n14 \n\n15 \n\n16 \n\n17 \n\n18 \n\n19 \n\n20 \n\n21 \n\n22 \n\n23 \n\n24 \n\n25 \n\n26 \n\n27 \n\n28 \n\n\f\n\nProvide only the markdown formatted summary text.
