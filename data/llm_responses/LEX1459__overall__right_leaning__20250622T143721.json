            "text": "The FOI documents detail the Australian Electoral Commission's (AEC) process of deregistering \"VOTEFLUX.ORG | Upgrade Democracy!\" due to its failure to meet the statutory requirement of 1,500 members, as outlined in the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918.\n\nFrom a conservative perspective, these documents demonstrate government actions that align positively with several core principles:\n\n*   **Fiscal Responsibility and Economic Efficiency:** The AEC's rigorous membership testing and subsequent deregistration of a party that does not meet the minimum threshold exemplify prudent stewardship of public resources. Maintaining a register of political parties, particularly for electoral purposes, incurs administrative costs and allocates finite resources such as ballot space. By enforcing a clear membership requirement, the government ensures that taxpayer money and administrative effort are not wasted on unviable political entities lacking genuine public support. This process promotes efficiency in the electoral system by focusing resources on legitimate, established parties.\n*   **Limited Government and Rule of Law:** The AEC is operating strictly within its statutorily defined powers under the Electoral Act (Sections 123, 137, 138, 138A). The decision to deregister is based on a clear, objective, and quantifiable metric (1,500 members) and a defined methodology (ABS methodology for membership testing). This adherence to a pre-defined legal framework, rather than arbitrary bureaucratic discretion, is a hallmark of limited government. It demonstrates the government acting predictably and consistently according to established law, rather than overstepping its bounds.\n*   **Individual Liberty (in context of orderly process):** While individual liberty includes the freedom to associate and form political groups, the government's role here is to define the conditions for *official registration* as a political party for electoral purposes. This distinction is crucial; it does not curtail free speech or the right to associate, but rather establishes a clear and equitable standard for official recognition within the electoral system. By ensuring that only parties with demonstrable support gain official status, the process maintains an orderly and fair electoral landscape, which ultimately serves the broader public interest without unduly impeding individual freedoms. The consistent application of rules ensures fairness for all aspiring parties.\n*   **National Security (indirectly):** A stable and transparent electoral system, upheld by clear rules and consistent enforcement, contributes to domestic order and trust in democratic institutions. While not a direct national security issue, the integrity of the electoral process is foundational to a secure nation. Preventing the proliferation of unviable or potentially mischievous entities on the official register through clear gatekeeping measures indirectly supports this stability.\n\nIn summary, the government's actions, as revealed in these documents, largely align with conservative principles by demonstrating fiscal prudence, adherence to the rule of law, and the maintenance of an efficient and orderly electoral system through clearly defined and consistently applied regulations."

(the Party) \n\nPurpose \n\nThis minute asks you, as a delegate of the Electoral Commission, to deregister the Party under \ns 137(6) of the Electoral Act on the grounds that the Party does not have at least 1,500 members \n(s 137(1)(b) of the Electoral Act).  \n\nAuthority \n\nSections 123, 137, 138 and 138A of the Electoral Act. \n\nBackground \n\nOn 13 January 2022, you, as a delegate of the Electoral Commission, issued a notice to the \nRegistered Officer of the Party, Mr Nathan Spataro, under s 137 of the Electoral Act (the s 137 \nNotice) stating that the Electoral Commission is considering deregistering the Party (OBJECT IDs: \nA1319272 and A1442167). The Registered Officer of the Party had until 13 February 2022 to provide \na response.  \n\nOn 13 February 2022, the Party responded to the s 137 Notice: \n\n•  Response received – OBJECT ID: A1369037 \n•  Statement – OBJECT ID: A1369035 \n•  Supplementary membership list – OBJECT ID: A1369039 \n\nOn 2 March 2022, you, as a delegate of the Electoral Commission, having considered the statement \nlodged by the Party, and membership list lodged in support of that statement containing 4,680 \nnames, requested that further membership testing be performed. In confirming your advice, you \ninstructed to select the top 1,650 names for testing to conform with the AEC’s testing methodology \nparameters. Please see OBJECT ID: A1406912. \n\nMinute  \n\nPage 1\n\n\n--- Page 2 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 3 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 4 ---\n\nOFFICIAL \n\nApplication to change the Party’s name, abbreviation and logo in the Register \n\nOn 19 February 2022, the Party lodged an application in accordance with s 134 of the Electoral Act \nto change its name, abbreviation and logo in the Register (OBJECT ID: A1396302). The Party’s logo \npassed validation and has been assessed by CRE8IVE (OBJECT IDs: A1421693 and A1421695). If \nthe Party is deregistered, the application lodged under s 134 of the Electoral Act will no longer be \nvalid. \n\nConclusion \n\nOn 13 January 2022, a notice was issued a notice to the Registered Officer of the Party under s 137 \nof the Electoral Act stating that the Electoral Commission is considering deregistering the Party \n\nOn 13 February 2022, the party responded to the s 137 Notice providing a statement and a \nmembership list in support of that statement. \n\nAn assessment of the Party’s membership list was undertaken and based on the ABS methodology it \ndemonstrated that the Party has failed to demonstrate to have at least 1,500 members.  \n\nAccordingly, there are reasonable grounds on which you, as the delegate of the Electoral \nCommission, can be satisfied that the Party does not have at least 1,500 members. Based on this \ninformation, you may determine under s 138A of the Electoral Act that the Party is not an ‘eligible \npolitical party’ and should be deregistered. \n\nIf you, as the delegate of the Electoral Commission is of this view, you should not deregister the \nParty under s 137 of the Electoral Act and advise the Registered Officer of this decision.  \n\nMinute  \n\nPage 4\n\n\n--- Page 5 ---\n\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 1 ---\n\n\n\nProvide only the markdown formatted summary text.
