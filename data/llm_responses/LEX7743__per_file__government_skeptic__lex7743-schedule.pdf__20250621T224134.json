The very existence of an FOI request for information already declared \"publicly available\" on a \"transparency website\" suggests a profound flaw in government information architecture, rendering supposedly accessible data practically undiscoverable. This forces citizens to waste FOI resources to confirm the public status of information, creating an illusion of active \"release\" where none was necessary. Alternatively, this process exposes a cynical ploy to inflate transparency claims by formally \"releasing\" material that was never genuinely withheld, thereby occupying FOI channels that could otherwise be used to probe areas of true government opacity and inefficiency. It demonstrates a lack of accountability for making information genuinely accessible, instead relying on a cumbersome, resource-intensive process to confirm what should be self-evident."
