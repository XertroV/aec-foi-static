            "text": "This document reveals the Australian Electoral Commission's deep and expanding reliance on Microsoft, a private, for-profit tech giant, for critical functions related to election integrity, raising significant left-leaning concerns about democratic accountability and civil liberties.\n\nThe correspondence details Microsoft's \"Democracy Forward\" program, positioning the corporation as a key partner in safeguarding Australian elections. This involves extensive briefings and engagements between AEC's \"Defending Democracy Unit,\" \"Electoral Integrity Assurance Taskforce\" (EIAT), Acting Commissioner, and Microsoft's various departments (Corporate External and Legal Affairs, Threat Analysis Centre, Threat Intelligence Centre, LinkedIn).\n\nCrucially, the document highlights how core democratic functions are being outsourced:\n*   **Content Moderation and Information Control:** Discussions revolve around \"content credentialing and pilot next steps,\" implying Microsoft's direct involvement in defining and labeling \"authentic\" media, potentially enabling state-sanctioned censorship by proxy. Furthermore, the AEC explicitly seeks to establish \"referral pathways\" with Microsoft/LinkedIn for \"online content of concern,\" effectively privatizing a vital aspect of public discourse oversight.\n*   **Suppression of Digital Expression:** A particularly alarming revelation is the AEC's request for Microsoft to \"block AI image generation of specific AEC employees\" and \"prominent figures plus federal candidates\" using its AI tools. This represents a direct attempt by a government agency to control the digital representation of public figures through a private corporation, a profound erosion of freedom of speech and the public's right to unadulterated information. The redacted \"spreadsheet of names\" underscores the deliberate obfuscation of these efforts.\n*   **Outsourcing Core Infrastructure and Intelligence:** Microsoft provides \"AccountGuard\" for cybersecurity, \"Azure for Election service\" for voter databases (offering \"proactive security reviews, resilience assessments, and load analysis,\" and \"highest tier of reactive support\"), and \"dedicated escalation points\" for \"election-sensitive issues.\" This signals a concerning hand-over of vital democratic infrastructure and intelligence to a private entity, reinforcing concentrated corporate power.\n*   **Lack of Transparency:** The extensive redactions throughout the document (s22, s47F/E/G) severely undermine public transparency and accountability. They obscure the full scope and nature of these partnerships, leaving citizens in the dark about the influence exerted by a private corporation over the integrity of their democratic processes.\n*   **Broader Implications:** The AEC's inquiry into a US subpoena served on Microsoft concerning \"foreign censorship of American speech\" further indicates Microsoft's global involvement in content control, reinforcing concerns about its potential role in limiting speech and shaping narratives within Australia.\n\nIn summary, this document exemplifies a concerning shift where a public democratic institution increasingly relies on a global tech giant for functions that are fundamental to free and fair elections, from cybersecurity to content moderation and even controlling digital likenesses, all while operating with a significant lack of transparency."

Emphasize its implications for social equity, environmental concerns, or democratic accountability. The overall FOI overview is: The Australian Electoral Commission's reliance on global tech giants like X, Google, Meta, and Microsoft for election integrity, detailed in FOI documents, signals a concerning shift where core democratic functions are increasingly outsourced to private, for-profit entities. This dependency, particularly evident in content moderation \"referral pathways\" and Microsoft's \"Democracy Forward\" program, risks ceding significant control over public discourse to unelected corporations, thereby reinforcing concentrated corporate power and wealth. Compounded by extensive redactions that obscure the full scope of these interactions, this approach undermines public transparency and accountability, raising serious concerns from a left-leaning perspective about potential state-sanctioned censorship by proxy, the erosion of civil liberties like freedom of speech, and a fundamental deviation from publicly governed democratic processes.\n\nDocument Text:\n\nSubject:\n\nLocation:\n\nStart:\nEnd:\nShow Time As:\n\nRecurrence:\n\nOrganiser:\nRequired Attendees:\nOptional Attendees:\n\n (Microsoft) & Commissioner   \n\nCanceled: Placeholder | \n[SEC=OFFICIAL]\nNO - Commissioner's Office\n\nWed 22/01/2025 1:30 PM\nWed 22/01/2025 2:30 PM\nFree\n\n(none)\n\nJeff Pope\n\n; \n\n; Defending Democracy Unit\n\n; \n\nCancelled as updated meeting invite sent for same time. \n________________________________________________________________________________ \n\nMicrosoft Teams Need help?  \n\nJoin the meeting now  \n\nMeeting ID: \n\nPasscode: \n\n3  \n\nDial in by phone  \n\nPhone conference ID: \n\n Australia, Sydney  \n\nFor organizers: Meeting options | Reset dial-in PIN  \n\nTo help p o ect y ou  p iv acy  M c osoft Off ce p ev ented au omat c download of th s pictu e f om the Inte net\n\nThis meeting invitation was generated by the AEC Microsoft Teams instance \n\n________________________________________ \n\n | Personal Assistant to the Commissioner  \n\nExecutive Leadership Team \nAustralian Electoral Commission \n M: \nT: \n\n X:\n\n1\n\ns47Fs22s47Fs47Fs47Fs47Fs47Es47Es47Es47Es47Es47Fs47Fs47Fs47F  \n  \n  \n \n  \n  \n  \n\f________________________________________ \n\n2\n\n \n  \n  \n  \n  \n\f1\n\ns22s22s22\fFrom: \nSent: Friday, 13 December 2024 9:18 AM \nTo: \nCc: \n\nSubject: Microsoft Democracy Forward: Canberra, Wed 22 Jan \n\nCAUTION: This email originated from outside of the Australian Federal Government.

Please see below an update from Microsoft on \nmeasures implemented to meet the commitments agreed to as a signatory of the Tech Accord to \nCombat Deceptive Use of AI in 2024 Elections.  \n\nSince the adoption of the Tech Accord in February 2024, Microsoft has made significant strides to \nprevent the creation of deceptive AI targeting elections, enhance detection and response \ncapabilities, and improve transparency and public awareness.  \n\nMicrosoft’s Democracy Forward team works closely with campaigns, electoral commissions and \nother entities around the world to support the integrity of the elections, and Microsoft’s Threat \nAnalysis Center (MTAC) analyses nation-state threats to provide intelligence and insights on \ncyberattacks and influence operations. In 2024, this took us to a range of jurisdictions, including \nTaiwan, India, the UK, the EU and the US.  \n\nWe are bringing this same approach to the forthcoming Australian federal election in 2025. \n\nWe are committed to a set of election protection principles to help safeguard voters, candidates \nand campaigns, and election authorities worldwide. These principles are: \n\n•  Voters have a right to transparent and authoritative information regarding elections. \n\n•  Candidates should be able to assert when content originates from their campaign and have \nrecourse when their likeness or content is distorted by AI for the purpose of deceiving the \npublic during the course of an election. \n\n•  Political campaigns should protect themselves from cyber threats and be able to navigate \n\nAI with access to affordable and easily deployed tools, trainings, and support. \n\n•  Election authorities should be able to ensure a secure and resilient election process and \n\nhave access to tools and services that enable this process. \n\nFurther to our September 2024 progress update, this document sets out further detail on the steps \nwe have and are taking to implement the Accord in the lead-up to Australia’s federal election in \n2025. \n\ns47F \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fAddressing Deepfake Creation  \n\nWe recognise that companies whose products are used to create AI generated content have a \nresponsibility to ensure images and videos generated from their systems include indicators of their \norigin. One way to accomplish this is through content provenance, enabled by an open standard \ncreated by the Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity (C2PA). Microsoft is a founding \nmember of C2PA and has leveraged this standard (“Content Credentials”) across several of our \nproducts, ensuring that AI generated content is marked as such and that the creator and \ntimestamp of images is recorded.  \n\nSpecifically, Microsoft has added Content Credentials to all images created with our most popular \nconsumer facing AI image generation tools, including Bing Image Creator, Microsoft Designer, \nCopilot, and in our enterprise API image generation tools including Azure OpenAI DALL-E. We \nrecently started testing a Content Credentials display in Word. When images with Content \nCredentials are inserted into Word documents, future viewers will be able to right click and see the \ncredits and author information of these images. In addition, images with Content Credentials \nuploaded to LinkedIn are automatically labeled and the credential information is shown to end \nusers.  \n\nAs important as it is to mark content as AI generated, a healthy information ecosystem relies on \nother indicators of authenticity as well. We launched and expanded our Content Integrity Tools to \nsupport  global elections in 2024 - through the creation of a pilot program that allows political \ncampaigns, elections authorities, and select news media organizations globally, to access a tool \nthat enables them to easily apply Content Credentials to their own authentic images and videos.  \n\nWe also joined forces with fellow Tech Accord signatory Truepic. Microsoft and Truepic have jointly \nreleased an app that simplifies the process of adding Content Credentials to authentically \ncaptured smartphone camera images, video, and audio for participants of the pilot. This app has \nnow launched for both Android and Apple devices and can be used by those enrolled in Content \nCredentials program.  \n\nDetecting and Responding to Deepfakes  \n\nMicrosoft is harnessing the data science and technical capabilities of our AI for Good Lab and \nMicrosoft Threat Analysis Centre (MTAC) teams to better assess whether content—including that \ncreated and disseminated by foreign actors—is synthetic or not. Microsoft’s AI for Good lab has \ndeveloped and is using detection models (image, video) to assess whether media was g enerated \nor manipulated by AI. We can use this detection capability in the context of election campaigns to \nsupport integrity. \n\nWe are also working with our partners at True Media to provide governments, civil society and \njournalists with access to free tools that enable them to check whether an image or video was AI \ngenerated and/or manipulated. Microsoft’s contribution includes providing True Media with access \nto Microsoft classifiers, tools, personnel, and data. These contributions will enable True Media to \ntrain AI detection models, share relevant data, evaluate and refine new detection models as well as \nprovide feedback on quality and classification methodologies.  \n\n \n\fWe are also empowering candidates, campaigns and election authorities to help us detect and \nrespond to deceptive AI that is targeting elections. In February we launched the Microsoft-2024 \nElections site. This site empowers candidates, campaigns or election authorities to directly report \ndeceptive AI election content on Microsoft consumer services. This reporting tool allows for 24/7 \nreporting by impacted election entities who have been targeted by deceptive AI found on Microsoft \nplatforms.  \n\nTransparency and Resilience  \n\nIn advance of the EU elections we kicked off a global effort to engage campaigns and elections \nauthorities. This enabled us to deepen understanding of the possible risks of deceptive AI in \nelections and empower those campaigns and election officials to speak directly to their voters \nabout these risks and the steps they can take to build resilience and increase confidence in the \nelection. So far this year we have conducted more than 200 training sessions for political \nstakeholders in 23 countries, reaching more than 6,000 participants. We are working closely with \nthe Australian Electoral Commission along with political and media stakeholders in Australia, to \nprovide support in preparation for the next federal election.  \n\nBuilding on this training, we have established a public website entitled “Check, Recheck, Vote,” \nwhich educates voters of the possible risks posed by deepfakes and empowers them to take steps \nto identify trusted sources of election information, look for indicators of trust like content \nprovenance, and pause before they link to or share election content. This includes our ‘Real or \nNot?’ Quiz, developed by our AI for Good lab to expose users to the challenges of detecting a \npossible deepfake. So far, individuals from 150+ countries have taken the quiz. We are exploring \nsimilar activities in Australia.  \n\nProtecting Campaign and Election Infrastructure  \n\nSince the 2016 US election, adversaries have regularly targeted essential systems that support \nelections and campaigns in the US to advance their cyber enabled influence operations. Recent \nIranian hacking incidents involved attempts by these actors to provide stolen or allegedly stolen \nmaterial to the media to propagate narratives of dissent and distrust. This underscores why we \ncontinue to invest in efforts that focus on safeguarding the critical infrastructure that underpins our \nelections.  \n\nOur efforts include several initiatives designed to support election officials and political \norganizations. First, we offer AccountGuard, a no-cost cybersecurity service available to our cloud \nemail customers in 35 countries, including Australia. This service provides advanced threat \ndetection and notifications against nation-state adversaries for high-risk customers, including \nthose involved in elections. AccountGuard extends beyond commercial customers to individuals at \nelection organizations, their affiliates, and immediate family members who may use personal \nMicrosoft accounts for email. We have observed that sophisticated adversaries often target both \nprofessional and personal accounts, amplifying the need for comprehensive protection. More than \n5.4 million mailboxes of high-risk users are now protected by AccountGuard globally.  \n\n \n\fFor critical election-adjacent systems, such as voter registration databases and voter information \nportals, we provide our Azure for Election service. This service provides proactive security reviews, \nresilience assessments, and load analysis. During the election week, we offer our highest tier of \nreactive support to address any security or availability issues that may arise.  \n\nIn the upcoming election in Australia, as per previous federal and state electoral events, we \nestablish a dedicated escalation point staffed by our team to provide constant management and \ntriage of any election-sensitive issues and maintain real-time communications across our industry \npartners. This ensured that any incidents received the highest level of priority and executive \nsupport.  \n\nWhile we continue to provide robust security services, we recognize that collaboration is essential. \nPublic-private partnerships are crucial in strengthening the entire ecosystem. For example, our \nDemocracy Forward team actively participates in tabletop cybersecurity training exercises \nconvened by US election officials.  \n\nMicrosoft remains steadfast in its commitment to supporting the security and integrity of \ndemocratic processes. Through our comprehensive programs and collaborative efforts, we aim to \nprotect democracy from the evolving threats posed by nation-state actors.  \n\nWe look forward to supporting the AEC during the upcoming electoral period, including through the \nvisit to Canberra in late January by executives from our Democracy Forward team.  \n\nYours sincerely \n\nDirector, Corporate External and Legal Affairs \nMicrosoft Australia and New Zealand \n9 January 2025 \n\ns47F \n \n \n \n \n\fFrom:\nSent:\nTo:\nSubject:\n\nDefending Democracy Unit \nTuesday, 29 October 2024 11:39 AM\n\nFW: Request for information: blocking Microsoft AI image generation of specific \nAEC employees [SEC=OFFICIAL]\n\n| Assistant Director  \n\nDefending Democracy Unit | Electoral Integrity and Media Branch \nAustralian Electoral Commission \nPhone: \n\n | DDU Group Line: \n\n | Protected email: \n\nFrom: \nSent: Wednesday, 16 October 2024 4:28 PM \nTo:\nCc: Defending Democracy Unit ; \nSubject: RE: Request for information: blocking Microsoft AI image generation of specific AEC employees \n[SEC=OFFICIAL] \n\nHi \n\nThanks for getting back to me so quickly.

As you know from our most recent engagements with Democracy Forward the last few months of \n\n2024, there is a lot that week can cover and want to ensure we are prepared to meet the \nCommissioners interests.  \nc.  Some suggested topics include: \n\ni.  execu(cid:415)ve level brieﬁng on the cyber threat landscape (MTAC/MSTIC insights);  \nii.  support for electoral prepara(cid:415)ons from the technical/customer support perspec(cid:415)ve;  \niii.  content creden(cid:415)alling and pilot next steps; \niv.  synthe(cid:415)c media and AI related harms, including advice on how to respond to incidents \nv.  overview of the Democracy Forward visit program including training for poli(cid:415)cal campaigns \n\nand journalists; \n\nvi.  update on implementa(cid:415)on of the Tech Accord (as per correspondence this month)  \nvii.  any other topics of interest \n\n3)  Brieﬁng with EIAT \n\na.

I’ll \ncheck in with the people who know how to manage this to make sure it’s good to go for next Monday. \n\nAgenda items \nI haven’t put together a formal agenda, but can ﬂag that areas of interest will include the following: \n\n  What has Microso(cid:332) observed or learned in rela(cid:415)on to how electoral integrity* has been \n\nmanaged/maintained globally this year? \n\no  What has happened that you were expec(cid:415)ng? \no  What has surprised you (both posi(cid:415)ve and nega(cid:415)ve)? \no  What could Australia learn from this? \n\n  How has Microso(cid:332) adapted its approach to elec(cid:415)ons based on what it has learned so far this year? \n  What are some useful (or terrible!) approaches to mi(cid:415)ga(cid:415)ng threats to electoral integrity that you have \n\nobserved from other pla(cid:414)orms and/or from other electoral management bodies? \n\n  What are Microso(cid:332)’s insights (if any) into the Sovereign Ci(cid:415)zen movement? \n  How big an impact do you assess AI has had on elec(cid:415)ons to date? \n\no  The existence of AI generated mis and disinforma(cid:415)on, deepfakes etc does not necessarily correlate \n\nwith impact \n\n*We usually consider threats to electoral integrity in terms of cyber, mis/disinforma(cid:415)on, physical threats and foreign \ninterference, but of course there is plenty of overlap between these four areas. \n\nAlso, ONI reps queried whether your teams are aware of ONI’s ongoing discussions to contract support from \nMicroso(cid:332) Threat Intelligence Center (MSTIC) and Microso(cid:332) Threat Analysis Center (MTAC). They didn’t ﬂag any \nques(cid:415)ons or issues but might appreciate an update on whether you are aware of this and how the Democracy \nForward team interacts with the other two. \n\nLastly, Ma(cid:425) is copied in, but I will follow up to ﬂag that \nno doubt he would be keen for a chat. \n\n will be at the conference in Singapore next week.
