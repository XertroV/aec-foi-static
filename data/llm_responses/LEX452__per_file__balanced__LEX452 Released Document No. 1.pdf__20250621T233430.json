            "text": "This document, titled \"REDACTION CODES\", lists the categories of information that have been redacted from documents released under the Freedom of Information Act 1982. The codes cover a wide range of sensitive data, including personal information (e.g., name, address, date of birth, signature, opinions), business information (e.g., bank account details), internal operational details (e.g., deliberative material, irrelevant material, internal operations of AEC), and information related to legal processes or electoral roll data.\n\n**Relevance to FOI Request LEX452:**\n\nThis document is directly relevant to FOI request LEX452 because the overview states that the three letters from the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) released in response to the request \"feature redactions\". While this document does not contain information about Zi Chun Wang's donations or the AEC's administrative process, it serves as the key to understanding the nature of the information withheld in those released letters. It explains the categories of data that were deemed exempt from disclosure and subsequently redacted, providing transparency regarding the redaction rationale for the documents provided under LEX452."

FYI the overview of the FOI request is: FOI request LEX452 sought documents concerning Zi Chun Wang's donations for the 2013/2014 financial year, resulting in the release of three letters from the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC).
