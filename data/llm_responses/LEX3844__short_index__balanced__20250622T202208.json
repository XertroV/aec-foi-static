It specifies comprehensive security protocols aligned with Australian Government frameworks (PSPF, ISM), including secure physical zones with CCTV and access controls, and strict handling procedures for varied ballot papers with AEC pre-sorting and vendor restrictions. The solution also requires high data capture accuracy compliant with the Electoral Act and readiness for rapid electoral support. The Work Order formally established the contractual engagement, integrating the \"Statement of Requirements\" as a core component of the sensitive \"CAPTURE AND DIGITAL INFORMATION SERVICES\" agreement."
