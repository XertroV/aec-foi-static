The team is also \nresponsible for management of the below shared mailboxes: \n\n \n\ninfo@aec.gov.au  \n\n  complaints.management@aec.gov.au \n\n \n\nPhone calls \n\n– used for internal enquiries only \n\nYou will only receive calls between 9am and 5pm weekdays. Outside of these hours, callers will \nhear a recorded message. On a public holiday, callers will hear a different message. We are \nresponsible for recording this message. See Recorded Messages. \n\nIt is your responsibility to: \n\n■  Answer incoming calls \n■  Manage and monitor the email boxes \n■  Provide prompt and appropriate responses to requests for information, noting the AECs \n\nservice levels \n\n■  Provide relevant and accurate information to the general public on electoral matters \n■  Maintain appropriate confidentiality about dealings with the general public, and behave in \na way that upholds the integrity and reputation of the AEC and Aust. Public Service (APS) \n\nInformation technology \nThe AEC has various databases which contain personal information and other sensitive and \nconfidential data including: \n\nInformation about current and former AEC employees \n\n■  Personal information about electors  \n■ \n■  Financial data \n■  Election management data \n\nThis information needs to be protected from unauthorised access, amendment and disclosure \nand to meet statutory obligations under the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918, the Privacy Act \n1988, and the Crimes Act 1914. \n\nPage 3    Public Enquiries Handbook |  \nObjective: SD&F > Roll Ops & Client Services > Public Engagement > Public Enquiries > Policy and Procedure, or \nhttps://objective.prod.aec.gov.au/documents/fA94851\n\n\n--- Page 5 ---\n\nIt is your responsibility to ensure the integrity of the information in your care is only used for \nofficial purposes. Please familiarise yourself with the privacy information and principles which \noutline your responsibilities about the use, collection and storage of information. \n\nYour user ID and other login information (such as passwords) allow you access to IT systems.  \nYou must not disclose these to anyone, including colleagues, nor leave your computer open \nwhen unattended. \n\nIf a breach of security occurs through unauthorised use of your user ID and password, you may \nbe held personally responsible. \n\nAEC contact telephone numbers  \nThe AEC has several telephone numbers as outlined below. The AEC switchboard is the \nresponsibility of the Parliamentary and Party Registration section in NO. \n\n■  13 23 26 – This is the generic telephone number for the AEC’s divisional offices and is \n\nused on all public advertising and listings. Most calls to this phone number will be diverted \nto a divisional office after the caller enters their postcode. Where a caller does not enter a \npostcode, the call is diverted to their state office. All calls to this number from within \nAustralia are the cost of a local call. Overseas callers cannot dial this number. \n\n■  +61 2 6160 2600 – This number is advertised on our website specifically for people who \nare calling from overseas. This directs people to enter the postcode for their enrolled \naddress. Their call is then diverted to the relevant divisional office, based on the postcode \nthey enter. If no postcode is entered, the call is diverted to the National Office switchboard \nnumber, below. \n(02) 6271 4411 – AEC switchboard in National Office. This number is published on our \nwebsite along with our state office switchboard numbers. \nInterpreter calls – This is a service where non-English speaking callers can have a three-\nway conversation with the AEC, assisted by an interpreter in their own language. Further \ninformation on this service is available below.  \n\n■ \n\n■ \n\n■  10 Mort St – Security Guards – \n\nHours of operation \nThe switchboard responds to incoming calls received from the general public as follows: \n\n■  Non-election hours of operation – 9am to 5pm (Monday to Friday) \n\nDuring a federal election, the switchboard is diverted to the AECs escalation cell and the INFO \nand Complaints mailboxes are diverted to the AEC’s Election Contact Centre. \n\nPage 4    Public Enquiries Handbook |  \nObjective: SD&F > Roll Ops & Client Services > Public Engagement > Public Enquiries > Policy and Procedure, or \nhttps://objective.prod.aec.gov.au/documents/fA94851\n\n\n--- Page 6 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 7 ---\n\n \n\nthe Objective file path is: Enabling and Regulation Division > Disclosure Assurance and \nEngagement Branch > Parliamentary Engagement and Party Registration Section > \nPublic Engagement; \n\n \n\nthe folder is https://objective.prod.aec.gov.au/documents/fA13482  \n\nThe structure of information contained in the Public Engagement folders is as follows \n\nPublic Engagement Contact Tool \nPublic Engagement are responsible for management of the Public Engagement Contact Tool  \n(PECT) system. \n\nPECT is the AECs official system to record and escalate enquiries and complaints. \n\nAll AEC staff are required to enter all public enquiries, feedback and complaints received. The \nonly exception to this rule is enquiries received in the info@aec.gov.au mailbox – these are \nrecorded separately. Due to the volume of email enquiries we receive, the Public Engagement \nteam is required to enter into PECT all phone calls and emailed complaints only. If a complaint \nneeds to be escalated to another business area or division, it must be done through PECT. The \nexceptions are legal enquiries and complaints – these are to be forwarded via email to the Legal \nMailbox, marked ‘Official’.  \n\nReporting \n\nPage 6    Public Enquiries Handbook |  \nObjective: SD&F > Roll Ops & Client Services > Public Engagement > Public Enquiries > Policy and Procedure, or \nhttps://objective.prod.aec.gov.au/documents/fA94851\n\n\n--- Page 8 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 9 ---\n\nEnglish-speaking callers can have a three-way conversation with the AEC in their own language, \nassisted by an interpreter.   \n\nCalls go to a nominated number in each state. If you receive a call, you will hear an automated \nmessage explaining it is an interpreter call and to press zero (0) to accept the call.   \n\nAlways accept interpreter calls. There is also a range of translated information on our website in \nmore than 30 languages. Please let the caller know this information is available and offer to email \nor mail this information to them, as they may have trouble navigating our website, which is written \nin English. \n\nInvoices from Interpreter companies \nAlthough we have a contract in place with LanguageLoop, we also accept calls made via Home \nAffairs’ TIS. A Spending Approval form must be completed at the start of each financial year for \nTis if we decide to keep accepting interpreter calls from them. This is signed off by the relevant \nbranch delegate, usually our Director.  \n\nAt the start of each month, we receive invoices in the Public Engagement mailbox from both \ncompanies. We also receive a monthly report spreadsheet of itemised calls from Vits in the first \nweek of each month.  Please check the itemised list of calls is correct, as per the instructions \nbelow, before approving any public spending. Once you have approved them, complete and code \nthe invoices and send a copy of the Vits account to Accounts to be paid. The Tis invoice is paid \nby credit card. Provide the codes and send them, along with the invoice to \npay it via credit card. A copy of both invoices is kept in the white folder on \n\n who will \n\n desk.  \n\nTis invoices: Check that the phone number for each call is 13 23 26 because calls for other \nelectoral commissions occasionally slip through onto our account. The only phone number we \nhave approved for Tis to use is 13 23 26. If there are any discrepancies, you must contact Tis \nand have the charges reversed. For the financial year, you must ensure you keep a tally of the \namount spent to ensure it does not exceed the spending approval amount. This is always kept in \nthe white folder on \n\ndesk. \n\nVits invoices: Vits invoices are sent to \nrequired. \nthe call breakdown (not the invoice) to the following group of people each month: \n\nreceives a call breakdown at the start of each month. \n\n to approve, within the finance system.

You will \n\nhear beeps. \n\n  Put handset down \n\n  Check that phone has been forwarded to the selected phone number by phoning 02 6271 \n\n4411 from another phone. \n\nTo transfer calls back to the switchboard. \n\n  Press ‘Fwd Cancel’ (FC). You will hear beeps. \n\n  Pick up and put handset down \n\n  Check that phone has returned to the PE team by phoning 02 6271 4411 from another \n\nphone. \n\nNational Relay Service \nThe National Relay Service (NRS) is a telephone service for people who are deaf or have a \nhearing or speech impairment.  It is a government initiative managed through the Australian \nCommunications and Media Authority (ACMA). People are able to call the AEC via the NRS to \nfacilitate the conversation. \n\nWhen you receive an NRS-facilitated call, the relay officer will announce the call to you, such as, \n‘Hello, I have a call for the AEC from the National Relay Service. I have [caller’s name] on the \nline. Please go ahead’.   \n\nYou may find that there is a short delay as the relay officer uses their keyboard to type your \nresponse to the caller and the caller types to the NRS in return. You may hear the relay officer on \nthe line, or in some cases, the caller themselves.  \n\nDuring the call, it may be useful to say ‘Go ahead’ when you have finished speaking. We do not \nreceive invoices for this service. It is a government initiative open to anyone to use. \n\nRecorded messages for switchboard \nCallers who ring the National Office switchboard number (02 6271 4411) outside our business \nhours (9-5pm) will hear a pre-recorded message providing them with information regarding our \nhours of operation.   \n\nPage 9    Public Enquiries Handbook |  \nObjective: SD&F > Roll Ops & Client Services > Public Engagement > Public Enquiries > Policy and Procedure, or \nhttps://objective.prod.aec.gov.au/documents/fA94851\n\n\n--- Page 11 ---\n\nIt is our responsibility to record these messages when they require changing. Prior to each ACT \npublic holiday and the Christmas shutdown period, you will need to ensure this is done. See \nAppendix D for detailed instructions on recording voicemail messages. See Appendix C for a full \ntranscript of each recorded message. \n\nRecorded message (IVR) for 13 23 26 number \nThis is the recorded message on the 13 number. Outside of a federal election, there are \noccasions where you may wish to update this and put a diversion in place. To have the message \nchanged, you must either email the AEC’s telephony section in IT with a request, or submit an IT \nrequest form with the details. Often you will need to provide a week’s notice. Always check it has \ngone through by ringing the 13 number. \n\nGoogle – to update AEC office locations \n\nEmail Procedures  \n\nMailboxes \nThe Public Engagement team are responsible for the following mailboxes: \n\n \n\ninfo \n\nPage 10    Public Enquiries Handbook |  \nObjective: SD&F > Roll Ops & Client Services > Public Engagement > Public Enquiries > Policy and Procedure, or \nhttps://objective.prod.aec.gov.au/documents/fA94851\n\n\n--- Page 12 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 13 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 14 ---\n\nAt the start of each year, the previous year’s content must be moved into the folder titled \n‘Archived Data’. This includes all the sent emails for the previous year. You can do this yourself \nor ask IT Support for assistance. If you are archiving 2020 data for example, a new folder needs \nto be created under 2020 titled ‘Sent’. All emails from the INFO sent folder must be moved into \nthis folder. This makes searching for a sent email a lot faster. This also means at the start of each \nyear, the INFO sent folder will be empty. \n\nINFO Personal Message Manager (PMM) \nThe PMM is a SPAM (junk mail) filter. This works in the background to filter out any incoming \nemails which the AEC IT system thinks may be junk or malicious.  \n\nEach afternoon at 3pm, you will usually receive an email from pmm@aec.gov.au. It contains a \nlink for you to check any emails which the system has deemed to be possible spam or malicious. \nYou must check the spam for each of the three shared mailboxes each day. Also check your \npersonal mailbox.  \n\nTo add the shared mailboxes to your spam filter, refer to the image below. Select the ‘Options’ \ntab in the blue toolbar at the top of the page, then select ‘new’. \n\nEnter the shared mailbox address and select OK. \n\nPage 13    Public Enquiries Handbook |  \nObjective: SD&F > Roll Ops & Client Services > Public Engagement > Public Enquiries > Policy and Procedure, or \nhttps://objective.prod.aec.gov.au/documents/fA94851\n\n\n--- Page 15 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 16 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 17 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 18 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 19 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 20 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 21 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 22 ---\n\nIf the enquiry is an APS staff member, they should be transferred to: \n\nHuman Resources/Payroll  \n\nThere are also Recruitment Officers, WH&S Officers, Rehabilitation Case Managers, etc., which \nyou may need to transfer calls through to. To decide where to transfer the call, open the AEC \nintranet homepage and using the top right-hand search bar, enter the name or area you are \nlooking for. Alternatively there are branch contact lists which can be accessed at the bottom of \nevery intranet page under the heading ‘Offices & branches’. You can also search AEC corporate \ndirectory numbers through your desk phone. \n\nElectoral roll enquiries \nIf a member of the public wishes to view the current electoral roll, a copy is available for public \ninspection at any AEC office. Alternatively, the enquirer can check their enrolment on our \nwebsite. The AEC does not have publicly-available historic rolls. \n\nEnrolment statistics \nIf you receive a request for enrolment stats, not available on our website, please refer it to \n\nRequests for roll data \nAll requests for a copy of the electoral roll from candidates, government agencies or health \nbodies are to be referred to Roll Products in NO at \npublic or commercial organisations, searching for an individual, can be provided with our \nstandard reply.

Refer the enquirer to the Dept. of Finance \nwebsite for information: \n\nhttp://www.finance.gov.au/ \n\nIf they do not have internet access, give the enquirer the following contact details: \n\nPhone: 02 6215 2222 \n\nEnquiry/Complaint from organisation wanting copy of the roll \nThe policy details are outlined in Roll Why – Access to Enrolment Information.  \n\nCurrent roll: \n\nAll requests for the current roll should be referred to Roll Product and services (RPS).  \n\nHistoric roll: \n\nRequests for old electoral rolls. These are available through any local library but only up until \n2004. After 2004, access to the roll was restricted and no longer provided to libraries.  \n\nPrior to 2004 the roll was freely available for purchase. Following the implementation of the \nElectoral and Referendum Amendment (Access to the roll and other measures) Act 2004, the roll \nwas prohibited from sale. \n\nPre-2004 enrolment data may also exist on other internet sites (e.g. ancestry.com). \n\nPage 22    Public Enquiries Handbook |  \nObjective: SD&F > Roll Ops & Client Services > Public Engagement > Public Enquiries > Policy and Procedure, or \nhttps://objective.prod.aec.gov.au/documents/fA94851\n\n\n--- Page 24 ---\n\nCopies of the current electoral roll may only be disclosed to prescribed persons or organisations \nas listed in the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918. \n\nEnrolment Fraud \nIn order to manage the workload associated with the investigation of possible enrolment fraud, \nRMCE and the enrolment network take on a triage role, undertaking the initial investigation of \npotential cases. \n\nAll potential cases of enrolment fraud should now be forwarded to RMCE \nfirst instance. \n\n in the \n\nIndustrial elections and Protected Action Ballots (PAB) \nThe AEC conducts other elections in accordance with the Fair Work Act. \n\nIf you receive any enquiries regarding Industrial Elections or PABs, a list of industrial elections we \nare currently running is available on our website:  \n\nhttps://www.aec.gov.au/ieb/industrial-elections.htm \n\nPlease refer any enquiries either to the relevant state Returning Officer, as per the table below, or \nto: \n\nIndustrial Elections: \n\nPage 23    Public Enquiries Handbook |  \nObjective: SD&F > Roll Ops & Client Services > Public Engagement > Public Enquiries > Policy and Procedure, or \nhttps://objective.prod.aec.gov.au/documents/fA94851\n\n\n--- Page 25 ---\n\nAppendix A \n\nIncoming calls \nIt is important to determine the nature of all calls as a first step. \n\n  The switchboard number receives a fair number of marketing and sales calls.

Take a message. You could say, “I \ncannot transfer your call to the Electoral Commissioner, but I can take a message and \npass it to her/his office for action.” \n\n \n\nIf the caller identifies themselves as a member or senator, executive office holder \n(President, Vice-President, Secretary) of a major political party, or a person from \nanother Government Agency, contact the relevant Executive Assistant in the \nExecutive Area (for a member of ELT) or Branch Project Officer to discuss. \n\nTransferring a call to an internal number \nTo transfer a call to an internal extension number: \n\n■  When you answer a call, your telephone screen will display a button marked ‘Transfer’. \n\nPress the button. \n\n■  Dial the extension number.  \n■  Wait for the ring tone. \n■  Speak to the EA and provide them with the caller details. \n■ \n■  The call is now transferred. \n\nIf they choose to accept the call, press the button marked ‘Transfer’ again and hang up. \n\nTransferring a call \nIf the call is for an AEC help desk, there is no need to announce the caller before transferring the \ncall.

You can also forward the \nswitchboard phone to another area within the AEC if needed. \n\nThese messages are recorded by us. \n\nStandard Business Hours \nA recorded message is automatically activated each working day. Calls will come through to the \nSwitchboard from 9am each business day until 5pm when callers will receive a message to say \nwe are closed. Provided standard business hours don’t change, you will not need to record a \nmessage for this service. \n\nAt election time, calls go directly to the call centre. As the call centre has extended hours, there is \nno need to record another message. When the call centre is closed, callers will hear our standard \nbusiness hours message. \n\nPublic Holidays  \nOn public holidays a message needs to be recorded to advise callers we are closed. The \nmessages to use are provided below. See Appendix E – Changing the recording on the \nSwitchboard phone. \n\nEmergency  \nThe emergency message is used in the event there is an emergency and it is safe for you to \nrecord a new message.  \n\nForwarding the Public Enquiry phone to another area within the AEC \n\nTo transfer calls to another phone while the Public Engagement team is away \n\nTransferring switchboard to an internal number \n\n  Pick up handset on \n\nphone \n\n  On the phone touchscreen, press Fwd Reception (FR) \n\nPage 26    Public Enquiries Handbook |  \nObjective: SD&F > Roll Ops & Client Services > Public Engagement > Public Enquiries > Policy and Procedure, or \nhttps://objective.prod.aec.gov.au/documents/fA94851\n\n\n--- Page 28 ---\n\n  Enter the five-digit number (or any number you want the calls to be forwarded to). You will \n\nhear beeps. \n\n  Put handset down \n\n  Check that phone has been forwarded to the selected phone number by phoning 02 6271 \n\n4411 from another phone. \n\nTo transfer calls back to the switchboard. \n\n  Press ‘Fwd Cancel’ (FC). You will hear beeps. \n\n  Pick up and put handset down \n\n  Check that phone has returned to the PE team by phoning 02 6271 4411 from another \n\nphone. \n\nHow to change the critical incident message \n\nPage 27    Public Enquiries Handbook |  \nObjective: SD&F > Roll Ops & Client Services > Public Engagement > Public Enquiries > Policy and Procedure, or \nhttps://objective.prod.aec.gov.au/documents/fA94851\n\n\n--- Page 29 ---\n\nAppendix C \n\nList of Recorded messages \n\nSwitchboard recorded messages \nTo ensure consistency and professionalism across the AEC, the following voicemail scripts are to \nbe used: \n\nPublic holiday shutdown recorded message (most common message) \n\nThank you for calling the Australian Electoral Commission.  \n\nOur office is currently closed due to the [insert name] public holiday and will re-open at 9am on \n[insert date]. \n\nFor electoral information during this time please visit our website www.aec.gov.au \n\nBusiness message (out of normal hours) \n\nThank you for calling the Australian Electoral Commission. \n\nOur opening hours are between 9am and 5pm, Monday to Friday.
