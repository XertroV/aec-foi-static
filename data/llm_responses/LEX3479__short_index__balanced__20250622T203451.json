LEX3479)\n\n**Main Purpose of the FOI Request:**\nThe Freedom of Information (FOI) request, identified as FOI NO. LEX3479, sought access to meeting minutes of the Electoral Integrity and Assurance Taskforce. The request specifically targeted minutes created between April 10, 2022, and November 10, 2022, focusing on discussions related to breaches of the Electoral Act, encompassing both authorisation and misleading/deceptive breaches.\n\n**Documents from the FOI Request:**\nThe released documents include:\n*   A \"SCHEDULE OF RETRIEVED DOCUMENTS\" listing 24 \"Record of meeting\" documents from the Electoral Integrity and Assurance Taskforce. These records cover meetings held daily, and sometimes twice daily, between May 2, 2022, and May 25, 2022.\n*   The actual meeting records for the dates listed, heavily redacted.\n\n**Main Content Relating to the FOI Request:**\nThe released meeting records are largely redacted under various sections of the FOI Act 1982 (e.g., s 22, s 33, s 47F). However, the unredacted portions reveal consistent discussion of one specific breach type related to the Electoral Act:\n*   **\"Unauthorised Candidate Corflutes\"** in the electoral divisions of Hughes, MacKellar, and Warringah (NSW).\n*   This issue is consistently categorised as a \"Breach of CEA\" (Commonwealth Electoral Act) in the meeting records from May 18 PM, May 19 AM, May 22, May 24, and May 25.\n*   For this particular matter, the \"Key points\" section repeatedly states \"Nil updates,\" and the \"Actions\" column consistently records \"Watching Brief\" for the Electoral Integrity and Assurance Taskforce (EIAT).\n\nDue to the extensive redactions, detailed information regarding other potential breaches or broader discussions of electoral integrity issues is not discernible from the provided documents.\n\nProvide only the markdown formatted summary text. Do not include any conversational filler or preamble."
