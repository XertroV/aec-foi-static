            "text": "The document primarily consists of email correspondence and meeting invitations between the Australian Electoral Commission's (AEC) Defending Democracy Unit (DDU) and Electoral Integrity Assurance Taskforce (EIAT) and representatives from Google and YouTube, spanning from June 2024 to March 2025. It also includes a formal letter from Google to the Acting Electoral Commissioner dated February 24, 2025.\n\n### Summary of Document Content\n\nThe interactions detail ongoing, proactive collaboration focused on safeguarding electoral integrity in anticipation of the 2025 Federal Election (FE25), with a strong emphasis on addressing the challenges posed by generative AI and online misinformation.\n\nKey themes and discussions include:\n\n*   **AI and Generative AI (AIGC):** Extensive focus on Google/YouTube's strategies and policies regarding AI in elections, including lessons learned from the US presidential election. Specific topics cover content provenance/authenticity (e.g., Google's SynthID watermarking), policy responses to AI-related misinformation and deepfakes (e.g., YouTube's misinformation policies, advertiser disclosure requirements for synthetic content, content labels on YouTube, and restrictions on election-related queries in Gemini).\n*   **Misinformation and Disinformation:** Discussions on countering specific misinformation narratives (e.g., promotion by Sovereign Citizen groups) and addressing false claims (e.g., an incorrect Gemini response about voter enrollment, which was subsequently corrected, and a YouTube video falsely claiming digital ID requirements for FE25, which led to channel termination).\n*   **Global Election Learnings:** Regular agenda items for meetings include sharing observations and insights from other 2024 elections worldwide and how these experiences are shaping platform policies and operational work. The AEC also shares its observations and trends in the Australian election information environment.\n*   **Referral and Escalation Pathways:** Confirmation and streamlining of direct communication channels and pathways for the AEC (DDU/EIAT) to flag potential issues and problematic content to Google/YouTube for review and action. A concrete example involves the prompt removal of a YouTube video reported by the AEC for spreading false information about digital ID requirements for FE25.\n*   **Policy Updates and Preparations:** Google/YouTube provides updates on changes to their policy settings (e.g., AI content disclosure) and reiterates their commitment to the \"Tech Accord to Combat Deceptive Use of AI in 2024 Elections.\" They outline their robust measures, including Google Threat Intelligence, machine learning classifiers for policy violations, and free security services (e.g., Advanced Protection Program, Project Shield) for high-risk users like campaigns and journalists.\n*   **Media Literacy and Authoritative Information:** Collaboration on proactive campaigns to surface high-quality, authoritative electoral information. This involves discussions on AEC-specific promotional creatives (e.g., \"How to Vote,\" \"Where to Vote,\" \"AEC Playlist\" on YouTube) and Google/YouTube's own initiatives such as the \"Hit Pause\" media literacy campaign.\n*   **Online Platform Scenarios:** Discussions on updated \"Online Platform Scenarios\" tailored for FE24/25, which serve as a framework for addressing various potential issues and platform responses.\n*   **Safeguarding Electoral Workers:** An agenda item specifically addresses preventing harassment and intimidation of electoral workers, particularly when such content is disseminated online. The AEC also alerts Google to proposed legislative changes concerning recording and publishing from polling places, which could impact content moderation.\n\n### Relevance to the FOI Request\n\nThis document is highly relevant to the FOI request as it directly demonstrates the \"extensive interactions\" and \"detailed collaboration\" between the Australian Electoral Commission and Google/YouTube. It provides concrete evidence of how these platforms are engaging with the AEC's Electoral Integrity Assurance Taskforce (EIAT) and Defending Democracy Unit (DDU) to safeguard electoral integrity ahead of FE25.\n\nSpecifically, it illustrates:\n*   **Proactive Engagement:** A continuous schedule of meetings and correspondence established well in advance of the election.\n*   **Addressing Key Threats:** Direct focus on countering misinformation/disinformation and managing AI-generated content through detection, labeling, provenance initiatives, and policy enforcement.\n*   **Operational Mechanisms:** The establishment and active use of formal referral and escalation pathways, along with discussions on platform policy updates and cybersecurity support.\n*   **Knowledge Exchange:** Mutual sharing of insights from global elections and trends in the Australian information environment.\n*   **Joint Initiatives:** Collaboration on media literacy campaigns and the active promotion of authoritative electoral information.\n\nThe document confirms Google/YouTube's commitment and active preparation for FE25 through their stated policies, dedicated working groups, and direct communication channels, all aimed at ensuring a secure and credible information environment for the upcoming election."

  "prompt": "Considering this document as part of an FOI request, summarize the document and its relevance to the FOI request in markdown format. FYI the overview of the FOI request is: The Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) sought information via an FOI request regarding its engagement with major online platforms—Google/YouTube, Meta (Facebook/Instagram), Microsoft/LinkedIn, and TikTok—to safeguard electoral integrity ahead of the 2025 Federal Election (FE25). The released documents reveal extensive interactions, including meeting invitations, email correspondence, and formal letters, detailing how these platforms are collaborating with the AEC's Electoral Integrity Assurance Taskforce (EIAT) and Defending Democracy Unit (DDU). Key themes include countering misinformation and disinformation, managing AI-generated content (AIGC) like deepfakes through detection, labeling, and provenance initiatives, applying lessons from global elections, streamlining referral and escalation pathways for problematic content, and supporting media literacy campaigns. Each platform is actively preparing for FE25 by updating policies (e.g., AI content disclosure), offering cybersecurity tools, establishing dedicated working groups, and facilitating direct communication channels with the AEC to ensure a secure and credible information environment.\n\nDocument Text:\n\n\n\n--- Page 1 ---\n\nSubject:\nLocation:\n\nStart:\nEnd:\nShow Time As:\n\nCanceled: AEC meeting with Google & YouTube [SEC=OFFICIAL]\nMicrosoft Teams Meeting\n\nMon 16/12/2024 10:00 AM\nMon 16/12/2024 10:30 AM\nFree\n\nRecurrence:\n\n(none)\n\nMeeting Status:\n\nNot yet responded\n\nOrganiser:\nRequired Attendees:\n\nOptional Attendees:\n\nDefending Democracy Unit\n\n Matthew Haigh\n\nImportance:\n\nHigh\n\nHi \n\n and \n\nAs discussed, pu(cid:427)ng this (cid:415)me in the calendar for a post-US elec(cid:415)on, pre-Christmas check-in.  \n\nAgenda items/follow up for discussion to include: \n\n  A debrief on Google’s approach to AI in elections after gaining insight from the US presidential \n\nelection on 5 November \n\n  Content provenance/authenticity and how it works on content uploaded to YouTube  \n  Google and YouTube to provide information and insights into Sovereign Citizen promotion of \n\nmisinformation/disinformation respective platforms \n\n  Google and YouTube support for the next Australian federal election \n  AEC to share trends in the election information environment with Google and YouTube \n\nKind regards, \n\n________________________________________________________________________________ \n\nMicrosoft Teams Need help?  \n\nJoin the meeting now  \n\nMeeting ID: \n\nPasscode:\n\nFor organizers: Meeting options  \n\n1\n\ns47Fs47Fs47Fs47Fs47Fs47Es47Es22\n\n\n--- Page 2 ---\n\nTo help p o ect y ou  p iv acy  M c osoft Off ce p ev ented au omat c download of th s pictu e f om the Inte net\n\nThis meeting invitation was generated by the AEC Microsoft Teams instance \n\n________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n2\n\n\n--- Page 3 ---\n\nFrom:\nSent:\nTo:\nCc:\nSubject:\n\nGood morning \n\n, \n\nThursday, 18 July 2024 9:03 AM\n\nDefending Democracy Unit; \nConfirming meeting scheduled for 24 July | AEC & Google [SEC=OFFICIAL]\n\n; \n\nThanks for getting back to us.

We appreciate the \nAustralian Electoral Commission's (AEC) ongoing collaboration with online platforms and share your commitment to \nmaintaining public trust in Australia's democratic processes. Google recognises the potential risks AI poses to electoral \nintegrity and welcomes the opportunity to provide an update on our efforts to address these challenges. \n\nGoogle has long been dedicated to supporting democratic processes by: \n\n●  Surfacing high-quality information to voters \n●  Safeguarding our platforms from abuse, and \n●  Equipping campaigns with best-in-class security tools and training. \n\nThese three pillars are fundamental to maintaining public trust in elections and include our platforms and services \nproviding the following: \n\n●  Google promotes information on how to vote on Google Search's landing page to increase voter awareness \n\nand democratic participation. \n\n●  YouTube prominently surfaces content from authoritative sources on the homepage, in search results, and the \n\n\"Up Next\" panel for election news and information. \n\n●  Google monitors and tackles coordinated influence operations through the Google Threat Intelligence group, \nwhich includes intelligence and threat response across Google’s Threat Analysis Group, Cloud Security and \nMandiant teams. \n\n●  For over a decade, Google has leveraged machine learning classifiers and AI to identify and remove content \n\nthat violates policies regarding manipulated media, hate and harassment, incitement to violence, and \ndemonstrably false claims that could undermine democratic processes. \n\n●  Google offers free security services like the Advanced Protection Program and Project Shield to high-risk users \nsuch as campaigners and journalists to ensure they have additional account security protections in place. \n\nAddressing AI-Related Misinformation \n\nWe understand the AEC's concerns regarding the use of AI to spread election-related misinformation and \ndisinformation, including deepfakes and coordinated inauthentic behaviour. Google has implemented several \nmeasures to mitigate these risks across our products and services: \n\n●  AI and Generative AI policies: Google has policies that address misinformation and disinformation in the \ncontext of AI.  For example, YouTube's misinformation policies prohibit technically manipulated content that \nmisleads users and could pose a serious risk of egregious harm.  \n\n Page 1 of 3\n\n\n--- Page 38 ---\n\n●  Ads disclosures: Google requires advertisers to disclose when their election ads include synthetic content \nthat inauthentically depicts real or realistic-looking people or events. This policy applies to image, video, and \naudio content. Google's ads policies already prohibit the use of manipulated media to mislead people, such as \ndeep fakes or doctored content. \n\n●  Content labels on YouTube: YouTube requires creators to disclose when they've created realistic altered or \nsynthetic content and displays a label indicating that the content is synthetic. For election-related content, \nYouTube displays a prominent label on the video player for added transparency. \n\n●  Responsible approach to Generative AI products: Google has prioritised testing across safety risks, \nincluding misinformation, for Generative AI products like Gemini. Google has restricted the types of \nelection-related queries for which Gemini will return responses. \n\n●  Watermarking: Google attaches invisible watermarks to imagery generated by Google's models using \n\nSynthID, a watermarking technology developed by Google DeepMind. \n\n●  Providing users with additional context: \"About this image\" in Search helps people assess the credibility and \ncontext of images found online. The double-check feature in Gemini enables people to evaluate whether \nthere's content across the web to substantiate a Gemini response. \n\nProgress Against the Tech Accord Commitments \n\nGoogle was among the original signatories of the Tech Accord to Combat Deceptive Use of AI in 2024 Elections. In line \nwith our commitments, we have taken steps across our products to reduce the risks that deceptive AI election content \nmay pose to the integrity of electoral processes. These steps include: \n\n●  Developing Model Cards to promote transparency and a shared understanding of AI models \n●  Addressing harmful content through Google's AI Prohibited Use Policy \n●  Proactively testing systems using AI-Assisted Red Teaming \n●  Restricting responses for election-related queries across many Generative AI consumer apps and experiences \n●  Expanding the SynthID watermarking toolkit to more Generative AI tools and more forms of media \n●  Requiring election advertisers to prominently disclose when their ads include realistic synthetic content \n●  Adding Google-generated disclosures for some YouTube Election Ads formats, and \n●  Actively exploring ways to incorporate Content Credentials into our own products and services, including Ads, \n\nSearch, and YouTube, as a Steering Committee member of the C2PA Coalition and Standard. \n\nCollaboration and Transparency \n\nGoogle is committed to transparency and collaboration with industry, government, and civil society. We actively share \nour learnings and expertise with researchers and others in the industry. We engage and collaborate with organisations \nsuch as the Partnership on AI, ML Commons, and the Frontier Model Forum. We also support the Global Fact Check \nFund and numerous civil society, research, and media literacy efforts. \n\nLooking Ahead \n\nGoogle's efforts around elections are not limited to a specific timeframe or region. We will continue to support and \nprotect elections around the world and in Australia by: \n\n●  Surfacing high-quality information to voters \n●  Safeguarding our platforms from abuse \n●  Equipping campaigns with best-in-class security tools and training \n●  Applying new learnings to improve our protections for harmful content and create trustworthy experiences \n●  Leveraging machine learning classifiers and AI to identify and remove content that violates our policies, and \n●  Taking a principled and responsible approach to introducing generative AI products. \n\n Page 2 of 3\n\n\n--- Page 39 ---\n\nWe are dedicated to working with the AEC to address the challenges posed by Al and uphold the Australian public's\ntrust in democratic processes and institutions. We value our ongoing relationship and have welcomed the frequent\nand ongoing engagement with members of the AEC from the Defending Democracy Unit and beyond. We will continue\nto work closely with the AEC to ensure these efforts are understood and that appropriate pathways for escalation and\nengagement are in place ahead of the upcoming Federal Election.\n\nWe look forward to continuing our collaboration.\n\n   \n\nSincerely,\nGovernment Affairs and Public Policy Government Affairs and Public Policy\n\nPage 3 of 3\n\n\n--- Page 40 ---\n\nFrom:\nSent:\nTo:\nCc:\nSubject:\n\nHi \n\n, \n\nMonday, 9 December 2024 10:36 AM\n\nRE: Action items from October meeting, including proposed dates for December \nmeeting [SEC=OFFICIAL]\n\nThanks for your reply.

I thought it \nwould be good to follow up on a few action items from our last meeting before December arrives, as \nfollows. \n\nInformation session \n\n \n\n- at our last meeting you kindly offered to set up an information quality session to outline how \nGoogle search worked, including an element on searches in Gemini. We would like to take you up \non that offer.  \n\no  Please let me know what time frames/notice you need to set this up and I would be happy \n\nto set up some meeting invites \n\no  If we work a couple of weeks in advance, most of our working level attendees will be free to \n\nattend \n\nGemini’s incorrect answer about enrolling to vote \n\n \n\n- on 23 October we flagged that Gemini was producing an incorrect answer to the question \n“Can I be enrolled to vote if I haven’t completed and enrolment form?”. It appears that Gemini \nnow declines to respond this prompt, instead providing the scripted answer in relation to not \nbeing able to help with elections. I’m not sure if this is based on action you have taken in the \nbackground, if so, thanks and noted! \n\n  For a gold star from us it would be great if Gemini provided a link to the AEC’s website when \n\nAustralian users submit queries about elections, although there is some nuance to this given we \nhave state electoral management bodies to consider too. We also understand these things are not \nalways as easy as they sound. Happy to discuss at our next meeting if this is something you think \ncould be pursued. \n\nNext meeting - December 2024 \n\n  At our last meeting on 23 October, it was agreed it would be useful to set up a post US election \n\nmeeting before we all break for Christmas. Available times in December include: \n\no  Monday, 16 December                   9.30am to 11.00am \no  Monday, 16 December                   1pm to 2pm \n\n3\n\ns47Fs47Fs47Fs47F\n\n\n--- Page 43 ---\n\no  Tuesday, 17 December                   1pm to 2pm \no  Wednesday, 18 December            9.30am to 10.30am \no  Wednesday, 18 December            1pm to 2pm \no  Friday, 20 December                       9.30am to 12pm \no  Friday, 20 December                       1pm to 2pm \n\nNo problem if this is not a good week in the lead up to Christmas, just give me a steer on a better \nweek and I’ll consult calendars accordingly. \n\n  We will send out an agenda prior the next meeting but note the following from our last meeting. \n\no \n\no \n\n offered to brief on Google’s approach to AI in elections after gaining insight from \n\nthe US presidential election on 5 November \n\n offered to provide more information about how content provenance works on \n\ncontent uploaded to YouTube at next meeting \n\no  Google and YouTube to provide information and insights into Sovereign Citizen promotion \n\nof misinformation/disinformation respective platforms \n\no  Google and YouTube support for the next Australian federal election \no  AEC to share trends in the election information environment with Google and YouTube \n\nLastly, no doubt you are already aware of the Electoral Legislation Amendment (Electoral Reform) Bill \n2024 currently being considered. In case you are not already aware, there is a proposed amendment to \nsection 348 (Control of behaviour at polling booths etc.) of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 that \nprovides: \n\n(1A) A person commits an offence if:  \n\n(a)          the person makes an audio or video recording in premises to which this section \napplies; and \n\n(b)          the recording is made without the permission of the person in charge of the \npremises; and  \n\n(c)           the making of the recording constitutes a contravention of paragraph 348(1)(a); \nand  \n\n(d)          the person:  \n\n(i)            publishes the whole or a part of the recording; or  \n\n(ii)           causes to be published the whole or a part of the recording.  \n\nPenalty: 5 penalty units. \n\n4\n\ns47Fs47F\n\n\n--- Page 44 ---\n\nEssentially, it will be an offence to get your phone out and video or audio record in a polling place or \ncounting centre and post it online without the permission of the officer in charge. Some of the content \nposted online that the AEC was concerned about during past events would be covered by this if/when it \nenacted. Flagging now ahead of our next meeting for discussion. \n\nApologies for the lengthy email.
