Analyze how the document reflects or contradicts the values of reason, individualism, and free enterprise. Note any evidence of bureaucratic obstacles, forced altruism, or suppression of productive achievement.\n\nTo aid you, the overview of the FOI request is: [REQUEST OVERVIEW START] The Australian Electoral Commission's actions, as revealed in these FOI documents, represent a profound betrayal of individual rights and rational self-interest, serving as a stark example of government overreach that stifles productive achievement. Its demonstrably irrational methodologies for assessing party membership, which statistically ensure \"false negatives\" and arbitrary limits on submissions, actively punish the diligent, voluntary effort of individuals to organize and build political movements. This contempt for reason, evidenced by the AEC's dismissal of objective statistical analysis and its self-serving justifications, transforms it from a neutral administrator of objective law into an instrument of state control. Such paternalistic interference, including arbitrary restrictions on party identity and the denial of essential data, fundamentally undermines personal freedom, suppresses initiative and competition, and effectively entrenches the political status quo, thereby violating the principles of individual liberty and objective justice upon which a free society depends.\n [REQUEST OVERVIEW END] \n\n--- MAIN DOCUMENT TEXT START ---\n\n\n\n--- Page 1 ---\n\nRequest for: \n\nLEX3070 FOI REQUEST \n\nall applications made to the Australian Electoral Commission under s 141 (2) of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 during the year 2022 prior to \n21st June 2022. \n\nSCHEDULE OF PUBLISHED DOCUMENTS \n\nPage 1 of 2\n\n\n--- Page 2 ---\n\n1 \n\n2 \n\n3 \n\n4 \n\n5 \n\n6 \n\n7 \n\n8 \n\n9 \n\nDocument \nNo. \n\nDescription \n\n  Email re Notice under s 134(6)(c) of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 \n\n(Electoral Act) - Australian Federation Party \n\n  Letter re Request for Review of Decision.  \n\n  Letter re Request for Review of Decision to Deregister Flux \n\n  Email re Request for review of the deregistration of VOTEFLUX.ORG \n\nWithheld pending exhaustion of third party review rights. \n\nDate \n\n11/03/2022 \n7:17 PM \n\n31/03/2022 \n\n14/04/2022 \n(date of receipt) \n\n26/04/2022 \n12:03 AM \n\n  Email re Please review your recent decision to deregister flux party. \n\n06/05/2022 \n\n  Email re Application under s 141(2) regarding Health Australia Party \n\n05/05/2022 \n\n  Email re Attention Mr Tom Rogers  \n\n  Email re request for internal review \n\n  Letter re internal review of the AECâ€™s decision to deregister the Australian \n\nProgressives \n\nEnd \n\n8/04/2022 \n10:50 AM \n\n11/04/2022 \n\n16/03/2022 \n(date or receipt) \n\nPage 2 of 2\n\nProvide only the markdown formatted summary text.
