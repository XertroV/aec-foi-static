            "text": "The provided FOI documents reveal significant shortcomings in the Australian Electoral Commission's (AEC) methodology for verifying political party membership, suggesting potential inefficiency, questionable decision-making, and a lack of transparency.\n\n1.  **Statistically Flawed Testing Methodology:** The AEC's initial method for assessing \"VoteFlux.Org | Upgrade Democracy!\" party membership was fundamentally unsound. Instead of randomly sampling the party's full list of 4,680 names, the AEC selectively tested only the \"top 1,650 names.\" The Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS), the government's own statistical authority, explicitly confirmed this approach was invalid, stating it was \"not possible to draw any meaningful statistical conclusions about the Party’s whole list\" from such a biased \"sub-list.\" This indicates a striking lack of basic statistical competence within the AEC or a deliberate choice to employ a flawed method.\n2.  **Increased Risk of Unjustified Deregistration:** The ABS advice further clarified that failing to adopt the correct, larger sample size (estimated at 564 for the full 4,680 names) significantly increases the \"likelihood of false rejection.\" This directly implies that the AEC's flawed initial assessment likely led to an unfair deregistration decision against \"VoteFlux.Org | Upgrade Democracy!\", demonstrating a systemic flaw that could unfairly target smaller or newer political entities.\n3.  **Opacified Information and Limited Transparency:** While some documents are published, key advice from the ABS on sampling and methodology (Document 5) is only \"Access in Part\" due to \"47F\" exemptions. Furthermore, the main correspondence contains multiple redactions under sections \"47F\" and \"47FS.\" This selective release of information and reliance on broad exemptions obstructs full public scrutiny of the government's decision-making processes and the precise advice guiding critical actions like party deregistration.\n4.  **Shifting Blame and Justifying Stringent Oversight:** The ABS's comment about \"incentives of parties to keep good records\" and discouraging \"large low quality lists\" can be interpreted as the government placing the onus on parties to meet high, potentially burdensome, administrative standards, rather than ensuring the government's own verification methods are competent and fair. This framing potentially deflects from the AEC's internal methodological deficiencies."

At that meeting we discussed the ABS \n\nThank you for meeting with \nmethodology for sampling and testing membership of political parties used by the AEC. You kindly reviewed some \nquestions we had and considered some issues raised by applications for review of the decision to deregister \nVoteFlux.Org | Upgrade Democracy! (the Party). The purpose of this email is to summarise the key points raised in \nthat discussion. I would be grateful if you could confirm that I have set out your advice correctly. If not, I would be \ngrateful if you could edit the response or reply clarify any points.  \n\nIf possible, we would be grateful for your response by Monday 1 July 2022. We may provide this information to the \nElectoral Commission for the purposes of their review of the decision to deregister the Party. \n\n1. What conclusions can be drawn in relation to the list of 4680 names in the Party’s list, following the delegate’s \ndecision to test the top 1,650 names of that list (the sub-list)? \n\nWith respect to the test conducted it is not the randomisation or not that is causing the false rejection (or false \nacceptance) rate to land outside the limits. It is the sample size that control the test conditions. If you had \nrandomised you would have been able to say something about the whole list as the final sample (probabilistically) \nwould have referred to the 4680 not just the 1650. Nevertheless you still would have needed a bigger sample size to \nget the desired risk rates.  \n\nYou advised that as the Party’s list was not randomised before the sub-list was made (as only the top 1650 names \nwere selected) it is not possible to draw any meaningful statistical conclusions about the Party’s whole list of 4680 \nfrom the results of testing the sub-list. You can only say something about the selected 1650. This is because, without \nrandomisation there is no chance of the other records being selected. You explained this by the analogy of \nattempting to sample from a deck of cards for aces. Having failed to first shuffle the deck, chunking the bottom half \naway, and then sample from what is left will not give you useful information about all original cards. Those thrown \naway were never in the running. \n\nThe test done indicates a list with low proportion of eligible members among the 1650. \n\nDELETE As would usually be the case, as the test of the sub-list failed, it is possible to conclude (to the level of \nconfidence to which the test is set) that the sub-list of 1,650 did not include 1,500 members.  \n\n2. What are the alternative options for testing the larger list? \n\nYou explained that a larger sample size would be required to test a large list to the same degree of confidence. \nCurrent sampling is calibrated so that the probability of accepting an invalid list is less than 2%, and the probability \nof falsely rejecting a valid list is less than 6%. You estimated that the sample size required to test the full list of 4680 \nnames would be over 300. You also advised that excel spreadsheet calculator provided to the AEC could provide \ninformation about the sample size required to test a list of 4680 names to different levels of confidence.  \n\nWe have now used the calculator (attached), to calculate that sampling a list of 4680 members, where the desired \nprobability of false rejection is 6% and the desired probability of false acceptance is 2%, would require an \napproximate sample size of 564 and a maximum number of denials allowed of 399.     \n\n3. Does filtering names affect the error rates? \n\nYou explained that in your view, the arguments made in \n paper with respect to filtering names increasing \nthe error rate are without foundation. You explained that, provided the filtering process is done in accordance with \nthe ABS methodology, filtering names works in favour of parties by removing from a list members who would not \nhave been capable of meeting the requirements.  \n\nCorrect this would improve the ‘quality’ of the list and decrease the occurrence of finding denials (non-members) in \nthe list sample. \n\n4\n\nsection 47FS 47F\n\n\n--- Page 5 ---\n\n4. Your general comments on \n\n paper \n\n hypothetical example. That example \nYou considered that it was not instructive to consider in depth \nstarted from the premise that the party has more than 1,500 and sought to prove that a specific list could be \nrejected by the sampling methodology.  \n\nYou agreed with the general proposition that if the correct sampling size was not adopted in relation to a larger list, \nthe likelihood of false rejection increased. This is shown by the calculator.  \n\nWe also discussed generally the rationale for requiring a smaller sampling size as a practical and fair method for \ntesting party lists. We discussed the difficulties of testing a larger list.  Since the requirement is minimum 1500 a \nparty with a very large list that is ‘low quality’ in the sense that it contains a high percentage of non-members will \nrequire a very big sample size to control false rejection risks. This relates to the incentives of parties to keep good \nrecords of their members and provide the AEC with a high quality list. Providing large low quality lists should be \ndiscouraged.  \n\nLegal Services Section | Legal & Procurement Branch \nAustralian Electoral Commission \n\nDISCLAIMER: \n\nIf you have received this transmission in error please notify us immediately by return email and delete all copies.
