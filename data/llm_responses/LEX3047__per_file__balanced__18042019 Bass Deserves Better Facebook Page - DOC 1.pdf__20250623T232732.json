The complainant requests the AEC to determine if the page requires authorisation and to contact the group to address the non-compliance.\n\n**Relevance to FOI Request:** This document directly aligns with the FOI request LEX3047, which covers AEC documents regarding complaints in April-May 2019 about electoral advertisements lacking authorisation or being misleading. The complaint specifically targets \"Bass Deserves Better\" for its absence of authorisation and misleading \"community group\" portrayal, echoing the core themes of the FOI request."

Do not include any conversational filler or preamble.To aid you, the overview of the FOI request is: [REQUEST OVERVIEW START] FOI Request LEX3047 obtained Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) documents concerning complaints made primarily in April and May 2019 about electoral advertisements lacking authorisation or being misleading. The released materials include public email complaints and the AEC's responses to various entities like \"Our Vote Our Community\" and \"Bass Deserves Better\" Facebook pages, \"RiteOn!\" website, and other media. The complaints predominantly highlighted the absence of required authorisation details on political advertising across digital and print platforms, with some also raising concerns about misleading \"community group\" portrayals or unauthorised paid ads. In response, the AEC consistently clarified 'electoral matter' and authorisation requirements under the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918, requested subjects to add necessary authorisations, cease distribution of non-compliant materials, and advised on potential penalties up to $25,200 for non-compliance, as well as obligations for \"disclosure entities.\"\n [REQUEST OVERVIEW END] \n\n--- MAIN DOCUMENT TEXT START ---\n\n\n\n--- Page 1 ---\n\nFrom:\nTo:\nSubject:\nDate:\nAttachments:\n\n@icloud.com\n\nLegal Services Mailbox\n[COMPLAINT Political advertising] \nThursday, 18 April 2019 9:17:19 AM\n[Attachment 01]\n\nh.jpg\n\n() *WWW* [SEC=UNCLASSIFIED]\n\nComplaint\n\nCategory\n\nPolitical advertising\n\nPrimary Details\n\nGiven name(s):\n\nSurname:\n\nOrganisation:\n\nEmail:\n\nPhone number:\n\nElectoral division:\n\nComplaint Details\n\nThere is a social media page on Facebook named \"Bass Deserves Better\", posting \nand sharing union political messages. the page is run by a known senior union \n' (who is a Industrial Organiser at CPSU Tasmania) , as found \nmember \nby scrolling through hundreds of posts I found that \n was running it.
