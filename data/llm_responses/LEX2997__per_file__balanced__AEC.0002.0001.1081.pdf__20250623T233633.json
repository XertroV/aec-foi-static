The article alleges Laming used \"dummy\" Facebook pages, disguised as community or news groups, to promote political content and attack opponents without mandatory electoral authorisation disclosures. Sent by Alex Morris to AEC legal personnel, including Louise Parrott from the Electoral Authorisation Section, the communication highlights the specific allegations and notes that the AEC anticipates public complaints or inquiries as a result of the media report.\n\n**Relevance to FOI Request:** This document is highly relevant as it demonstrates the AEC's immediate internal reaction and awareness of the specific media reports and public allegations that directly triggered its investigation into Andrew Laming's Facebook pages for compliance with federal electoral authorisation laws, as described in the FOI request overview. It shows the initial point of contact for the AEC with the specific allegations."

Do not include any conversational filler or preamble.To aid you, the overview of the FOI request is: [REQUEST OVERVIEW START] The FOI request disclosed documents detailing the Australian Electoral Commission's (AEC) investigation into Andrew Laming MP's Facebook pages for compliance with federal electoral authorisation laws. This inquiry was triggered by public complaints and media reports, notably from *The Guardian*, alleging Laming used numerous pages (e.g., \"Redland Bay Bulletin,\" \"Redlands Institute\") disguised as community or news groups to promote political content and attack opponents without mandatory disclosures. The AEC confirmed an active investigation, noting 2018 Electoral Act amendments broadened social media authorisation, and issued formal notices to Laming for detailed information and to third parties (like Facebook) for data, with Facebook confirming its cooperation. Findings revealed some pages were removed or updated with authorisation, while others remained active and unauthorised.\n [REQUEST OVERVIEW END] \n\n--- MAIN DOCUMENT TEXT START ---\n\n\n\n--- Page 1 ---\n\nAEC.0002.0001.1081\n\nFrom:                                 Louise ParrottSent:                                  Tue, 6 Apr 2021 16:04:10 +1000To:                                      Alex MorrisCc:                                      Justin SowdenSubject:                             RE: Guardian article re Mr Laming and unauthorised Facebook pages [SEC=OFFICIAL]Hi Alex, Thanks for the heads up! Louise Louise Parrott | Principal Government Lawyer Electoral Authorisation Section | Legal & Procurement BranchAustralian Electoral CommissionT: (02) 6271 4447 X: 21750  From: Alex Morris <Alex.Morris@aec.gov.au> Sent: Tuesday, 6 April 2021 3:13 PMTo: Andrew Johnson <Andrew.Johnson@aec.gov.au>; Louise Parrott <Louise.Parrott@aec.gov.au>Cc: Evan Ekin-Smyth <Evan.Ekin-Smyth@aec.gov.au>; Mark Batistich <Mark.Batistich@aec.gov.au>; Isabella McCormick <Isabella.McCormick@aec.gov.au>Subject: Guardian article re Mr Laming and unauthorised Facebook pages [SEC=OFFICIAL] Hi legal eagles (and hello Louise),  Guardian Australia has just published an article on several ‘dummy’ Facebook pages created and/or run by Andrew Laming. Drawing to your attention as the article contains the following:  The Bowman MP, who is on leave from parliament to undertake empathy counselling following complaints about his behaviour towards women, uses the sites to promote political material and attack his Labor opponents through pages classified with Facebook as “community” and “news” groups. None of the pages include political authorisation disclosures. According to the Australian Electoral Commission, political authorisation is required for “information that is a matter communicated, or intended to be communicated, for the dominant purpose of influencing the way electors vote in a federal election”. Evan is out today but my understanding is the AEC was not approached for comment prior to this article being published.  No action required at this stage, but I would expect this to trigger some complaints or enquiries.\n\n\n--- Page 2 ---\n\n\n\n"
