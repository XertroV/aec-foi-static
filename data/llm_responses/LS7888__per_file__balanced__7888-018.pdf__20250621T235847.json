            "text": "### Document Summary\n\nThis document is an email exchange from December 2018 between several Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) staff members, including Guy Lewis, Michael Roden, and Delyse Paliaga. The core discussion revolves around a parliamentary statement made by MP Warren Snowden on 3 December 2018, claiming that \"in 2014 the AEC had already identified that 42 per cent of Indigenous people were not enrolled to vote\" (implying 58% enrolment).\n\n*   Michael Roden confirms that this 2014 figure likely represents the \"first cut\" of Indigenous enrolment rates, which was tentatively trialled around four years prior (circa 2014) and \"solely using regression methods.\"\n*   He explicitly states that \"Many methodological changes since then\" have occurred, leading to a \"general improvement in enrolment rates.\"\n*   Guy Lewis confirms that this 2014 figure was cited in a 2015 Australian National Audit Office (ANAO) report.\n*   The exchange highlights the AEC's internal discussion and clarification regarding historical Indigenous enrolment rate estimates derived from an earlier methodology.\n\n### Relevance to FOI Request LS7888\n\nThis document is highly relevant to FOI request LS7888, which sought information on the AEC's *new* methodology for the Indigenous Electoral Participation Program (IEPP) in 2018-2019.\n\n*   **Context for Methodological Shift:** The FOI overview states that the AEC \"transitioned to a more direct method for estimating Indigenous electoral enrolment rates,\" increasing estimates from \"approximately 58% (under the old 2014 methodology)\" to over 76% by 2018-2019. This document directly corroborates and provides internal AEC confirmation for the \"old 2014 methodology\" figure of 58% enrolment (42% unenrolled).\n*   **Acknowledgement of Methodological Evolution:** Michael Roden's comment about \"many methodological changes since then\" explicitly acknowledges the evolution of the AEC's approach to estimating Indigenous enrolment rates, which is central to the FOI request's focus on the \"new methodology.\"\n*   **Historical Data Point:** By confirming the source and nature of the 2014 enrolment estimate (regression-based and cited in a 2015 ANAO report), the document provides crucial historical context against which the impact and outcomes of the new methodology (Centrelink data-driven) can be understood.\n*   While it does not detail the planning, implementation, Indigenous involvement, or specific costs of the *new* methodology, it solidifies the understanding of the baseline from which the AEC began its improvements in Indigenous electoral participation estimation."

  "prompt": "Considering this document as part of an FOI request, summarize the document and its relevance to the FOI request in markdown format. FYI the overview of the FOI request is: FOI request LS7888 sought documents from 2018-2019 concerning the Australian Electoral Commission's (AEC) new methodology for its Indigenous Electoral Participation Program (IEPP), specifically regarding its planning, implementation, outcomes, Indigenous involvement, and costs. The released documents reveal the AEC transitioned to a more direct method for estimating Indigenous electoral enrolment rates, primarily by utilising self-identified Indigeneity data from Centrelink. This shift, driven by the availability of new Centrelink data, significantly increased estimated Indigenous enrolment rates from approximately 58% (under the old 2014 methodology) to 76.4% by June 2018 and 76.6% by June 2019. The documents detail the new methodology, its impact, and efforts to track enrolment stimulation, including identifying over 72,000 potentially unenrolled Indigenous Australians in mid-2018 and subsequent enrolment events. However, the released content did not explicitly detail the number of Indigenous people involved in the methodology's development or its final costs and dedicated AEC staffing.\n\nDocument Text:\n\n\n\n--- Page 1 ---\n\nOwen Jones\n\nFrom:\nSent:\nTo:\nSubject:\n\nGuy Lewis\nWednesday, 5 December 2018 8:43 AM\nMichael Roden\nRE: Parliamentary review 3 December 2018 [SEC=UNCLASSIFIED]\n\nYes I found it cited in the 2015 ANAO report \n\nGuy \n\nFrom: Michael Roden  \nSent: Wednesday, 5 December 2018 8:20 AM \nTo: Guy Lewis  \nSubject: RE: Parliamentary review 3 December 2018 [SEC=UNCLASSIFIED] \n\nGuy, I think that reflects the first cut of the Indigenous enrolment rates we tentatively trialled 4 (?) years ago, solely \nusing regression methods. Many methodological changes since then, plus a general improvement in enrolment \nrates. \n\nCheers \n\nm. \n\nFrom: Guy Lewis <Guy.Lewis@aec.gov.au>  \nSent: Tuesday, 4 December 2018 9:17 AM \nTo: Michael Roden <Michael.Roden@aec.gov.au> \nSubject: FW: Parliamentary review 3 December 2018 [SEC=UNCLASSIFIED] \n\nMichael, are you able to shed light on the following statement by Warren Snowden (Lingiari) in parliament \nyesterday? Do you recall where this statement might have come from? \n\n‘in 2014 the AEC had already identified that 42 per cent of Indigenous people were not enrolled to vote.’ \n\nRegards \n\nguy \n\nFrom: Delyse Paliaga <Delyse.Paliaga@aec.gov.au>  \nSent: Tuesday, 4 December 2018 9:12 AM \nTo: Guy Lewis <Guy.Lewis@aec.gov.au>; Darryl Miller <darryl.miller@aec.gov.au> \nCc: Jaime Garrido <Jaime.Garrido@aec.gov.au>; Sarah Gowty <Sarah.Gowty@aec.gov.au>; Robyn Legg \n<Robyn.Legg@aec.gov.au> \nSubject: FW: Parliamentary review 3 December 2018 [SEC=UNCLASSIFIED] \n\nHi Guy and Darryl \n\nGuy are you able to check the figures re enrolment that Mr Snowden quotes in his speech below? \nDarryl do you have any comments on Mr Snowdens speech. \n\nDelyse \n\nDelyse Paliaga | Director Roll Program and Community Engagement  \nRoll Management & Community Engagement Branch \nAustralian Electoral Commission \n\n1\n\nLS7888 Released Document No. 18Released under the Freedom of Information Act 1982\n\n\n--- Page 2 ---\n\nReleased under the Freedom of Information Act 1982\n\n\n--- Page 3 ---\n\nReleased under the Freedom of Information Act 1982\n\n\n--- Page 4 ---\n\nReleased under the Freedom of Information Act 1982\n\n\n--- Page 5 ---\n\nReleased under the Freedom of Information Act 1982\n\n\n--- Page 6 ---\n\nREDACTION CODES \n\nPersonal Information (name) redacted. \n\nPersonal Information (date of birth) redacted. \n\nPersonal Information (photograph) redacted \n\nPersonal Information (facsimile of signature) redacted. \n\nPersonal Information (facsimile of manuscript initialling) redacted. \n\nPersonal Information (Individual’s address) redacted. \n\nPersonal Information (individual’s telephone number) redacted. \n\nPersonal Information (individual’s opinion) redacted. \n\nPersonal Information (opinion about individual) redacted. \n\nPersonal Information (employment history) redacted. \n\nPersonal Information (qualifications) redacted. \n\nPersonal Information (health) redacted. \n\nPersonal Information (identifying individual) redacted. \n\nBusiness information (Bank Account details) redacted. \n\nBusiness information (Billing Account details) redacted. \n\nBusiness information (internal operations) redacted. \n\nLegal Professional Communication redacted. \n\nDeliberative material redacted. \n\nIrrelevant material redacted. \n\nElectoral Roll material redacted. \n\nTests, examinations or audits material redacted. \n\nManagement or assessment of personnel material redacted. \n\nProper and efficient conduct of the operations of AEC material redacted. \n\nLawful methods or procedures for preventing, detecting, investigating, or \ndealing with matters arising out of, breaches or evasions of the law. \n\nTrade Secrets. \n\nCommercial valuable information. \n\nFinancial interests of the Commonwealth. \n\nProperty interests of the Commonwealth. \n\n1 \n\n2 \n\n3 \n\n4 \n\n5 \n\n6 \n\n7 \n\n8 \n\n9 \n\n10 \n\n11 \n\n12 \n\n13 \n\n14 \n\n15 \n\n16 \n\n17 \n\n18 \n\n19 \n\n20 \n\n21 \n\n22 \n\n23 \n\n24 \n\n25 \n\n26 \n\n27 \n\n28\n\nProvide only the markdown formatted summary text.
