Triggered by public complaints and media reports, notably from *The Guardian*, the inquiry focused on numerous pages (e.g., \"Redland Bay Bulletin,\" \"Redlands Institute\") reportedly disguised as community or news groups used to promote political content and attack opponents without mandatory disclosures. The investigation leveraged 2018 Electoral Act amendments broadening social media authorisation. The AEC issued formal notices to Laming for information and to third parties like Facebook for data, with Facebook confirming cooperation. Findings indicated that while some pages were subsequently removed or updated with authorisation disclosures, others remained active and unauthorised.\n\n### Relevance to FOI Request\n\nThis document is directly relevant to the FOI request as it constitutes the disclosed information concerning the AEC's active investigation into Andrew Laming MP. It provides specifics on the allegations (unauthorised political content disguised as community pages), the legal framework (2018 Electoral Act amendments), the investigative steps taken (notices to Laming and Facebook), and the interim outcomes (some pages corrected, others remaining non-compliant). The document confirms the scope and findings of the AEC's inquiry, fulfilling the FOI request's purpose of detailing this investigation."
