  "prompt": "From a left-leaning perspective, provide a concise, single-paragraph summary in markdown format of the following FOI request overview:\n\nSummary:\n\nThe Freedom of Information documents reveal a concerning shift in the Australian government's approach to overseas voting, particularly evident in New Zealand, which significantly impacts civil liberties and aligns poorly with progressive values related to social justice and equitable access to democratic processes.\n\n**Civil Liberties and Social Justice (Voter Access and Enfranchisement):**\nThe most striking revelation is the decision to cease offering in-person voting at the Australian High Commission in Wellington, New Zealand, for the 2022 federal election. Data shows that while 667 Australians cast in-person votes in Wellington in 2019, this number dropped to zero in 2022, with voters forced to rely solely on postal votes (800 received). This represents a direct reduction in voter access and a potential barrier to enfranchisement for a significant number of citizens abroad who previously preferred or relied on in-person voting.\n\nIn stark contrast, the Australian Consulate-General in Auckland continued to offer in-person voting in 2022 (749 votes), alongside postal voting. This creates an inequitable two-tiered system for Australian citizens within the same country, where access to voting rights is contingent on their specific location. From a social justice perspective, this disparity is problematic, as it does not ensure consistent and equitable access to the fundamental right to vote for all citizens, regardless of their proximity to a High Commission or Consulate.\n\nFurthermore, the overall number of postal votes returned directly to the AEC from New Zealand addresses saw a dramatic decrease in 2022 (360) compared to previous elections (1,389 in 2019, 1,309 in 2016). When combined with the elimination of in-person voting in Wellington, this suggests a net reduction in the overall participation of Australians in New Zealand, or at least a significant shift to less accessible methods, potentially leading to disenfranchisement for those unable or unwilling to navigate the postal system.\n\n**Government Actions and Progressive Values:**\nThe internal DFAT Minute, though heavily redacted, indicates that the decision to differentiate between High Commissions and Consulates-General, restricting in-person voting at the former, was a deliberate policy choice. The visible sections allude to \"risk analysis,\" \"staffing challenges,\" \"risks of large numbers of people congregating\" (likely COVID-19 related), \"reputational risks,\" and \"cost implications.\"\n\nFrom a progressive standpoint, prioritizing operational convenience, perceived risk, or cost savings over the fundamental right to vote and equitable access to democratic participation is a significant deviation from core values. Governments, particularly those committed to social justice, should actively work to expand, not restrict, voter access. While health concerns during a pandemic are legitimate, the documents do not provide clear evidence that a robust, safe in-person voting option was unfeasible or that sufficient alternatives were adequately communicated and facilitated, especially given that Auckland successfully offered it. The implicit message is that the administrative burden or cost outweighed the imperative of ensuring maximum democratic participation for citizens overseas.\n\nIn summary, these documents highlight a governmental action that, while framed internally as a risk management and cost-efficiency measure, effectively curtailed civil liberties by restricting voter access and created social inequity in electoral participation for Australian citizens in New Zealand. This action deviates from progressive values that champion universal and equitable access to democratic processes as paramount.\n\nProvide only the markdown formatted summary text. Do not include any conversational filler or preamble."
