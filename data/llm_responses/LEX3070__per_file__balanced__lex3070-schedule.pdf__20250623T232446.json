Do not include any conversational filler or preamble.To aid you, the overview of the FOI request is: [REQUEST OVERVIEW START] The FOI request (LEX3070) sought applications made to the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) under s 141(2) of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 during early 2022, concerning reviews of party registration and deregistration decisions. The released documents, primarily communications and a detailed statistical analysis, reveal a strong theme of challenges to the AEC's administrative processes. Key content includes multiple parties (e.g., Democratic Labour Party, Flux, Health Australia Party) arguing that the AEC's party membership verification methodology is statistically flawed, unfair, and results in arbitrary deregistration outcomes, with Flux providing extensive analysis asserting the method is \"rigged.\" Additional challenges include the Australian Progressives alleging a clerical error in their deregistration, an objection to the registration of the David Pocock party based on candidate eligibility and name consistency, and an objection to the Australian Federation Party's logo for potential voter confusion.\n [REQUEST OVERVIEW END] \n\n--- MAIN DOCUMENT TEXT START ---\n\n\n\n--- Page 1 ---\n\nRequest for: \n\nLEX3070 FOI REQUEST \n\nall applications made to the Australian Electoral Commission under s 141 (2) of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 during the year 2022 prior to \n21st June 2022. \n\nSCHEDULE OF PUBLISHED DOCUMENTS \n\nPage 1 of 2\n\n\n--- Page 2 ---\n\n1 \n\n2 \n\n3 \n\n4 \n\n5 \n\n6 \n\n7 \n\n8 \n\n9 \n\nDocument \nNo. \n\nDescription \n\n  Email re Notice under s 134(6)(c) of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 \n\n(Electoral Act) - Australian Federation Party \n\n  Letter re Request for Review of Decision.  \n\n  Letter re Request for Review of Decision to Deregister Flux \n\n  Email re Request for review of the deregistration of VOTEFLUX.ORG \n\nWithheld pending exhaustion of third party review rights. \n\nDate \n\n11/03/2022 \n7:17 PM \n\n31/03/2022 \n\n14/04/2022 \n(date of receipt) \n\n26/04/2022 \n12:03 AM \n\n  Email re Please review your recent decision to deregister flux party. \n\n06/05/2022 \n\n  Email re Application under s 141(2) regarding Health Australia Party \n\n05/05/2022 \n\n  Email re Attention Mr Tom Rogers  \n\n  Email re request for internal review \n\n  Letter re internal review of the AECâ€™s decision to deregister the Australian \n\nProgressives \n\nEnd \n\n8/04/2022 \n10:50 AM \n\n11/04/2022 \n\n16/03/2022 \n(date or receipt) \n\nPage 2 of 2\n\n"
