            "text": "# Prematurely Opened Ballot Box Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)\n\nThis document details the mandatory procedures for Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) staff, including polling officials, Divisional Returning Officers (DROs), and Australian Electoral Officers (AEOs), when a ballot box containing ballot papers has been opened prematurely. The SOP outlines steps for investigating the incident, securing the ballot box and its contents, and meticulously examining the ballot papers and declaration vote envelopes to determine their eligibility for inclusion in or exclusion from the scrutiny process. The decision to exclude ballot papers or envelopes is based on whether they have been fraudulently altered or interfered with, impacting the voter's intention. The entire process, from reporting to final determination and handling of ballot papers, is oriented towards maintaining the integrity of the electoral result by validating the votes themselves.\n\n## Relevance to FOI Request LEX3041\n\nThis SOP supports the AEC's position regarding \"foreign objects\" (non-ballots) found in ballot boxes. While it provides detailed protocols for managing the integrity of *ballot papers* and *declaration vote envelopes* after a ballot box's integrity has been compromised by premature opening, it contains no provisions for identifying, listing, describing, or responding to the presence of *non-ballot foreign objects* within these boxes. Its exclusive focus on electoral material (ballots and declaration envelopes) confirms that AEC procedures prioritize the integrity of the vote count over the cataloging or retrieval of incidental non-ballot items."

Do not include any conversational filler or preamble.To aid you, the overview of the FOI request is: [REQUEST OVERVIEW START] FOI Request LEX3041 sought a list of \"foreign objects\" (non-ballots) found in ballot boxes and the Australian Electoral Commission's (AEC) response procedures. The AEC released the Election Procedures Handbook, Prematurely Opened Ballot Box Policy, and Prematurely Opened Ballot Box SOP. These documents reveal that the AEC's primary response to \"foreign objects\" (like personal items) is non-retrieval, as opening a box to retrieve such items would compromise electoral integrity, and no procedures or forms for listing or describing non-ballot foreign objects exist. While the \"Prematurely Opened\" documents detail handling for ballot boxes opened prematurely due to issues like seal discrepancies or damage, their focus is on managing the integrity and inclusion/exclusion of *ballots* and declaration vote envelopes, not on cataloging non-ballot items, consistently prioritizing the \"integrity of the result.\"\n [REQUEST OVERVIEW END] \n\n--- MAIN DOCUMENT TEXT START ---\n\n\n\n--- Page 1 ---\n\nSTANDARD OPERATING \nPROCEDURE \n\nPrematurely Opened \nBallot Box \n\nJULY 2020\n\n\n--- Page 2 ---\n\nContents \nRelevant information................................................................................................................................................ 2 \n\n1. \n\n2. \n\n3. \n\n4. \n\n5. \n\nOverview ....................................................................................................................................................... 3 \n\nRole of polling staff ........................................................................................................................................ 3 \n\nRole of Divisional Returning Officer .............................................................................................................. 4 \n\nRole of Australian Electoral Officer ............................................................................................................... 4 \n\nDealing with the ballot papers ....................................................................................................................... 5 \n\nRelevant information \n\n• \n\n• \n\n• \n\nPrematurely Opened Ballot Box Policy \n\nBallot Paper Handling Policy  \n\nBallot Paper Handling Scenario Guide \n\n2       SOP PREMATURELY OPENED BALLOT BOX\n\n\n--- Page 3 ---\n\n1.  Overview \n\n1.1  Section 238B of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 (the Electoral Act) and s 41AB of the Referendum \n(Machinery Provisions) Act 1984 (the Referendum Act) prescribe procedures that polling officials, \nDivisional Returning Officers (DROs) and Australian Electoral Officers (AEOs) must follow if a ballot box \ncontaining ballot papers has been opened prematurely \n\n1.2  The premature opening of a ballot box, or the discovery of a prematurely opened ballot box, triggers the \n\nrequirement to undertake: \n\n• \n\n• \n\nan investigation of the events leading up to the prematurely opening of the ballot box \n\nan examination of the ballot papers and declaration vote envelopes in the prematurely opened ballot \nbox to enable the AEO for the state or territory concerned to determine if they are to be included or \nexcluded from scrutiny. \n\n1.3  Further information, including what is and what isn’t considered a prematurely opened ballot box, is \n\nlocated in the Prematurely Opened Ballot Box Policy. \n\n2.  Role of polling staff  \n\n2.1  Polling staff who become aware that a ballot box containing ballot papers has been opened prematurely \n\nmust immediately report this to the Officer-in-Charge (OIC) or Team Leader. \n\n2.2  Once notified of the prematurely opened ballot box, according to the instructions in the Election \n\nProcedures Handbook, the OIC or Team Leader must: \n\n• \n\n• \n\n• \n\ntake the ballot box and any loose ballot papers to the ballot paper secure zone \n\nsecure the opened ballot box \n\ncount the ballot papers and/or declaration envelopes that were contained in the ballot box and place \nthese in a parcel \n\n• \n\nseal the parcel and affix with Label 33 – For AEO Investigation \n\n•  write on the label an indication of the type of ballot papers enclosed and that the ballot box has been \n\nprematurely opened \n\n• \n\nsign the label. \n\n2.3  The OIC/Team Leader must alert the Polling Place Liaison Officer (PPLO) / Early Voting Liaison Officer \n\n(EVLO) or DRO immediately about the incident. \n\n2.4  The OIC/Team Leader must ensure that the parcel containing ballot papers is sealed with tamper evident \n\ntape.  \n\n2.5  The OIC/Team Leader must prepare a report using the Prematurely opened ballot box report (EF285) \n\nfound in the return or materials catalogue, about the circumstances in which the ballot box was opened \nprematurely, including details of any witnesses. \n\n2.6  This report must be provided to the DRO along with the parcel, ballot box and any other thing the \n\nOIC/Team Leader considers appropriate as soon as practicable. A Ballot Paper Transfer Record (EF405) \nmust be completed. \n\n2.7  Transport of the ballot papers must comply with transport requirements as per the Ballot Paper Handling \n\nPolicy. \n\n3       SOP PREMATURELY OPENED BALLOT BOX\n\n\n--- Page 4 ---\n\n3.  Role of Divisional Returning Officer  \n\n3.1  The DRO for the division must examine the report, parcel, ballot box and any other thing provided by the \nOIC/Team Leader and provide all materials to the AEO for their state or territory. DROs must ensure that \nthey record the event and details of their observations and the report in the election diary. \n\n3.2  The DRO must ensure that an appropriate ballot paper secure zone is established to undertake this \nexamination. They must also ensure that when transporting ballot papers to the AEO, transport \nrequirements as per the Ballot Paper Handling Policy are complied with. The Ballot paper transfer record \n(EF405) must be completed at the time the transfer of custody of ballot paper takes place and retained on \nfile in the election diary. \n\n4.  Role of Australian Electoral Officer  \n\n4.1  The AEO must open the parcel and examine the ballot papers not enclosed in declaration envelopes, the \ndeclaration envelopes, the ballot box, the report and anything provided by the OIC via the DRO, and \ndecide whether ballot papers are to be included in the scrutiny and whether declaration envelopes are to \nbe included in preliminary scrutiny. \n\n4.2  The AEO must decide that a ballot paper is to be included into the scrutiny unless the AEO is satisfied \n\nthat the ballot paper has been fraudulently altered or otherwise interfered with so as not to reflect the \nvoter’s intention. \n\n4.3  The AEO must decide that an envelope is to be included in preliminary scrutiny unless the AEO is \n\nsatisfied that the envelope has been fraudulently altered. \n\n4.4  After examining all the ballot papers and envelopes, the AEO must place in separate parcels: \n\n• \n\n• \n\n• \n\n• \n\nall ballot papers that are to be included in the scrutiny \n\nall ballot papers that are to be excluded from the scrutiny \n\nall declaration envelopes that are to be included in preliminary scrutiny \n\nall declaration envelopes that are to be excluded from preliminary scrutiny. \n\n4.5  The AEO must then seal each parcel with tamper evident tape, and complete and affix Label 36 – AEO \n\nDecision. \n\n4.6  The AEO must then return the parcels containing ballot papers and declaration envelopes to the DRO for \nthe relevant division for inclusion or exclusion from either the scrutiny or preliminary scrutiny as the case \nrequires. The AEO must ensure that an EF405 is completed for each parcel at the time the transfer of \ncustody takes place. This form must be retained on file. \n\n4.7  Section 238B(14) of the Electoral Act requires that the AEO is responsible for the safe custody of the \n\nballot papers and declaration envelopes they have determined to be excluded from the scrutiny. The AEO \nmay decide to return these parcels to the DRO for storage pending statutorily authorised destruction; \nhowever they should be aware they ultimately remain responsible for these documents. \n\n4.8  Before the declaration of the poll in the election, the AEO must advise the Electoral Commissioner by \n\nformal minute, and the candidates concerned by letter, of the following: \n\n• \n\n• \n\n• \n\nthat a ballot box was opened before the close of poll other than in accordance with the Act \n\nthe number of ballot papers the AEO examined \n\nthe number of ballot papers that were excluded from the scrutiny because the AEO was satisfied that \nthey had been fraudulently altered or otherwise interfered with so as not to reflect the voter’s \nintention \n\n• \n\nthe number of declaration envelopes the AEO examined \n\n4       SOP PREMATURELY OPENED BALLOT BOX\n\n\n--- Page 5 ---\n\n• \n\nthe number of envelopes that were excluded from the preliminary scrutiny because the AEO was \nsatisfied that they had been fraudulently altered. \n\n4.9  The AEO is responsible for the safe custody of the report and any other thing given to the AEO by the \n\nDRO in relation to this matter until they are destroyed. \n\n5.  Dealing with the ballot papers \n\n5.1  Ballot papers to be included in the count are to then undergo the applicable scrutiny under the control of \nthe DRO. Ballot papers to be excluded from the scrutiny should be re-counted and these figures must be \nreconciled with the number provided in the OIC return. \n\n5.2  Ordinary ballot papers to be excluded from the count are to be recorded as ‘Discarded BPs’ in ELMS \n\nscreen RHVO. \n\n5.3  Declaration votes to be included in the count are then to either go through the declaration vote exchange \n\nprocess or through the preliminary scrutiny process, as the case may be. \n\n5.4  Declaration votes that have been rejected by the AEO should be processed through the RMANS \n\nDeclaration Scrutiny sub-system and rejected with the reason code DV (Discarded Declaration Votes). \nDROs should recheck these rejected declaration votes as per the usual process for rejected declaration \nvotes. \n\n5.5  Once scrutiny has been completed, all ballot papers that have been affected by this process are to be \nparcelled separately and stored with other ballot papers from the division in accordance with the Ballot \nPaper Handling Scenario Guide.  \n\n5       SOP PREMATURELY OPENED BALLOT BOX\n\n"
