Do not include any conversational filler or preamble.To aid you, the overview of the FOI request is: [REQUEST OVERVIEW START] FOI Request LEX3047 obtained Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) documents concerning complaints made primarily in April and May 2019 about electoral advertisements lacking authorisation or being misleading. The released materials include public email complaints and the AEC's responses to various entities like \"Our Vote Our Community\" and \"Bass Deserves Better\" Facebook pages, \"RiteOn!\" website, and other media. The complaints predominantly highlighted the absence of required authorisation details on political advertising across digital and print platforms, with some also raising concerns about misleading \"community group\" portrayals or unauthorised paid ads. In response, the AEC consistently clarified 'electoral matter' and authorisation requirements under the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918, requested subjects to add necessary authorisations, cease distribution of non-compliant materials, and advised on potential penalties up to $25,200 for non-compliance, as well as obligations for \"disclosure entities.\"\n [REQUEST OVERVIEW END] \n\n--- MAIN DOCUMENT TEXT START ---\n\n\n\n--- Page 1 ---\n\nFrom:\nSent:\nTo:\nCc:\nSubject:\n\nWednesday, 24 April 2019 6:23 PM\ninfo@votetonyout.com\nAuthorisation Section\nAuthorisation of certain merchandise containing electoral matter [DLM=For-\nOfficial-Use-Only]\n\nFollow Up Flag:\nFlag Status:\n\nFollow up\nFlagged\n\nDear \n\nThe Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) has received complaints regarding unauthorised electoral content and \nmerchandise being distributed by the “Vote Tony Out” website –  https://www.votetonyout.com/, and unauthorised \nadvertising on the “Vote Tony Out” Facebook page – https://www.facebook.com/votetonyout/. \n\nThe Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 (Electoral Act) is concerned, among other things, that voters know who is \ncommunicating electoral matter to them.  The AEC does not provide legal advice on how to comply with the \nElectoral Act, however, I offer the following observations in relation to the authorisation requirements in the \nAct.  The Electoral Backgrounder: Electoral communications and authorisation requirements on the AEC website \nprovides more information.  \n\nThe Electoral Act requires the communication of certain electoral matters to be authorised.  ‘Electoral matter’ is \ndefined in section 4AA(1) of the Electoral Act to be a matter communicated or intended to be communicated for the \ndominant purpose of influencing the way electors vote in a federal election. \n\nA communication containing electoral matter must be authorised if it is: \n\n  a paid electoral advertisement, or \n\n  a sticker, fridge magnet, leaflet, flyer, pamphlet, notice, poster or how-to-vote card, or \n\n  a matter communicated by or on behalf of a disclosure entity (e.g. a candidate, Senator or Member of the \nHouse of Representatives, registered political party, an associated entity or other person or group who is \nrequired to submit a return under Part XX of the Electoral Act). \n\nIt is an offence under section 321D(5) of the Electoral Act to make these types of electoral communications without \nproper authorisation.   \n\nThe AEC has checked the Vote Tony Out campaign sites and identified the following issues. \n\nAuthorisation of Vote Tony Out stickers \n\nThe stickers for sale on the Vote Tony Out website contain electoral matter that requires authorisation under \nsection 321D(1)(b) of the Electoral Act.  Can you please stop selling and distributing the unauthorised stickers.  The \nother merchandise for sale on the website does not need to be authorised. \n\nAuthorisation of Vote Tony Out Facebook page \n\nThe Vote Tony Out Facebook page is currently running paid advertising promoting the Vote Tony Out rally on \n5 May.  This electoral advertising needs to be authorised or have a link to an authorised Facebook page.  The \nauthorisation of a social media site only needs the name and city of the person authorising the site.  The \nauthorisation can be added to the “About” section in a Facebook page. \n\nAuthorisation of Vote Tony Out website \n\n1\n\n47F47F\n\n\n--- Page 2 ---\n\nI note you have an authorisation on the Mail chimp webpage supporting the Vote Tony Out website.  To be prudent \nI recommend adding this authorisation to the bottom of the Vote Tony Out website (alongside the copyright notice) \nand/or on the website “About” page. \n\nWhether Vote Tony Out is or will become a third party (disclosure entity) for the purpose of the Electoral Act \n\nAs noted above a disclosure entity must authorise all electoral communications.  A ‘disclosure entity’ is defined in \nsection 321B of the Electoral Act to include a person or entity who will incur electoral expenditure during a financial \nyear above the disclosure threshold (currently $13,800). \n\nIf you think you will spend more than $13,8000 this financial year on electoral communications then you will need to \nprovide a disclosure return to the AEC under Part XX of the Electoral Act and also must authorise all your electoral \ncommunications.  There are also other obligations on third parties in the Electoral Act, such as restrictions on \nreceiving foreign donations.  \n\nActions \n\nCan you please: \n\n  Stop the sale and distribution of unauthorised Vote Tony Out stickers from the Vote Tony Out website.  If \n\nyou want to sell more stickers, the stickers will need to have an authorisation added. \n\n  Authorise any paid electoral advertising on social media or elsewhere \n\n  Authorise the Vote Tony Out Facebook page and website (and if the Vote Tony Out Twitter site and \n\nInstagram page are also running paid electoral advertising or you think you will become a disclosure entity \nfor the purpose of the Electoral Act, these sites should also include an authorisation)  \n\nCan you please take this action by COB Monday 29 April and advise the AEC of this action. \n\nYours sincerely \n\n | Principal Government Lawyer \n\nElectoral Authorisation Section | Legal & Procurement Branch \nAustralian Electoral Commission \nT: \n\n2\n\n47FSection 47F\n\n"
