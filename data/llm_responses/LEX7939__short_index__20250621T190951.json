The AEC's self-contained response provided historical designated elector numbers from its website, but no future-dated figures. It revealed that 37 declarations were made in FY 2022/23, 1 in FY 2023/24, and 211 so far in FY 2024/25, all made by a delegate of the Electoral Commissioner. Internal reviews for declarations totalled four in FY 2022/23 and four in FY 2024/25 (with outcomes largely confirming decisions, except for one set aside in FY 2024/25), while no applications for external review were made to the Administrative Review Tribunal, and no declarations ceased effect under s 202AH(3) across the requested financial years."
