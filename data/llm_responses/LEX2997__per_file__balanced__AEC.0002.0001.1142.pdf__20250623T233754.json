The email confirms that the AEC's response to *The Guardian* acknowledges an active investigation into Andrew Laming MP's Facebook pages for authorisation compliance, along with minor details about the law's application. It anticipates a forthcoming *Guardian* article focusing on the AEC's investigation. The email also notes significant public discussion on Twitter, where sentiment is generally skeptical of the AEC's ability, impartiality, or power to take action, and indicates the AEC plans to monitor and respond to this social media activity.\n\n### Relevance to FOI Request\nThis document is directly relevant to the FOI request as it confirms the AEC's public acknowledgement of an active investigation into Andrew Laming MP's Facebook pages, a key subject of the FOI request. It specifically details communication with *The Guardian*, a media outlet highlighted in the request overview as having reported on the issue. The email provides insight into the AEC's internal handling of media inquiries and public relations concerning the investigation, including awareness of public skepticism regarding its enforcement capabilities, thereby corroborating and enriching the context of the FOI request."

  "prompt": "Considering this document as part of an FOI request, summarize the document and its relevance to the FOI request in markdown format. Provide only the markdown formatted summary text. Do not include any conversational filler or preamble.To aid you, the overview of the FOI request is: [REQUEST OVERVIEW START] The FOI request disclosed documents detailing the Australian Electoral Commission's (AEC) investigation into Andrew Laming MP's Facebook pages for compliance with federal electoral authorisation laws. This inquiry was triggered by public complaints and media reports, notably from *The Guardian*, alleging Laming used numerous pages (e.g., \"Redland Bay Bulletin,\" \"Redlands Institute\") disguised as community or news groups to promote political content and attack opponents without mandatory disclosures. The AEC confirmed an active investigation, noting 2018 Electoral Act amendments broadened social media authorisation, and issued formal notices to Laming for detailed information and to third parties (like Facebook) for data, with Facebook confirming its cooperation. Findings revealed some pages were removed or updated with authorisation, while others remained active and unauthorised.\n [REQUEST OVERVIEW END] \n\n--- MAIN DOCUMENT TEXT START ---\n\n\n\n--- Page 1 ---\n\nAEC.0002.0001.1142\n\nFrom:                                 mediaSent:                                  Wed, 7 Apr 2021 11:25:25 +1000To:                                      Executive Leadership TeamCc:                                      David Lang;Bernadette O'Meara;media;Louise Parrott;Justin Sowden;Alex Morris;Mark Batistich;Isabella McCormickSubject:                             FYI: Guardian response re Laming FB authorisation [SEC=OFFICIAL]Hi all The below response has now been sent to The Guardian. The response simply confirms our investigation of the matter and otherwise provides minor extraneous details re application of the law. Receipt has been acknowledged & we can expect a follow-up article very soon with AEC investigation as a lead.  Twitter activityThere is a reasonable level of Twitter activity on the matter off the back of tweets like the ones below. The general response in relation to the AEC – from members of the public - is a mixture of “don’t expect AEC to do anything”, “the AEC is biased so won’t take action” and “they don’t have any power to take action”.  As is standard on the channel – purple signs have been raised a number of times.  We will monitor Twitter traffic and provide some select responses – based on the below enquiry response.
