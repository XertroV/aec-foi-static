It requests information to assist the AEC's investigation, with a submission deadline of June 16, 2021, and asks for acknowledgment of receipt by June 4, 2021.\n\nThis document is highly relevant to the FOI request as it provides direct evidence of the Australian Electoral Commission actively conducting its investigation into Andrew Laming MP's Facebook pages for compliance with electoral authorisation laws. The issuance of a formal notice under Section 321F confirms the AEC's use of its legal powers to compel detailed information from relevant parties, aligning with the FOI request's overview that the AEC \"issued formal notices to Laming for detailed information and to third parties (like Facebook) for data.\" This demonstrates a concrete step in the AEC's information-gathering process for the stated inquiry."

Do not include any conversational filler or preamble.To aid you, the overview of the FOI request is: [REQUEST OVERVIEW START] The FOI request disclosed documents detailing the Australian Electoral Commission's (AEC) investigation into Andrew Laming MP's Facebook pages for compliance with federal electoral authorisation laws. This inquiry was triggered by public complaints and media reports, notably from *The Guardian*, alleging Laming used numerous pages (e.g., \"Redland Bay Bulletin,\" \"Redlands Institute\") disguised as community or news groups to promote political content and attack opponents without mandatory disclosures. The AEC confirmed an active investigation, noting 2018 Electoral Act amendments broadened social media authorisation, and issued formal notices to Laming for detailed information and to third parties (like Facebook) for data, with Facebook confirming its cooperation. Findings revealed some pages were removed or updated with authorisation, while others remained active and unauthorised.\n [REQUEST OVERVIEW END] \n\n--- MAIN DOCUMENT TEXT START ---\n\n\n\n--- Page 1 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 2 ---\n\nAEC.0002.0001.7344\n\nPlease find attached a written notice in accordance with section 321F of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 for information to assist the AECâ€™s investigation.
