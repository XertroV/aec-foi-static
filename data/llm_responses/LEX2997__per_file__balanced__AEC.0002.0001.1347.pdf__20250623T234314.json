The inquiry, prompted by public complaints and media reports (notably *The Guardian*), focused on allegations that Laming used various pages (e.g., \"Redland Bay Bulletin,\" \"Redlands Institute\") disguised as community or news groups to disseminate political content and attack opponents without mandatory electoral authorisations. The AEC confirmed an active investigation, citing the broadened scope of social media authorisation under 2018 Electoral Act amendments. It issued formal information requests to Laming and data requests to third parties like Facebook, which cooperated. The investigation revealed that while some pages were subsequently removed or updated with proper authorisation, others remained active and unauthorised.\n\n### Relevance to FOI Request\nThis document *is* the core content of the FOI request, providing a comprehensive overview of the AEC's investigation into Andrew Laming MP's alleged breaches of federal electoral authorisation laws via his Facebook pages. It outlines the complaints that initiated the probe, the specific nature of the allegations (disguised pages, lack of disclosure), the legal framework referenced (2018 Electoral Act amendments), the investigative steps taken by the AEC (issuing notices to Laming and Facebook), and the interim findings regarding the authorisation status of the pages. As such, it directly addresses the request for information detailing the AEC's inquiry into Laming's social media activities."
