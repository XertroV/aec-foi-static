Do not include any conversational filler or preamble.To aid you, the overview of the FOI request is: [REQUEST OVERVIEW START] The FOI request disclosed documents detailing the Australian Electoral Commission's (AEC) investigation into Andrew Laming MP's Facebook pages for compliance with federal electoral authorisation laws. This inquiry was triggered by public complaints and media reports, notably from *The Guardian*, alleging Laming used numerous pages (e.g., \"Redland Bay Bulletin,\" \"Redlands Institute\") disguised as community or news groups to promote political content and attack opponents without mandatory disclosures. The AEC confirmed an active investigation, noting 2018 Electoral Act amendments broadened social media authorisation, and issued formal notices to Laming for detailed information and to third parties (like Facebook) for data, with Facebook confirming its cooperation. Findings revealed some pages were removed or updated with authorisation, while others remained active and unauthorised.\n [REQUEST OVERVIEW END] \n\n--- MAIN DOCUMENT TEXT START ---\n\n\n\n--- Page 1 ---\n\nAEC.0002.0001.1594\n\nFrom:                                 The AustralianSent:                                  Mon, 12 Apr 2021 06:14:52 +1000To:                                      Jeff PopeSubject:                             AM Edition + your daily COVID-19 briefingCAUTION: This email originated from outside of the Australian Federal Government.

Firms urge Covid minimum wage delayLow-paid workers in COVID-stressed industries could be hit by a second year of delayed minimum wage increases as the Fair Work Commission examines whether to again stagger pay rises for 2.2 million workers across the next financial year.Citing the winding up of the JobKeeper scheme and doubts over the vaccination rollout, employers in hard-hit sectors are urging the commission to either impose a 12-month minimum wage freeze or delay pay increases in industries adversely impacted by the COVID-19 economic shock by up to seven months.READ MORE: Pricing workers out of jobs would hold back recovery |  PM shelves vaccination targets | Recovery on track despite rollout delay  | Union calls for minimum wage for fruit pickers |  How Fair Work justifies $13 wage rise |  Wage rise ‘an assault on small business’Now that the vaccine rollout has been disrupted potentially, the most affected industries will continue to be the most affected and should not be forced to incur two wage increases within five months.WES LAMBERT, RESTAURANT AND CATERING2. Coronavirus briefing: PM shelves jab targets; Recovery on track despite rollout delay; ‘Please explain’ on hotel quarantine\n\n\n--- Page 3 ---\n\nAEC.0002.0001.1596\n\nPrime Minister Scott Morrison says it is not possible to know whether every Australian will receive a vaccine shot before the end of the year, saying the federal government has no plans to set new targets. Keep up with the latest in our live blog.A further delay to the national vaccine rollout means most Australians will not enjoy a return to pre-COVID normality until early next year, but economists are confident the latest news around the AstraZeneca jab will not be enough to meaningfully “shift the dial” on the pace of the recovery.Another coronavirus case has been added to Queensland’s COVID-19 tally after it was revealed a woman who attended a party in Byron Bay last month tested positive. Health authorities have been quick to assure the community the newly identified case poses no risk to the public, as the patient had been in self isolation.And Victoria’s opposition has called for the state’s Auditor-General to investigate why contracts to operate the state’s hotel quarantine scheme were given to security operators, including one that was linked to a $4.5m collapse.\n\n\n--- Page 4 ---\n\nAEC.0002.0001.1597\n\nPrivate security contractors were directly responsible for triggering Victoria’s catastrophic second wave, resulting in the deaths of more than 800 Victorians, 250,000 job losses and immeasurable social and economic harms.DAVID SOUTHWICK, OPPOSITION POLICE SPOKESMAN3. The outsiders: How Prince Philip and Diana were alike\n\n\n--- Page 5 ---\n\nAEC.0002.0001.1598\n\nViewed through the prism of the woke, gender-fluid, cancelled culture of the 2020s, Prince Philip seems an anachronism: epitomising the rigidity of the British establishment of which he was at the heart, writes Anne Barrowclough. In fact it was Philip who dragged the monarchy out of the 19th century, who encouraged Britons to see themselves as innovators, who despised the stuffy elitism of the world he entered on his marriage to the young Princess Elizabeth.Even before the royal wedding in 1947 and in the early years of Elizabeth’s monarchy, the young naval officer was seen as the Princess Diana of his times; a modernising force, the man who would, some hoped and others dreaded, drive a musty establishment into the 20th century.IN OTHER NEWS:Too many Indigenous kids jailed: police chiefWar hero ‘buried proof of lewd conduct’Accused lawyer ‘invited to leave’Laming defies PM by seeking preselectionStrewth!: Turnbull tucks in for a busy week aheadWORLD: Charles delivers tribute to his ‘dear papa’Philip tired of ‘royalty nonsense’ at schoolVolcanic ash covers island then floats off to BarbadosBiden moves on Supreme ‘stack’4.

In Commentary todayFederalism grounds our entire system of government, and COVID has transformed it, possibly permanently, changing the game like Kerry Packer changed cricket, leaving the states in charge, writes Greg Craven.Anonymity has given trolls free rein to defame without incurring financial penalty or reputational risk. But the victims of slander on social media are fighting back, led by Peter Dutton, writes Jennifer Oriel.Dutton tolerated his abusers for many years, but after Greens senator Larissa Waters dubbed him an ‘inhuman, sexist rape apologist’ on Twitter, he appeared to reach his limit. JENNIFER ORIEL\n\n\n--- Page 7 ---\n\nAEC.0002.0001.1600\n\nThe Editorial: The principle that all employees are entitled to at least a minimum wage — the lowest amount they can be paid for their work — is an accepted part of workplace relations in Australia. Those workers, traditionally, all receive a pay rise at the same time. A second year of delaying pay rises for workers in sectors experiencing economic hardship could set a precedent, one that unions would oppose vehemently. But it would bring some flexibility to workplace relations and link wage rises to employers’ ability to pay, which would help struggling small businesses.Delve into Letters to the Editor here.6.
