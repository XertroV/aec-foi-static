Each email acknowledges a referral from the AEC and confirms the removal of content or an account for violating TikTok's community guidelines. The issues addressed include AEC staff being recorded without consent, an AEC impersonation account, electoral misinformation, and other unspecified content referrals.\n\nThis document is highly relevant to the FOI request (LEX3037) as it provides concrete examples of the \"direct communication channels and content referrals\" between the AEC and major tech companies, specifically TikTok, during the 2022 federal election period. It demonstrates the AEC's \"proactive engagement\" through its Electoral Integrity Assurance Taskforce in \"identifying, monitoring, and addressing electoral misinformation, disinformation, and non-compliant content\" on the platform, thereby illustrating the collaborative efforts to safeguard election integrity described in the request overview."
