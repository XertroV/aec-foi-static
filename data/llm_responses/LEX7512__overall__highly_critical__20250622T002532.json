            "text": "The provided FOI documents expose a shocking display of Australian governmental incompetence, potential corruption, and a brazen disregard for historical truth and the self-determination of the Norfolk Island people. The narrative reveals a colonial power imposing its will through bureaucratic obstinacy, while deliberately ignoring its own historical documents and legal inconsistencies.\n\nThe Norfolk Island Chamber of Commerce (NICC) and individual islanders have mounted a meticulously researched challenge to Australia's perceived sovereignty, asserting that Norfolk Island retains its status as a \"distinct and separate Settlement\" under the British Imperial Crown, never legally annexed or ceded to Australia. Their evidence, drawn from *Australian government documentation files* (including Hansard records, Governor-General's FOI responses, and a 1971 confidential cabinet report), explicitly states:\n\n*   Norfolk Island was \"never\" under the Government of NSW.\n*   The 1913 Norfolk Island Act, which purportedly accepted the island into the Commonwealth, is \"invalid in law\" because the necessary Imperial legislation and constitutional process (Norfolk Island being \"PLACED\" by the Queen *before* Australia \"ACCEPTED\") never occurred.\n*   The Governor-General's office, in response to an FOI, \"has been unable to identify any documents\" proving transfer of land interest or an \"original claim of right\" over Norfolk Island by the Commonwealth. This is a damning admission of a foundational absence of legal title.\n*   A 1971 confidential cabinet report explicitly states: \"The Island is not legally part of the Commonwealth and hence is not part of 'Australia'.\"\n*   The Royal Australian Mint in 1999 stated: \"Norfolk Island itself was not incorporated into the Commonwealth and has never been ceded or annexed to Australia.\"\n\nThese are not the claims of a fringe group but direct quotes from the Australian government's own historical records, revealing a profound and possibly deliberate historical misrepresentation.\n\nThe Australian Electoral Commission (AEC), the primary government entity responding, demonstrates a shocking level of bureaucratic dismissiveness and legal sophistry:\n\n*   **Refusal to Engage:** The AEC repeatedly states it \"does not intend to engage further on the constitutional issues you have raised\" and refers the matter to other departments. This is a blatant dereliction of duty, as the core issue directly impacts the legitimacy of their electoral operations on the island. It signals a governmental inability or unwillingness to confront inconvenient truths.\n*   **Circular Logic:** The AEC's justification for forcing Norfolk Islanders to vote is that \"the Electoral Act... extend[s] the operation these Acts to Norfolk Island.\" This is a circular argument; the islanders are challenging the *legality* of that extension, yet the AEC treats it as settled law without providing foundational proof.\n*   **Misrepresentation of High Court Judgments:** The AEC cherry-picks and misrepresents High Court rulings, notably *Bennett v Commonwealth (2007)*. While the AEC cites the court's general ruling that Commonwealth laws *can* apply to Norfolk Island, they conveniently ignore Justice Callinan's explicit and damning statement: \"Norfolk Island did not on its acceptance by Australia, nor has it since, become part of Australia, geographically or politically. Statements to the contrary in Berwick Ltd v Gray [198] are wrong. Its community is not and has never been part of the Australian community.\" This omission is either gross legal incompetence or a deliberate attempt to perpetuate a false narrative.\n*   **Passing the Buck:** The AEC deflects responsibility by directing inquiries to the Department of Infrastructure, Attorney-General's Department, and Department of Home Affairs, indicating a fragmented government apparatus unable or unwilling to take collective responsibility for its actions. This suggests a lack of a unified, legally sound position on Norfolk Island's status.\n*   **Coercion and Threats:** The implication that failure to enrol or vote \"may lead to an administrative penalty or prosecution in court\" reveals a coercive approach, forcing a population, whom they cannot legally prove are citizens or under their jurisdiction, into compliance under threat of punishment.\n\nThe redactions (S22, S42, S47F) on several documents, particularly those involving legal advice (S42), further fuel suspicion that the government is actively concealing internal disagreements, legal vulnerabilities, or admissions that would undermine its tenuous claim over Norfolk Island.\n\nIn essence, these documents paint a damning picture of an Australian government operating with a colonial-era mentality, relying on historical falsehoods and bureaucratic stonewalling to maintain control over a population that asserts its distinct sovereign identity. The government's actions demonstrate a systemic failure to uphold principles of transparency, historical accuracy, and potentially, international law, opting instead for coercive imposition and the ruthless suppression of truth."

He \nrequested that the Council of Elders support the Mayor in working with the Administrator \nto develop a proposed preamble for broad consultation.  The Administrator has advised \nthat the Mayor has held discussions with the Council of Elders.   \n\n \n\nYou may wish to:  \n\no \n\no \n\nseek an update on the Mayor’s meeting with the Council of Elders; and \n\nadvise that the Australian Government is committed to protecting Norfolk Island’s \nculture and heritage, for example: \n\n \n\n \n\nBackground \n\nNorf’k is an official language of Norfolk Island and the curriculum at Norfolk \nIsland Central School includes classes in the Norf’k language and culture; and \n\nNorfolk Island’s public holidays have been maintained. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nThe NI Act previously contained a preamble that included a statement about the special \nrelationship of Pitcairn Island descendants with Norfolk Island and their desire to preserve \ntheir traditions and culture. \n\nThe Advisory Council established to represent the Norfolk Island community before the \ncommencement of NIRC consulted the Norfolk Island community on a proposed new \npreamble. However, community feedback was divided. \n\nIn February 2016, the Advisory Council recommended to the Hon Paul Fletcher MP, the \nthen Minister for Territories, Local Government and Major Projects, that the matter of a \npreamble should be further considered by NIRC. \n\n2.03 Key Issues Brief – Preamble to the Norfolk Island Act 1979 \n\nPage 1 of 2\n\n\n--- Page 3 ---\n\nDEPARTMENT OF

This work was expected to be completed by the end of August 2018 but the \nDepartment has not had any information to indicate this has occurred.  \n\nBackground: \n\nNIPD \n\n \n\n \n\nNIPD was established in June 2015 with the aim of having Norfolk Island inscribed on the \nUN’s list of non-self-governing territories.  \n\nIt is difficult to gauge the true level of support for NIPD on Norfolk Island. The group \nclaim to have over 1,000 supporters (likely to include visitors to the Island) and to be \nrepresenting the majority of views. NIPD’s fundraising methods and affiliations, however, \nhave been the subject of some concern and scrutiny in public forums.  \n\nProcess for Inscription \n\n \n\n \n\nThe UN General Assembly must approve any addition of a territory to the list of non-self-\ngoverning territories. This can follow a recommendation made by the Special Committee \non Decolonisation (also known as the Committee of 24, or C24) which monitors and \nreviews the list of non-self-governing territories. \n\nAlternatively, a draft resolution may be proposed before the UN General Assembly by a \nMember State. NIPD would need to obtain the sponsorship of a Member State to the UN to \nput forward the draft resolution to the UN General Assembly plenary.  \n\n2.04 Petition to the United Nations (UN) \n\nPage 1 of 2\n\n\n--- Page 11 ---\n\nDEPARTMENT OF INFRASTRUCTURE, REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT AND CITIES \n\n \n\nPassage of the resolution would rely on the support of a simple majority of UN Member \nStates present and voting. This would likely require extensive lobbying by NIPD and the \nsponsoring Member State. The Department of Infrastructure, Regional Development and \nCities (the Department) is aware of lobbying by NIPD in New Zealand and the UK. \n\nSensitivities: If none just note ‘Nil’ \n\n  Since June 2016, NIPD has been staging a sit-in protest at the Old Military Barracks. The \n\nprotest presents a risk to the heritage values of the site.  \n\n  The Department is also aware of an alleged complaint lodged by Mr Albert Buffett, President \n\nof the Council of Elders, to the UN’s Human Rights Committee claiming the Australian \nGovernment has breached its international human rights obligations.  \n\n  The Australian Government has received no official notification about this complaint from the \nUN.

The Australian Government also has no “control” \nover the indigenous Norfolk Islanders, especially those who are descendants of the \nPitcairn Settlers living on Norfolk Island. \n\nFor some evidence of what is stated above we refer you all to the attachments. \n\nThe Chamber Committee also recommends you read freedom of information \nstatements from the Governor-General’s office, Attorney-General’s office, Australia \nPost, Fair Works Commission and many from the Department of Infrastructure, \nTransport, Regional Development, Communication and the Arts as well as other \ndepartments of the Australian Government, where you will see that the \nCommonwealth of Australia has no authority, even in an administrative role over \nNorfolk Island and Norfolk Islanders since 1901. \n\nIf the Australian Government insists on including indigenous Norfolk Islanders (those \nliving on Norfolk Island) in the Australian Government elections, then the Australian \n\nNorfolk Island Chamber of Commerce,   Norfolk Island                     Email:   norfolkisland.coc@gmail.com\n\n\n--- Page 47 ---\n\nGovernment is in breach of its own Commonwealth of Australia Constitution and \nbreaking its own laws and acting unlawfully and illegally in international law. \n\nThe Chamber Committee brings to your attention the following which was placed in \npublic domain in December 2024. \n\nOpen letter to media editors \nAt Last: A brief explanation of the Truth - Norfolk Island \nJust on 3 years we commenced the journey with the aim of finding out the \ntruth of what Norfolk Island’s true legal and lawful status is since our ancestors \narrived on Norfolk Island 8 June 1856. Along the way we have had some help \nfrom a few people, and we thank you all for that. We have ignored the \nnegative comments, the threats and pushed through to eventually put \ntogether what we have found - the TRUTH. \n\nHer Majesty Queen Victoria’s Imperial Wastelands Act 1855 \n\n· This Act was for the purpose of settling ‘unsettled’ Imperial Crown land \n\n· It was under this Act that allowed Queen Victoria’s Agreement through the \n1856 Order in Council to separate Norfolk Island into a distinct and separate \nColony within the British Empire for the Pitcairn Settlers and their \ndescendants. \n\nIn May 1856 Queen Victoria commenced arrangements for a Royal Seal and \nthe Order 24 June 1856, was also for “Trade and Foreign Affairs” to be “made \nuse of within the said Government”. Then December 1856 the Royal Warrant \nwas signed by Queen Victoria. All those were used to ‘settle’ the Crown waste \nland of Norfolk Island in 1856. The Governor of New South Wales as Governor \nof Norfolk Island “for the time being” disappears completely. \n\nThe relocation of the Pitcairn Islanders to Norfolk Island was a result of a direct \nAgreement between Queen Victoria and the people of Pitcairn’s Island. This \nAgreement carried legal, lawful and moral significance, recognising the Pitcairn \nIslander’s autonomy, rights and self-governance under the protection of the \nImperial Crown.\n\n\n--- Page 48 ---\n\nThere is so much more to this Truth and in the new year it will be explained \nand how it links in a positive way for the United Nations complaint and what \naction needs to commence immediately. · \n\nAlbert always used to say “start from 1855” -- thanks Al. \n\nNo-one can change the Truth - and that Truth now must be adhered to for the \nmemory of our ancestors, for the sake of the descendants of the Pitcairn \nSettlers and the future generation and Norfolk Islanders. \n\nThere is more on this to come in 2025. \n\nIn the meantime, we are more than happy to talk to anyone who is willing to \nlisten and understand and accept the Truth. \n\nNorfolk Island’s legal status must be reviewed and restored to reflect the \nprotections established under the Imperial 1855 Act. The breaches committed \n- both legal and moral- demand accountability and reaffirmation of the Norfolk \nIslanders rights. \n\nThe people of Norfolk Island (Pitcairn Settlers) were promised self-governance \nand autonomy under the Imperial Crown’s protection. It is time for that \npromise to be honoured. \n\nMay 2025 be the year of lawful restoration - and may God be with all Ucklun. \nCatherine McCoy and Cherri Buffett, \nDescendants of the Pitcairn Settlers. · 28th December 2024 \n\nThe Chamber Committee awaits a reply from the Australian Electoral Commission \nbefore 31st January 2025. \n\nSincerely, \nNorfolk Island Chamber of Commerce Committee \nNorfolk Island Chamber of Commerce \n_Disclaimer_ \nThis message and the information therein is for the recipient only and may contain confidential and/or legally privileged \nmaterial. Any review, disclosure, dissemination, re-transmission, copying or other use of, or taking any action in reliance upon this \ninformation is prohibited without Chamber Committee approval in writing.  \nIf you have received this email in error, please notify Chamber and delete all communication of this transmission including any \nattachments\n\n\n--- Page 49 ---\n\nNorfolk Island Chamber of Commerce  \n\nOpen Submmission: \n\nSubmission  \nto the  \nNorfolk Island Governance Committee \n\n“Proposed Preamble” \n\nA preamble (introductory statement) to any document should be legally correct and show \n\nthe truth of the history it is referring to. \n\nThe Norfolk Island Chamber of Commerce (Chamber) Committee believes an answer must \n\nbe given to an initial question of:- \n\nIs this proposed preamble to be included with a statute? \n\nIf so, which statute? \n\nAnd, the Chamber is of the opinion that the proposed preamble then has a legal status \n\nmeaning and it is vitally important to ensure the truth is told within that proposed preamble.   \n\nCan and will the Norfolk Island Governance Committee and the \n\nCommonwealth of Australia confirm in writing that all the information \n\nwithin the proposed preamble are true and correct records of history? \n\nIf not, then until all that information is confirmed and evidence is provided to Norfolk \n\nIslanders and, especially to the descendants of the Pitcairn Settlers (many who are \n\nChamber members) then that proposed preamble, or any preamble should not and cannot \n\nbe used. \n\nCan the Australian Government state categorically that they are \n\ncommitted to a new preamble that has only the evidence of truth of \n\nNorfolk Island, and Norfolk Islander’s history since 1850s?    \n\nPage 1 of 6\n\n\n--- Page 50 ---\n\nQuestions have already been asked for the true facts of Norfolk Island’s history from the  \n\n1850s  to be provided to the Norfolk Island people by the Australian Government, but \n\nneither the Australian Government nor the Norfolk Island Governance Committee have had \n\nthe courtesy to do so.  That is unacceptable and leads to Norfolk Islanders and other \n\npeople believing that the Australian Government is possibly hiding something – perhaps the \n\ntruth.    \n\nIt is also a person’s human rights to have and live by and with the truth: \n\nThe United Nations states: \n\nHuman rights are rights inherent to all human beings, regardless of race, sex, nationality, \n\nethnicity, language, religion, or any other status. Human rights include the right to life and \n\nliberty, freedom from slavery and torture, freedom of opinion and expression, the right to \n\nwork and education, and many more.  Everyone is entitled to these rights, without \n\ndiscrimination. \n\nhttps://www.un.org/en/global-issues/human-\n\nrights#:~:text=Human%20rights%20are%20rights%20inherent,and%20education%2\n\nC%20and%20many%20more. \n\nApart from adhering to the Australian Constitution, it is the Australian Government’s moral \n\nduty to provide the legitimacy of history, especially after what was stated in the \n\ndocumentations for the then Minister responsible for Norfolk Island, Senator Ley and in \n\nwhich her brief refers to the then Preamble and the history of the descendants of the \n\nPitcairn Settlers  \n\n(Refer:  attachments   No. 1, 1A, 1B). \n\nAustralia is a constitutional monarchy.   \n\nFor the Commonwealth of Australia (Australian Government) to ignore, and/or change the \n\nhistory of Norfolk Island is unlawful and just as important, it is disrespectful and an insult to \n\nthe memory of Her Majesty Queen Victoria, to the Monarchy itself, to the descendants of \n\nthe Pitcairn Settlers and to Norfolk Islanders.   \n\nThe following reference to evidence should also be included in this proposed preamble.   \n\n(Refer attachment No. 2).   \n\nPage 2 of 6\n\n\n--- Page 51 ---\n\nThese copied extracts are from public documents obtained through research. \n\ni. \n\n19th May 1856 - Establishment of the Norfolk Island Seal to be used by the Norfolk \n\nIsland Government.   \n\nii. \n\n8th June 1856 – the Pitcairn Settlers arrived and took possession (ownership) of \n\nNorfolk Island, and from that day governed themselves with their own Constitution, \n\nlaws and government. \n\niii. \n\n24th June 1856 – An order of Her Majesty Queen Victoria   (refer to typed copy \n\nattachment No. 2) \n\niv. \n\n24th June 1856 - Her Majesty Queen Victoria’s Instructions.  The handwritten \n\ndocument has a Royal Seal stamp at the top left. \n\nv. \n\n5th December 1856 - Her Majesty Queen Victoria’s Royal Warrant for Norfolk Island.    \n\n(Refer:  attachment No. 3) \n\nThe Chamber provides the following information for consideration by the Norfolk Island \n\nGovernance Committee and which must assist with bringing about ensuring the truth is \n\nplaced in the proposed preamble:-: \n\na)  A typed document entitled Order In Council, dated 24th June 1856  \n\n(Refer:  attachment No. 4) \n\n• This document does not have Her Majesty Queen Victoria’s Seal. \n\n• A handwritten document is in #9, Quality Row, Norfolk Island but again \n\nthere is no Royal Seal on the document, it also says “copy”.  What is \n\nit a Copy of? \n\n• Where is the handwritten document (as referred to here), and written \n\nlike the Instructions mentioned above (point  no. iv) of the Order in \n\nCouncil dated 24th June 1856 with Her Majesty Queen Victoria’s \n\napproval and Royal Seal? \n\nb)  In printed papers “Further Papers, Removal of Inhabitants of Pitcairn’s Island to \n\nNorfolk Island” there is the same typed information as referred to in a) above.    \n\nc)  That document in b) above is linked to a despatch from Hon. H. Labouchere, MP \n\n(London) to Governor Sir W. Denison (NSW) dated 27th June 1856.  Also included in \n\nthat same despatch is the wording:-  \n\nPage 3 of 6\n\n\n--- Page 52 ---\n\n“transmit to you Her Majesty’s Instructions, under the Royal Sign Manual \n\nand Signet, for the guidance of your conduct in administering the affairs of \n\nNorfolk Island”.   \n\nThose ‘Instructions’ are not included in the printed copies mentioned \n\nin b) above.  Why not? \n\nThe Chamber states that until all the correct and truthful information regarding Her \n\nMajesty Queen Victoria’s decisions and instructions are provided to the public (which \n\nincludes Chamber members) then no further action can be taken about a proposed \n\npreamble.   \n\nThe reasons are because the 24th June 1856 Order in Council is referred to in:- \n\n➢  The Order in Council 15th January 1897 \n\n➢  The Order in Council 30th March 1914 \n\n➢  The Norfolk Island Act No. 15 of 1913 – Commonwealth of Australia, and therefore in \n\nall other acts following on from the 1913 Act.                            \n\n➢  The Norfolk Island Act 1979  \n\nTurning now to the Commonwealth of Australia (Australian Government) Norfolk Island Act \n\nNo. 15 of 1913 which is mentioned in the proposed preamble, the Chamber makes the \n\nfollowing comments: \n\n▪  Firstly, in letters dated 1913 from the British Government (Downing Street) to \n\nAustralian Government it states that Imperial Legislation is necessary  “before \n\nthe island [Norfolk Island] can be annexed to the Commonwealth or the \n\nadministration can be vested in the Commonwealth Government”. \n\n(Refer: copy of letters -  Attachment no. 2) \n\nWhere is that British legislation? \n\n▪  Secondly, The Commonwealth Federal Parliament enacted the 16th statute  - Pacific \n\nIsland Labourers Act 1901.  Up until 1970s when the Australian Government ended \n\nthe ‘White Australia Policy’, indigenous Norfolk Islanders were not wanted in \n\nAustralia.   \n\nPage 4 of 6\n\n\n--- Page 53 ---\n\n▪  The Commonwealth Parliament enacted the Norfolk Island Acceptance Act 1913 \n\n(Commonwealth of Australia) assented to by the then Governor General of Australia \n\non 19th December 1913 (Act No. 15 of 1913). \n\n▪  For the enactment of that 1913 legislation the Commonwealth of Australia \n\n(Australian Government) relied upon section 122 of the Commonwealth of Australia \n\nConstitution. \n\n▪  Section 3 of the 1913 acceptance legislation declares Norfolk Island to be accepted \n\nby the Commonwealth of Australia as a ‘territory under the authority of the \n\nCommonwealth by the name of Norfolk Island’.   \n\n▪ \n\nIt is important to note and accept that ‘declaration’ had no legal force in 1913. \n\n▪  Section 122 Government of Territories of the Australian Constitution: \n\no  The Parliament may make laws for the government of any territory \n\nsurrendered by any State in and accepted by the Commonwealth, or of any \n\nterritory placed by the Queen under the authority of and accepted by the \n\nCommonwealth, or otherwise acquired by the Commonwealth, and may \n\nallow the representation of such territory in either House of the Parliament to \n\nthe extent and on the terms which it thinks fit.” \n\no  The proper process for section 122 is that: \n\n▪  Norfolk Island to be “placed” offered \n\n▪  The Commonwealth of Australia to have then “accepted” the offer. \n\n▪  This is not the process the Commonwealth of Australia did. \n\n▪  Therefore, the Commonwealth of Australia has overstepped its \n\nauthority in terms of its possession by any constitutional power of \n\nNorfolk Island through making an acceptance law based on section \n\n122 of the Australian Federal Constitution. \n\n▪  That 1913 legislation is invalid in law. \n\n▪ \n\nIt is also important to accept that the Australian Government 1913 legislation (as \n\nreferred to herein) does not mention any other Australian Government Constitutional \n\nbasis upon which Australia may have relied upon to enact the 1913 legislation.  For \n\nexample:  telecommunications, postal (section 51(v), defence (section 51(vi),  \n\n▪ \n\n In fact, section 51 of the Australian Constitution has no mention whatsoever in the \n\n1913 legislation for Norfolk Island and was not relied upon by the Australian \n\nGovernment in 1913 for the purported Australian enactment for Norfolk Island.  \n\nPage 5 of 6\n\n\n--- Page 54 ---\n\n▪  The Fugitive Offenders Act 1881 - Imperial Order in Council No. 1031 of 1925 \n\nidentifies Papua and Norfolk Island still being a British Crown possession. \n\n▪  The Chamber is certain  His Majesty the King as well as the Imperial Privy Council \n\nwould not have made such a major legal blunder to refer to Norfolk Island as a \n\nBritish Possession, (as mentioned above) and also it to be  placed under the \n\nauthority of the Commonwealth of Australia as the Australian government now \n\ncontends ownership, control of Norfolk Island as transferred in 1914. \n\n▪  The Norfolk Island Act 1979 preamble has the supposedly legal history of Norfolk \n\nIsland, governing under the authority of the Commonwealth of Australia, and noting \n\nthe role of the Pitcairn Settlers for the settlement of Norfolk Island on 8 June 1856.  \n\n▪  But from 2015 to the present day, it is obvious the Commonwealth of Australia has \n\nbecome determined to remove from Norfolk Island’s history and also legislative \n\nrecords the history of the Pitcairn Settlers / Norfolk Islanders as well as the legal and \n\nlawful truth that: \n\nNorfolk Island is a distinct and separate Colony \n\nas by acts of the British Parliament. \n\n“An Act to amend so much of an Act of the last Session for the Government of \n\nNew South Wales and Van Diemen’s Land as relates to Norfolk Island” \n\n“An Act to repeal the Acts of Parliament now in force respecting the disposal \n\nof Waste Lands of the Crown in Her Majesty’s Australian Colonies and to \n\nmake other provisions in lieu thereof” \n\nIt is obvious today, as it was in 1920s when discussions were held between British \n\nGovernment officials with the then Prime Minister of Australia that the Commonwealth of \n\nAustralia (Australian Government) did NOT receive any ownership or legal title to Norfolk \n\nIsland at any time from 1914 onwards and the position and policy is that Norfolk Island \n\nremains a distinct and separate colony as given by Her Majesty Queen Victoria in 1856. \n\nNorfolk Island Chamber of Commerce Committee \n\nEmail:  \n\n17th September 2024 \n\nPage 6 of 6 \n\ns 47F\n\n\n--- Page 55 ---\n\nNorfolk Island Chamber of Commerce  \n\nOpen Submmission: \n\nADDENDUM to  \n\nSubmission to the  \n\nNorfolk Island Governance Committee \n\n“Proposed Preamble” \n\nIn 1914 for the first time in the Commonwealth of Australia Federal Parliament there was a \n\nDouble Dissolution. \n\n1914—the deadlock was broken by the Government losing its majority in the House as a \n\nresult of the double dissolution election. The legislation was not reintroduced. \n\nhttps://www.aph.gov.au/about_parliament/house_of_representatives/powers_practice_and_\n\nprocedure/00 - infosheets/infosheet 18 - double dissolution \n\nAustralian Government documents show that this process commenced in June 1914, \n\n“At a private interview with the Governor-General on the 2nd June [1914] the Prime \n\nMinister (Mr Cook) speaking for his Government, made a general statement, and \n\nsubmitted three memoranda setting out the reasons why the Cabinet considered the \n\ndouble dissolution should be granted.” \n\n and then \n\n “on 30th July 1914, for the first time in the history of the Commonwealth, the \n\nGovernor-General exercised the power vested in him under section 57 of the \n\nConstitution and dissolved simultaneously both Houses of the Federal Parliament.” \n\nPage 1 of 2\n\n\n--- Page 56 ---\n\nThat situation and the following must be considered for not only the 1st \n\nJuly 1914 proclamation in association with the Norfolk Island Act 1913 \n\nbut also the legal and lawful authority that the Commonwealth of \n\nAustralia claims over Norfolk Island. \n\nThe Australian Associated Chambers of Commerce in February 1913 requested the \n\nGovernor-General to transmit to the Secretary of State (S/S) protesting against the \n\nCommonwealth Navigation Bill receiving assent. \n\nThe Governor-General was advised by the Commonwealth Attorney-General \n\n “That His Excellency was under no duty to forward the message and that for \n\nconstitutional reasons Ministers were opposed to its being forwarded by the \n\nGovernor-General.” \n\nIn a dispatch ‘secret’ July 1913 the case was referred to the S/S. \n\nThe ruling given was \n\n“every British subject has the right of appeal to H.M., and that while there is nothing \n\nin Royal Instructions which requires a Governor-General to forward message of this \n\nnature to the Colonial office, Colonial office Regulations Nos 212 and 215 laid down \n\nthat it was the duty of a Governor to transmit to the S/S all petitions to the Throne \n\nand all messages addressed to S/S for the Colonies or H.M’s Government.” \n\nDid all the petitions from Norfolk Island residents get sent to Her /His Majesty? \n\nNorfolk Islanders and descendants of the Pitcairn Settlers are British subjects  \n\nNorfolk Island is a distinct and separate Colony  \n\nNorfolk Island Chamber of Commerce Committee \n\nEmail:  \n\n17th September 2024 \n\nPage 2 of 2 \n\ns 47F\n\n\n--- Page 57 ---\n\nFrom:\nTo:\nCc:\nSubject:\nDate:\n\nLegal Services Mailbox\n\nLegal Services Mailbox\nFW: AEC - Norfolk Island [SEC=OFFICIAL]\nTuesday, 26 March 2024 5:31:29 PM\n\nDear Ms Buffett\nI acknowledge receipt of your email below and advise the AEC has nothing further to add to my\nearlier correspondence of 15 February 2024.

I provide you with just a snippet of\nevidence that Norf'k Ailen (also known as Norfolk Island) is not part of the\nCommonwealth of Australia and the Australian Government has no authority to\nadminister or have control of the aliens land, sea and air, including the EEZ\n\nThese quotes below are from Australian Government documents.\n\nSo I would suggest the Australian Electoral

With all due respect to Mr. Johnson the \nAustralian Electoral Commission is acting illegally and unlawfully in relation to \nincluding indigenous Norfolk Islanders who live on Norfolk Island in the Australian \nElectoral role. \n\nIn reference to your paragraph -    “As the AEC has previously advised the Norfolk \nIsland Chamber of Commerce, the matters you raise are matters for the \nCommonwealth Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development, \nCommunications and the Arts (responsible for territories and Norfolk Island), the \nAttorney-General’s Department (responsible for Constitutional matters) and the \nDepartment of Home Affairs (responsible for citizenship).” This is incorrect, it is a \nmatter for all departments, agents of the Australian Government, and  including all \npoliticians of the Australian Parliament. \n\nYour letter states:  “The High Court held in Berwick Ltd v Gray [1976] HCA 12 that \nNorfolk Island forms part of the Commonwealth. In 2007, the High Court further \ndismissed a challenge by Norfolk Islanders in Bennett v Commonwealth [2007] HCA 18 \nregarding the validity of Commonwealth legislation requiring persons to vote in \nNorfolk Island elections. Granting electoral rights on the basis of Australian citizenship \n\nNorfolk Island Chamber of Commerce,   Norfolk Island                     Email:   norfolkisland.coc@gmail.com\n\n\n--- Page 112 ---\n\nto Norfolk Islanders was held as a valid exercise of Parliament’s power to make laws \n“for the government of any territory” under section 122 of the Constitution.”   \n\nThe Norfolk Island Chamber of Commerce provides the following answer to that \nstatement: - \n\nOver the years various court cases have mentioned the legal status of Norfolk \nIsland, but they have been found to be limited in declaration of the status or \nsituation for Norfolk Island to the facts of the case or law being dealt with. \nBennett v the Commonwealth 2007 was an Australian federal electoral voting \npower case \nFor years Commonwealth of Australian government officials have referred to \nthe Berwick Ltd v Gray – that Norfolk Island was a part of Australia thereby the \nAustralian Government official position that Norfolk Island “belongs” to \nAustralia. That is misinformation. \nBerwick has since been declared limited to the question of whether – Norfolk \nIsland can be subject to Australian taxation laws and no more. \nIndeed, in part of paragraph [177] of the High Court of Australia judgement \nBennett v the Commonwealth case, Justice Callinan (as His Honour then was) \nand which does not seem to have been disagreed with by other High Court \njudges in the Bennett v The Commonwealth case: -  \n\n“On acceptance by Australia, Norfolk Island was a Crown possession or \ndependency which had been established as a distinct and separate \nsettlement for occupation by Pitcairners and their descendants, and others \nadmitted to their community.  Norfolk Island did not on its acceptance by \nAustralia, nor has it since, become part of Australia, geographically or \npolitically.  Statements to the contrary in Berwick Ltd v Gray [198] are \nwrong.  Its community is not and has never been part of the Australian \ncommunity.  Australian citizenship has never been a determining factor in \nidentifying the community of the island.” \nIn the Bennett case High Court Australian Justices had reservations about \nany attempt by the Commonwealth of Australia and others to rely on \nBerwick Ltd v Gray as the main reason for any claim by the Commonwealth \nof Australia that Norfolk Island was a part of that country for all reasons \nrather than just for Australian Government taxation. \n\nNorfolk Island Chamber of Commerce,   Norfolk Island                     Email:   norfolkisland.coc@gmail.com\n\n\n--- Page 113 ---\n\nReference Commonwealth of Australia Constitution and Section 122.  This is \ncompletely irrelevant in relation to Norfolk Island.  There was no Imperial legislation \n(as evidence shows In British documents) in 1913 to allow for Norfolk Island to be \n“PLACED” for then the Commonwealth Government to “ACCEPTED”.  Separate to that \nthere are also other legal and lawful reasons why Norfolk Island is not part of and \ncannot be administered by the Commonwealth of Australia. \n\nThe Norfolk Island Chamber of Commerce now requests the Australian Electoral \nCommission to rectify this unlawful and illegal matter forthwith. \n\nSincerely, \n\nCherri Buffett \nPresident  \nfor \nNNorfolk Island Chamber of Commerce Committee \nNorfolk Island Chamber of Commerce \n\n_Disclaimer_ \nThis message and the information therein is for the recipient only and may contain confidential and/or legally privileged \nmaterial.

This Act requires Australian citizens residing in Norfolk Island who are over the age of 18 to be\nenrolled and vote in federal elections. Failure to enrol or vote may lead to an administrative penalty or\nprosecution in court.\n\nYour correspondence raised concerns regarding the High Court decisions Berwick Lid v Gray [1976]\nHCA 12 and Bennett v Commonwealth [2007] HCA 18 (‘Bennett’), by referring to a paragraph of\nJustice Callinan’s judgment in Bennett set out the plaintiffs submissions in that case. If you read that\ndecision, you will see that Justice Callinan rejected the plaintiffs submissions (see paragraph 178 of\nBennett) and agreed with the other members of the High Court that Commonwealth laws can apply to\nNorfolk Island.\n\nThe Australian Electoral Commission does not intend to engage in any further correspondence on\nthis matter with the Norfolk Island Chamber of Commerce. Should you wish to pursue any other\nconcerns on the administration of Norfolk Island, | encourage you to direct these matters to the\nresponsible Commonwealth department as outlined in the Administrative Arrangements Order.\n\n| look forward to the full participation of all eligible citizens residing on Norfolk Island in the 2025\nfederal election.\n\nSection 47F\n\n   \n\nJeff Pope\nActing Electoral Commissioner\n3 February 2025\n\n10-12 Mort Street, Canberra ACT 2600 P02 6271 4411 WWW.aeC.govV.au\n\n\n--- Page 115 ---\n\nFrom:\nTo:\nBcc:\nSubject:\nDate:\n\nLegal Services Mailbox\nnorfolkisland.coc@gmail.com\n; \n\n; Andrew Johnson\n\nRE: Australian Government Federal elections - reply requested (LEX7954) [SEC=OFFICIAL]\nThursday, 17 April 2025 4:41:23 PM\n\nDear Chamber Committee\n\nThe Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) is a statutory authority that is required to administer\nfederal election events in accordance with the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918.
