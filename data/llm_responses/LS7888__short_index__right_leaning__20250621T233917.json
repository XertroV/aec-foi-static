  "prompt": "From a right-leaning perspective, provide a concise, single-paragraph summary in markdown format of the following FOI request overview:\n\nSummary:\n\nThe Australian Electoral Commission's (AEC) efforts to reform its Indigenous Electoral Participation Program (IEPP) methodology during 2018-2019, as revealed by these FOI documents, present a mixed picture when viewed through a conservative lens. While ostensibly aimed at improving electoral integrity and participation, the actions highlight areas of concern regarding fiscal responsibility, individual liberty, and the scope of government.\n\n**Economic Efficiency and Fiscal Responsibility:**\nThe documents indicate a shift by the AEC from less reliable \"indirect estimation\" methods to a \"more direct method\" of calculating Indigenous enrolment rates, primarily by leveraging self-identified Indigeneity data from the Department of Human Services (Centrelink). This is presented as leading to \"more robust results.\" From an efficiency standpoint, utilizing existing government data sources, rather than developing entirely new collection mechanisms, could be seen as a sensible approach to resource allocation. However, a significant deviation from conservative principles of fiscal transparency is evident: the FOI request explicitly sought details on the \"final cost of the design, testing and implementation of the new methodology\" and the \"number of AEC staffers assigned,\" yet **no such financial or staffing information is provided in the released documents.** This lack of accountability for public expenditure on a new program or methodology is a serious concern, preventing a proper cost-benefit analysis and hindering oversight of taxpayer funds. The mention of \"enrolment stimulation events\" in February/March 2019, which led to the enrolment of 2,646 Indigenous Australians, represents a direct programmatic expense whose cost remains undisclosed.\n\n**Individual Liberty and Limited Government:**\nThe core of the new methodology relies on the AEC accessing and matching individuals' self-identified Indigenous status from Centrelink records with the electoral roll. While the AEC states that the electoral roll itself \"does not have a personal Indigenous identifier,\" this inter-agency data sharing effectively creates a de facto administrative identifier, raising significant questions about data privacy and the expanding reach of government. For conservatives, who advocate for limited government and strong protections for individual liberty, the aggregation and cross-use of personal data across different government functions (welfare administration and electoral management) can be viewed as an encroachment on privacy. The stated purpose of this data use, to \"enhance Indigenous enrolment\" for \"Closing the Gap purposes,\" while presented as a social good, also highlights an expansion of the AEC's role beyond its core function of maintaining an accurate and fair electoral roll to active participation in social engineering outcomes. This active pursuit of specific demographic enrolment rates, rather than a neutral, universal application of electoral law, deviates from the principle of a strictly limited government.\n\n**Outcomes and Deviations:**\nThe new methodology has reportedly led to an increase in estimated national Indigenous enrolment rates, rising from a previously \"alarmingly low\" 58% (2014) to 76.4% in June 2018 and 76.6% in June 2019. While an overall improvement in enrolment is desirable for a robust democracy, the internal documents also highlight an 11% increase in the estimated *unenrolled* Indigenous population in New South Wales between 2018 and 2019, prompting internal questions about the data's nuances. This fluctuation, coupled with the inherent \"courageous assumptions\" acknowledged in the methodology, reinforces the conservative view that complex government interventions, particularly those involving extensive data aggregation and social objectives, often lack precision and can obscure true efficacy while increasing administrative burden and reducing transparency.\n\nIn conclusion, these documents reveal the AEC's initiative to improve Indigenous electoral participation through a data-driven methodology. However, the undisclosed costs, the reliance on cross-agency data sharing impacting individual privacy, and the broader \"Closing the Gap\" mandate that pushes the AEC into social policy territory, represent significant deviations from conservative principles of fiscal responsibility, individual liberty, and limited government. The lack of transparency surrounding the financial aspects of this program remains a key concern.\n\nProvide only the markdown formatted summary text. Do not include any conversational filler or preamble."
