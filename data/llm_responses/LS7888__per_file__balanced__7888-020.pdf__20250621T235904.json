            "text": "This document is an \"Estimates Brief\" from February 2019, providing updated Indigenous enrolment rate estimates.\n\n### Summary of Document\n\nThe document, an \"Estimates Brief\" prepared for Additional Estimates in February 2019, details the Australian Electoral Commission's (AEC) updated methodology and findings regarding Indigenous electoral enrolment rates. Key points include:\n\n*   **Increased Enrolment:** The national Indigenous enrolment rate was estimated at 76.4% as of 30 June 2018, a significant increase from previous estimates of 58%. This indicates a faster growth rate for Indigenous enrolment compared to the overall electoral roll.\n*   **New Methodology:** The revised estimates are based on an \"improved methodology\" utilising more robust data, specifically self-identified Indigeneity data provided by the Department of Human Services (Centrelink) and population data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS). This new methodology will be updated annually.\n*   **Positive Trends (2017-2018):** Between 30 June 2017 and 30 June 2018, the estimated number of enrolled Indigenous Australians increased by 5.1% (from 364,631 to 383,078), while the estimated number of non-enrolled Indigenous Australians decreased by 4% (from 123,517 to 118,581).\n*   **Strategic Use:** The AEC states that these new estimates will inform future strategies aimed at further increasing electoral participation by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people.\n*   **State-by-State Data:** The document includes a table showing Indigenous enrolment rates for each state and territory as of June 2017 and June 2018, demonstrating a positive change across all jurisdictions.\n\n### Relevance to FOI Request LS7888\n\nThis document is highly relevant to FOI request LS7888 as it directly addresses several core aspects:\n\n*   **New Methodology:** It explicitly details the \"new methodology\" for estimating Indigenous enrolment rates, confirming the shift from the 2014 methodology (58% estimate) and the utilisation of Centrelink's self-identified Indigeneity data, a key finding of the FOI request.\n*   **Implementation & Outcomes:** The brief serves as a formal communication of the implementation of this new methodology and its immediate \"outcomes,\" presenting the significantly increased estimated enrolment rate of 76.4% by June 2018, which aligns precisely with the figures highlighted in the FOI overview.\n*   **Planning & Context:** Although not detailing the planning process itself, the document is an output of that planning, reflecting the AEC's internal reporting on the results of its updated approach to Indigenous electoral participation.\n*   **Timeframe:** Dated February 2019, the document falls squarely within the 2018-2019 period specified by the FOI request.\n*   **Program Information:** It states that these new estimates will \"further inform the strategies that the AEC is delivering to further increase electoral participation by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people,\" directly linking the methodology's results to the ongoing Indigenous Electoral Participation Program (IEPP)."

  "prompt": "Considering this document as part of an FOI request, summarize the document and its relevance to the FOI request in markdown format. FYI the overview of the FOI request is: FOI request LS7888 sought documents from 2018-2019 concerning the Australian Electoral Commission's (AEC) new methodology for its Indigenous Electoral Participation Program (IEPP), specifically regarding its planning, implementation, outcomes, Indigenous involvement, and costs. The released documents reveal the AEC transitioned to a more direct method for estimating Indigenous electoral enrolment rates, primarily by utilising self-identified Indigeneity data from Centrelink. This shift, driven by the availability of new Centrelink data, significantly increased estimated Indigenous enrolment rates from approximately 58% (under the old 2014 methodology) to 76.4% by June 2018 and 76.6% by June 2019. The documents detail the new methodology, its impact, and efforts to track enrolment stimulation, including identifying over 72,000 potentially unenrolled Indigenous Australians in mid-2018 and subsequent enrolment events. However, the released content did not explicitly detail the number of Indigenous people involved in the methodology's development or its final costs and dedicated AEC staffing.\n\nDocument Text:\n\n\n\n--- Page 1 ---\n\nESTIMATES BRIEF - Hot Issue \nAdditional Estimates – February 2019 \n\nINDIGENOUS ENROLMENT RATE ESTIMATES \n\nSubject/Issue \n\nThe Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) has prepared Indigenous enrolment \nrate estimates that show an overall increase on previous estimates. \n\nKey points \n\n AEC Indigenous enrolment rate estimates, show an overall increase on\n\nprevious published data and shows that the Indigenous enrolment rate has\ngrown at a faster pace than that of the Roll as a whole.\n\n As at 30 June 2018 the AEC estimates that the national Indigenous enrolment\n\nwas 76.4 per cent.\n\n This new estimate based on more robust data reveals that the estimated\n\nnumber of Indigenous Australians of voting age, who are enrolled continues\nto rise.\n\n In the 12 months from 30 June 2017 to 30 June 2018 the AEC estimates there\n\nhas been:\n\no a 5.1 per cent increase in the estimated number of enrolled Indigenous\nAustralians as a proportion of the estimated Indigenous population,\nrising from 364,631 to 383,078; and\n\no a corresponding 4 per cent fall in the estimated number of non-enrolled\n\nIndigenous Australians from 123,517 to 118,581.\n\n In the same 12 month period the estimated Indigenous voting age population\nonly increased by 2.8 per cent (13,511 electors) from 488,148 to 501,659.\n\n Any gap between non-Indigenous and Indigenous enrolment rates is\n\ndisappointing, however it is encouraging to see that Indigenous enrolment\nrates have improved considerably since the last time estimates were prepared.\n\n This new estimates will further inform the strategies that the AEC is\n\ndelivering to further increase electoral participation by Aboriginal and Torres\nStrait Islander people.\n\nSB19-000015 \n\n1 \n\nLS7888 Released Document No. 20\n\n\n--- Page 2 ---\n\nBackground  \n\nIndigenous enrolment rate estimates \n  Previous Indigenous enrolment rate estimates of 58 per cent were based on the best \n\ninformation we had at the time. \n\n  These new figures are based on more recent and accurate data. Specifically, the AEC has \n\nbeen provided with self-identified Indigeneity data by the Department of Human Services, \nand with population data by the Australian Bureau of Statistics. \n\n  The AEC will be using this improved methodology from here on, and we’ll be updating \n\nthe data every year as part of our annual roll-integrity review. \n \nIndigenous enrolment rate has grown at a faster pace than that of the Roll as a whole. \n  The table below shows the estimated Indigenous enrolment rates at 30 June 2017 and \n\n30 June 2018 by state and territory.
