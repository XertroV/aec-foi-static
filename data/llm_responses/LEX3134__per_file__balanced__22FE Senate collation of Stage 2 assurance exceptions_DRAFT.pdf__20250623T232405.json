            "text": "This document, titled \"Collation of Stage 2 statistical assurance exceptions,\" is part of Axiom Associates' external statistical assurance of the Australian Electoral Commission's (AEC) 2022 Senate ballot papers, directly relevant to the FOI request seeking the audit report on scanning and digitisation accuracy.\n\nIt serves as a detailed companion to the main audit report, specifically outlining the 33 Stage 2 exceptions identified. Stage 2 testing assessed the accuracy of the electronic preference data file in the AEC's Ballot Paper Reconciliation System (BPRS) against physical ballot papers and the alignment of voter intent interpretation with AEC business rules.\n\nThe document categorises and provides visual examples for each exception type, which include:\n*   Voter disenfranchisement (9 instances, 27%): Votes recorded as informal despite valid preferences.\n*   Above The Line (ATL) preference sequence broken too early (8 instances within first six preferences, 3 instances after six preferences).\n*   Below The Line (BTL) preference sequence broken too early (3 instances within first twelve preferences, 1 instance after twelve preferences).\n*   Voter preference sequence broken too late (3 instances): Additional preferences incorrectly recorded.\n*   Vote recorded as formal when it should have been informal (5 instances, 15%).\n*   Incorrect preference type accepted (1 instance).\n\nThe collation provides specific ballot paper IDs and visual evidence for each discrepancy, illustrating issues such as BPRS misinterpreting voter markings, failing to recognise preferences, or incorrectly sequencing preferences, aligning with the FOI request's overview that exceptions often arose from interpreting voter intent."

Do not include any conversational filler or preamble.To aid you, the overview of the FOI request is: [REQUEST OVERVIEW START] The FOI request sought Axiom Associates' audit report on the Australian Electoral Commission's (AEC) 2022 Senate scanning and digitisation accuracy. The released draft documents from July 2022, including a detailed report and a collation of exceptions, outline an external statistical assurance process for Senate ballot papers, ensuring electronic data accurately reflects physical records as per legislation. Based on a 10,103-ballot paper sample, Stage 1 identified 7 instances where scanned images did not exactly replicate physical papers, while Stage 2 found 33 discrepancies between physical ballots and electronic preference data/interpretations in the AEC's system, often due to inconsistent rule application or unclear voter markings, with a national sample exception rate of 0.45%. The detailed report estimates 3.2 to 5.8 exceptions per 1,000 ballot papers nationally with 95% confidence, noting no political bias in the exceptions, which typically arose from interpreting voter intent. The collation document further provides detailed examples and visual illustrations of these Stage 2 discrepancies.\n [REQUEST OVERVIEW END] \n\n--- MAIN DOCUMENT TEXT START ---\n\n\n\n--- Page 1 ---\n\nExternal statistical assurance \nof the Senate ballot papers \n\nCollation of Stage 2 statistical \nassurance exceptions \n\nAustralian Electoral Commission \nJuly 2022\n\n\n--- Page 2 ---\n\nAustralian Electoral Commission | July 2022 \n\nContents \n\n1.

STATISTICAL ASSURANCE EXCEPTIONS  \n\n1.1 \nThe purpose of this document is to provide a collation of Stage Two statistical assurance exceptions as \npart  of  the  2022  external  statistical  assurance  of  Senate  ballot  papers.  This  document  should  be  read  in \nconjunction with the External statistical assurance of the Senate ballot papers: Detailed report and statement \nof outcomes, dated July 2022.  \n\nSTAGE 2 EXCEPTIONS  \n\n1.2 \nThe Stage Two assurance testing compared the physical ballot paper to the electronic data used in \ncounting, contained in the Australian Electoral Commission’s (AEC) Ballot Paper Reconciliation System (BPRS). \nThe second stage testing assessed whether: \n\n▪ \n\n▪ \n\nthe electronic preference data file was an accurate reflection of the preferences recorded on the physical \nballot paper; and  \n\nthe interpretation of voter intent aligned with AEC business rules as stated in the Ballot Paper Formality \nPolicy and Ballot Paper Formality Guidelines. \n\n1.3 \nFor Stage Two assurance testing a total of 33 exceptions were identified. These exceptions related to \nthe accuracy of the electronic preference data file (used in counting) and the interpretation of voter intent. \nDetermination  of  voter  intent  should  be  in  line  with  the  AEC  business  rules  as  stated  in  the  Ballot  Paper \nFormality Policy and Ballot Paper Formality Guidelines.  \n\n1.4 \nThe 33 exceptions have been determined and classified in accordance with the approved assurance \nmethodology. The classification of exceptions is outlined in Table 1. An additional classification of exceptions \nhas  been  included  in  the  table  below  to  reflect  the  assurance  findings.  The  categorisation  of  statistical \nexceptions now includes where an incorrect preference type (including related preferences) was admitted to \nthe count. \n\nTable 1: Categorisation of exceptions related to the interpretation of voter intent  \n\n1.5 \nOf the exceptions used in the statistical analysis, 27% related to where a voter was disenfranchised \nfrom the election. Another 24% related to where the ATL voter preference sequence was broken too early \nwithin the first six preferences. 15% of exceptions related to the counting of an informal vote (i.e., where vote \nwas informal and should have been excluded from the count).  \n\n  External statistical assurance of the Senate ballot papers \n\n1 \n\nCategorisation of exceptions used in statistical analysisNSWVICQLDWASATASACTNTTotal% of totalVoterdisenfranchisedwhereavoteisrecordedasinformalwhenthevoterexpressed a valid preference(s)2211129             27%Abovethelinevoterpreferencesequencewasbrokentooearlywithinthefirst six preferences221128             24%Abovethelinevoterpreferencesequencewasbrokentooearlyafterthefirst six preferences1113             9%Belowthelinevoterpreferencesequencewasbrokentooearlywithinthefirst twelve preferences1113             9%Belowthelinevoterpreferencesequencewasbrokentooearlyafterthefirst twelve preferences11             3%Voterpreferencesequencewasbrokentoolate(additionalpreferenceswere recorded)1113             9%Vote recorded as formal when it should have been informal1225             15%Incorrect preference type accepted11             3%Total exceptions related to the interpretation of voter intent7         8         2         3         5         5         2         1         33           100%CSS state and territory Location\n\n\n--- Page 4 ---\n\nAustralian Electoral Commission | July 2022 \n\n2.
