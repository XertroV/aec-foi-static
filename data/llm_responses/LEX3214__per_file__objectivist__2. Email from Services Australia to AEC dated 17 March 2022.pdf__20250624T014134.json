The arbitrary 1500-member threshold for party registration is a collectivist dictate, stifling personal initiative and impeding the free marketplace of ideas by coercing individuals into providing information for the state's regulatory agenda. This action forces individuals into a compelled form of altruism, transforming them into means to a bureaucratic end rather than respecting them as ends in themselves, and diverting their focus from productive achievement—the advocacy of ideas—to serving non-productive state dictates. From an Objectivist perspective, a political party's legitimacy derives solely from free individual choice, and the state's regulation of such voluntary associations, including their internal affairs and numerical thresholds, is a direct assault on the principles of laissez-faire and a truly free society.\n [REQUEST OVERVIEW END] \n\n--- MAIN DOCUMENT TEXT START ---\n\n\n\n--- Page 1 ---\n\n\n\nProvide only the markdown formatted summary text. Do not include any conversational filler or preamble."
