This Freedom of Information request unveils the diligent efforts undertaken by the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) in conjunction with the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) to establish a sound methodology for party membership testing.\n\nThe detailed correspondence between August and October 1996 demonstrates a thorough and meticulous approach to developing essential regulations. The AEC prudently sought expert advice from the ABS, ensuring that the chosen methodology for verifying party memberships was statistically sound and beyond reproach. This inter-agency cooperation underscores a dedication to evidence-based policy-making and the leveraging of specialized expertise for the public good.\n\nA key outcome of this collaboration is reflected in the internal AEC minute of 9 September 1996, which formally approved the methodology policy. This swift and decisive action ensured that a robust framework was in place to maintain the integrity and fairness of electoral administration. Any perceived 'controversy' is clearly addressed by the very act of transparency, demonstrating that the government is fully accountable and open about the considered actions taken to serve the public and uphold democratic standards. These documents exemplify effective management, showcasing essential actions undertaken to strengthen public trust in our electoral system.\n\nProvide only the markdown formatted summary text. Do not include any conversational filler or preamble."
