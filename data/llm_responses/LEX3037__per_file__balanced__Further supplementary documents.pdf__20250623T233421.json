Twitter acknowledged the request and directed the AEC to its official legal requests submission portal for preservation inquiries.\n\n**Relevance to FOI Request LEX3037:**\nThis communication directly evidences the AEC's proactive engagement with major tech companies, as detailed in the FOI request overview. It demonstrates the AEC's use of direct communication channels with platforms like Twitter to identify and address content of concern (implied by the \"blatant\" nature and AFP referral) in the context of the 2022 federal election, thereby supporting the AEC's aim to safeguard election integrity."

The released documents, featuring an \"Electoral Communications Escalation Scenarios\" guide and extensive communication, detail the AEC's proactive engagement—primarily through its Electoral Integrity Assurance Taskforce—with these platforms. This collaboration focused on identifying, monitoring, and addressing electoral misinformation, disinformation, and non-compliant content through direct communication channels and content referrals, thereby safeguarding election integrity.\n [REQUEST OVERVIEW END] \n\n--- MAIN DOCUMENT TEXT START ---\n\n\n\n--- Page 1 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 2 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 3 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 4 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 5 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 6 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 7 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 8 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 9 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 10 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 11 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 12 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 13 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 14 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 15 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 16 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 17 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 18 ---\n\nAEC Hi \nhttps://twitter.com/\n\n, just flagging this account with you: https://twitter.com\n\nHaven't officially reported the tweet yet but we have passed it on to the AFP as it's very blatant.
