            "text": "## Summary of Document: \"Electoral communications escalation scenarios\"\n\nThis document, prepared by the Australian Electoral Commission's (AEC) Electoral Integrity Assurance Taskforce (EIAT) on 29 October 2021, outlines 11 distinct \"Electoral Communications Escalation Scenarios.\" Each scenario describes a specific type of problematic electoral communication, provides examples, and references the relevant Commonwealth law or policy issue. The scenarios cover a range of electoral integrity concerns, including:\n\n*   **Unauthorised Paid Electoral Advertising (Scenario 1):** Electoral ads lacking proper authorisation, as required by Section 321D of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918.\n*   **Misleading Voter Information (Scenario 2):** Communications likely to mislead electors on how to cast a vote (Section 329, Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918), such as incorrect advice on candidate withdrawal or formal voting.\n*   **Impersonation of Commonwealth Officials/Entities (Scenario 3):** False representation as a Commonwealth body or official (Section 150.1, Criminal Code Act 1995).\n*   **Foreign Influence and Interference (Scenarios 4 & 5):** Communications by or on behalf of foreign persons/entities (Foreign Influence Transparency Scheme Act 2018) and more broadly, foreign interference activity as defined by the Criminal Code Act 1995 (Division 92, Part 5.2), including covert attempts to influence voting.\n*   **Threats of Terrorist Action (Scenario 6):** Electoral communications threatening violence against polling booths or voters.\n*   **Anonymous Communications (Scenario 7):** Unauthorised communications from disclosure entities.\n*   **Defamation and Disrepute (Scenarios 8 & 9):** Communications defaming candidates or bringing Commonwealth agencies into disrepute, affecting public perception of election integrity.\n*   **Hate Speech (Scenario 10):** Vilification based on protected characteristics, with potential relevance to the Online Safety Act 2021.\n*   **Breaches of Platform Policy (Scenario 11):** Electoral communications that may not breach Commonwealth law but violate platform terms (e.g., spam, false news).\n\nThe document serves as a structured guide for identifying and classifying various forms of potentially harmful or illegal online electoral content.\n\n## Relevance to FOI Request LEX3037\n\nThis document is central to FOI request LEX3037, which concerns correspondence between the AEC and major tech companies regarding compliance with electoral law and the 2022 federal election. The FOI request explicitly mentions the release of an \"Electoral Communications Escalation Scenarios\" guide prepared by the AEC's Electoral Integrity Assurance Taskforce (EIAT).\n\nThis document *is* that guide. Its relevance is critical as it outlines the specific types of content and legal/policy considerations that formed the basis for the AEC's \"proactive engagement\" with tech platforms. It details the criteria the EIAT used to \"identify, monitor, and address electoral misinformation, disinformation, and non-compliant content\" through \"direct communication channels and content referrals.\" The scenarios within the document directly informed the AEC's efforts to safeguard election integrity by providing a framework for identifying problematic communications and the grounds for seeking their removal or intervention by tech companies leading up to the 2022 federal election."

Do not include any conversational filler or preamble.To aid you, the overview of the FOI request is: [REQUEST OVERVIEW START] An FOI request (LEX3037) revealed correspondence from early 2022 between the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) and major tech companies, including Meta, Twitter, Google, Microsoft, and TikTok, regarding compliance with electoral law and the 2022 federal election. The released documents, featuring an \"Electoral Communications Escalation Scenarios\" guide and extensive communication, detail the AEC's proactive engagement—primarily through its Electoral Integrity Assurance Taskforce—with these platforms.
