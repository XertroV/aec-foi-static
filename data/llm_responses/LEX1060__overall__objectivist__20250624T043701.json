the AEC Reputation Management Framework. It directly relates to the \nElectoral Integrity: Reputation Management Strategy and is guided by the six principles within that \nstrategy, as reproduced below.  \n\nPrinciple 1: Be proactive in building a positive reputation for the Australian electoral system. \n\nPrinciple 2: Undertake open and regular communication with voters and stakeholders. \n\nPrinciple 3: Position the AEC as the foremost subject matter expert on federal electoral \nprocesses in Australia. \n\nPrinciple 4: Judicious use of language, tone and timing in political, media and social media \nenvironments. \n\nPrinciple 5: Back-up public statements with operational delivery. \n\nPrinciple 6: Actively monitor issues, manage risks, and plan for crisis situations. \n\nThe purpose \n\nThis plan addresses the above principles for the next federal election by outlining: \n\n1.  a program of proactive public relations activities designed to address issues that could affect \n\nthe AEC’s reputation.  \n\n2.  a structure and direction for social media management that will enable active participation in \n\nonline conversations, reducing the spread of procedural disinformation.  \n\nActivities outlined in this plan will complement the broader AEC Reputation Management Framework \nas well as other AEC communication planned to occur for the next federal election as part of the AEC \nPublic Information Campaign Strategy.  \n\nExternal operating environment \n\nAs outlined in the Parliamentary Library paper ‘So when is the next election?’: Australian elections \ntimetable as at January 2020’, the next federal election can be held anytime from 7 August 2021 to \n21 May 2022.  \n\nEntering 2021, as a potential federal election year, Australian media and social media commentary \nwas saturated with observations of the 2020 US Presidential Election and subsequent fallout. This \nincluded numerous court cases alleging electoral fraud and ultimately the violent events at the \nCapitol Building in Washington DC on 6 January 2021.  \n\nAt the time, this commentary drew many comparisons to the Australian electoral system – most of \nwhich were favourable with the overwhelming sentiment that Australians are fortunate to have a \nrobust electoral system that could withstand what they saw as blatant procedural disinformation.\n\n\n--- Page 4 ---\n\nHowever, other comparisons suggested that the claims of electoral fraud could not be disproved and \nthere existed the potential for fraud in the Australian vote.  \n\nGiven the scale of initial interest in the US election, it has the potential to be a significant influencer \non the discussion that surrounds the next Australian federal election. Add to this the increasingly \ncomplex, divisive and immediate nature of mainstream and social media activity (as detailed in the \nElectoral Integrity: Reputation management Strategy) and \ndecreasing levels of trust in public institutions.  \n\nCollectively, this creates an environment with significant \nreputation management challenges. While the AEC does \nnot control every facet of a federal election, the reputation \nof the AEC as the agency entrusted with the delivery of \nthe federal election, is crucial to trust in election results.  \n\nThe effective management of reputation relies primarily \non the integrity built into the delivery of services. As \nrepresented in this image, AEC operations, security and \ninformation combine as key factors in the overall trust in \nthe process, and by extension, the election result.  \n\nThe issues \n\nThere are a number of known potential issues that are being taken into account in the delivery of this \nplan. This includes the potential for procedural failure (AEC operations) but is predominantly \nconcerning areas of likely disinformation. Each issue listed below represents an information risk.  \n\nThis document sits outside of the AEC’s risk management framework, so the issues will not be rated \naccording to the AEC’s risk matrix but rather presented here as further context to the plan. The key \nissues include, but are not limited to, the following.  \n\n•  The potential for low participation \n\no  The estimated federal enrolment rate of approximately 97 per cent is as high as it has \n\never been and likely one of the most complete electoral rolls in the world.  \n\no  However, low levels of institutional trust and recent domestic trends suggest that \n\nturnout is at risk of dropping lower than the 91.01 per cent experienced at the 2019 \nfederal election.  \n\no  Being staged within the nation’s ongoing management of COVID-19 sans widespread \n\nvaccination increases the chance of voter reluctance. The health risks of large \ngatherings, time delays from long queues and general apathy towards the political \nsystem amid the pandemic loom as influences to less turnout.  \n\no  Should turnout decrease further it could be used to question the health of Australian \ndemocracy, or even the legitimacy of results in particularly poorly attended electoral \ndivision contests.  \n\no  Formality rates have been largely stable from election to election in recent times and \n\ntherefore present less risk than the potential for low turnout.  \n\n• \n\nIndigenous participation \n\no  The estimated enrolment rate of Indigenous Australians is significantly lower, at \naround 78 per cent, than the overall national enrolment rate. As is the Northern \nTerritory enrolment rate of around 85 per cent.\n\n\n--- Page 5 ---\n\no  This has been the subject of irregular critical commentary from some stakeholders and \n\nthe media throughout the past 4-5 years.  \n\no  The lower Indigenous enrolment rate is occasionally attributed to, either wholly or \n\npartially, the AEC’s processes. This includes the efficacy of direct enrolment in remote \ntownships, the AEC’s reduced NT staffing presence and the AEC’s lessened in-person \ncommunity engagement activities. \n\n•  Electoral roll integrity \n\no  There is a danger that suggestions could be raised of low levels of roll integrity. While \n\nthere is nothing substantially different procedurally, there have been mid-cycle \nconcerns raised by some media outlets regarding the evidence of identity \nrequirements for enrolment.  \n\no  Accusations could also raise issues present in some international democracies, such \nas suggestions of deceased Australians being on the roll or slow/incorrect update of \nenrolment from third-party records.  \n\n•  Speed of the count \n\no  This is a consistent issue for the AEC, one that would be exacerbated greatly should \n\nthe result be unknown on election night.  \n\no  Compounding the concern is the likely increase of postal voting due to the COVID-19 \npandemic. This will result in more unknown electoral division results on election night, \nincreasing the chance of a high-profile seat or overall result being unknown for a \nperiod of time, in turn requiring patience from the Australian public.  \n\n•  Count integrity \n\no  The potential for operational errors (e.g. transcription errors) aside, there is a \n\npossibility that people with vested interests could suggest fault with counting activities \nbeing undertaken by the AEC. \n\no  This has been seen in other jurisdictions and it cannot be ruled out that this could take \n\nthe form of blatant disinformation.  \n\no  Areas that have been the subject of previous focus include the Senate’s electronic \ndistribution of preferences, changes occurring as a result of fresh scrutiny and ill-\ninformed scrutineer observations.  \n\n•  Postal voting integrity \n\no  Among the potential areas of question or disinformation is the security of postal voting \napplications and ballot papers, verification checks in the process and poor delivery \ntimeframes potentially disenfranchising Australian voters. \n\no  Postal voting or ‘mail-in voting’, as it is referred to in some other jurisdictions, came \nunder scrutiny during the US Presidential election in 2020. This could increase the \nlikelihood of intense scrutiny or disinformation at the Australian federal election, \nparticularly if there are perceived delays or issues with the process.   \n\n•  Queuing \n\no  The tolerance for waiting in a queue is continually decreasing. Queuing is also an \n\nactivity that Australian citizens do not have to engage with often.\n\n\n--- Page 6 ---\n\no  Queuing criticism could emerge in light of this decreased tolerance, the likelihood of \nlonger wait times due to COVID-19 safety measures and/or the more febrile electoral \ncommunication landscape. \n\n•  Voter access (incl COVID-19 safety measures) \n\no  COVID-19 safety measures being implemented could make access to voting options \n\nappear more limited to certain voter cohorts. \n\no  Overseas voting will likely be postal-only with some continued reliance on international \nposting systems that are not only out of the AEC’s control/visibility but are observed to \noften experience delays. This could encounter claims of disenfranchisement.  \n\no  Mobile voting activities will not occur in hospitals or residential facilities. Despite the \n\nincreased postal voting service, this change could potentially draw criticism, \nparticularly in light of the recent focus on aged care sector.  \n\no \n\nIn addition, some voters may be hesitant to visit a physical voting venue due to \nCOVID-19 concerns. This will persist for some despite safety measures being \nimplemented that are now societal norms (e.g. capacity limits, hand sanitiser, hygiene \nofficers). \n\no  The issue of voter access could become extreme should a COVID-19 outbreak occur \nduring the voting period without what is perceived as reasonable alternative voting \noptions being available.  \n\n•  Campaigning activities \n\no  There are significant reputational dangers posed to the AEC by the varying and \n\nevolving campaigning tactics utilised at federal elections, including the prevalence of \nperceived disinformation. \n\no  Chief among the concerns is the expectation of the AEC to be the arbiters of truth or \n\nan enforcement body for a range of campaigning matters (e.g. advertising placement, \ncolour, size, timing and format). \n\no  The potential for foreign influence, or perceptions of foreign influence, is also an area \n\nthat could have a detrimental effect on the trust in Australia’s democracy.  \n\no  The somewhat common perception of the AEC displaying a lack of will regarding \n\ndisinformation (which is actually the absence of legislative remit) causes people to \nquestion the neutrality of the agency, and by extension the integrity of the election.  \n\n•  Conspiracy theories & political partiality claims \n\no  There is an anecdotal increase in the likelihood of conspiracy theories regarding the \n\nelection process being raised and spread.  \n\no  One example is that the AEC is operating in favour of one side of politics in our \n\nadministration of the federal election. This is despite the obvious transparency and \nassurance measures that prevent such an occurrence.  \n\no  Should such claims achieve traction they could be particularly damaging to voter \n\nconfidence in election results.\n\n\n--- Page 7 ---\n\nThe plan \n\nIn line with the AEC Reputation Management Framework’s principles, the plan is to: \n\nCommunicate early \nUndertake pre-election communication that will seek to address the known issues (listed above). This \nwould enable a robust public discussion to occur outside of the election period and potentially take \nthe sting out of any election-time discussion on the topics.  \n\nMaintain communication momentum \nDevelop a consistent and reliable record of communicating openly with the media and online \nfollowers ahead of, and into, the election period. Once fully commenced, regular election-focussed \ncommunication should continue to maintain media relationships and embed an integrity narrative.  \n\nEnable reactive capability \nThoroughly resource the Media and Digital Engagement Section with people, systems, procedures \nand materials to provide the ability to effectively monitor and respond to issues through media and \nsocial media channels.   \n\nExercise reactive judgement  \nAct on the procedures established. Be timely, professional and authoritative in media and social \nmedia liaison around matters of potential reputational damage.  \n\nWith respect to the AEC’s operations on social media, the approach to engagement during the \nfederal election will be to: \n\n• \n\nregularly provide proactive content that is relevant, informative and engaging, as well as \ncontent that anticipates forthcoming process criticism; \n\n•  be responsive to questions and criticisms subject to a swift but judicious review of \n\nclaims, individuals, environmental factors relevant to the issue; \n\n•  be timely, including the use of holding lines where needed; \n\n• \n\n• \n\nrely on facts within a broader concentration on content accuracy; \n\nregularly employ a tone that demonstrates real people are responding and endeavouring to \nbe helpful, while maintaining professionalism; \n\n•  selectively employ a firm tone to debunk procedural myths;  \n\n•  use visual accompaniments to provide context to issues wherever possible; and \n\n•  be active in the monitoring of content both on, and outside of, AEC channels.\n\n\n--- Page 8 ---\n\nStructure and procedures \n\nThe structure and procedures for the AEC’s media and social media management at the federal \nelection reflect a modern communication landscape where these aspects are intrinsically intertwined.  \n\nIt is crucial for effective issues management that the Media and Digital Engagement Section has as \nmuch visibility as possible of the multiple entry and escalation points for issues.  \n\nMedia management \n\nThere will be a single point of advertised entry into the AEC for all media correspondence – the \nMedia and Digital Engagement Section in National Office.  \n\nMedia enquiries and interview requests will be coordinated centrally to ensure: \n\n•  appropriate media team and executive visibility;  \n•  consistent messaging on key issues; and \n• \n\nthe application of media handling tactics as deemed appropriate.  \n\nMedia enquiry handling process – routine matters \n\nThe AEC process for handling a routine media enquiry is quite linear. It typically follows the path \nbelow with a decision made on the necessity of each potential action, according to the context of the \nenquiry.  \n\nEnquiry received\n\nIssue holding line or acknowledgment\n\nResearch undertaken\n- E.g. past responses, journalist history\n\nBusiness area / state office consultated \n\nApproval sought\n\nResponse provided\n\nPost-response internal FYI\n- ELT, business area and / or state office\n\nMedia enquiry handling process – sensitive issues \n\nIn order to provide effective management of sensitive media issues the requirements for each \ninteraction will be assessed based on need and cognisance of the varying requirements for \ntimeliness, application of tone and channel selection. Each approach will take account of the: \n\n• \n\njournalist’s historical reporting, relationship with the AEC and/or general approach;\n\n\n--- Page 9 ---\n\n•  Consultation: potential consultation audiences are as per the advisory audiences. \n\nConsultation may be a simple request for information, a request to craft a draft response or a \nrequest for review of a draft response.  ELT consultation / approval is sought sparingly and \noften at different stages of the enquiry process dependent on need, issue’s sensitivity and/or \nhistory; \n\n•  AEC’s contextual environment;  \n•  potential speed of the issue’s escalation/spread and the journalist deadline; and \n•  other stakeholder considerations.  \n\nFigure 1 demonstrates the key actions that could be taken to deal with an enquiry or issue that has \nbeen raised through AEC media or social media channels. Any of these actions could be utilised at \nany point in time when considering and responding to media enquiries. \n\nIn addition, Attachment A provides a catalogue of channel and tone considerations for handling \nparticularly sensitive issues.  \n\nFigure 1: Media & social media enquiry handling process \n\nBackgrounding \n\nWritten holding line  \n\nContextual research \n\nPost-response advisory \n\nInternal consultation (ELT as required) \n\nImmediate internal advisory \n\nWritten response \n\nAlternative avenues of issue engagement \ne.g. videos, social media, interviews, stakeholder \ncorrespondence \n\nMedia and Digital Engagement Section \n\nSingle point of media & social media entry into the AEC \n\nWritten holding line: deployed to inject a calming, factual presence for varying reasons \nincluding to demonstrate that the issue isn’t being ignored and address an element of the \nissue ahead of further information.  \n\n‘Backgrounding’ phone conversation: used to provide speed of response, to develop or \nmaintain a relationship and to give swift context to an issue that would be hard to convey in \nwritten form. \n\nImmediate advisory: an immediate advisory may be provided to the: national media team’s \nmanagement line, relevant AEC business areas, state office, relevant external agency, \nminister’s office, and/or ELT. The predominate consideration is issue sensitivity \n\nContextual research: this is often the first step and is undertaken to inform how to progress \nwith the enquiry or issue. It includes searching:  \n\n•  Google for individuals or key terms, \n•  AEC social media account activity,\n\n\n--- Page 10 ---\n\n•  Utilisation of media and social media monitoring tools, and/or \n•  The catalogue of past media enquiries \n\nWritten response: timing of this action is a decision made based on the issue \ncomplexity/sensitivity, the historical provision of information, publicly available information, \nand/or the urgency of the issue. \n\nAlternative avenues of issue engagement: consideration may also be applied at any stage \nin the process to utilise the alternative avenues to address an issue that has arisen from a \nmedia enquiry or social media comment.  See Attachment A.  \n\nEC / DEC ‘fast path’ \n\nFor matters of particular subject matter and/or time sensitivity the AEC’s Principal Media Advisor will \nseek either guidance or approval from the Electoral Commissioner directly, and immediately. For \ntimes when the Electoral Commissioner is unavailable, this engagement will be undertaken with the \nDeputy Electoral Commissioner.  \n\nAEC spokespeople \n\nDesignated AEC media spokespeople include the Electoral Commissioner, state and territory \nAustralian Electoral Officers (AEOs) and nominated Media and Digital Engagement staff. These staff \nundergo pre-election media training, as outlined within this document.  \n\nIn line with the AEC’s Media Liaison Policy, the utilisation of other AEC staff members to speak to the \nmedia (conduct interviews) on behalf of the agency is to be undertaken by exception only and with \nprior approval from the Media and Digital Engagement Section or senior executive staff.  \n\nAll media contact not initiated by, or referred by, the Media and Digital Engagement Section must be \ndirected to the AEC’s media contacts available via the website for action and/or discussion.  \n\nState Office Communications Officers \n\nState Office Communication Officers often perform a number of varied communication roles for the \nagency during an election period (e.g. internal communications, complaints management etc). With \nregard to media and social media management, these officers will be a primary point of contact for \nthe Media and Digital Engagement Section for assistance on matters relevant to their jurisdiction.  \n\nMedia enquiries, AEO media interview requests, social media interactions or media event attendance \nrequests may be directed to a State Office Communications Officer by the Media and Digital \nEngagement Section. This liaison will be to either seek relevant information or to request further \ncoordination/finalisation of the matter.\n\n\n--- Page 11 ---\n\nMedia releases \n\nAll AEC media releases will be distributed by \nthe Media and Digital Engagement Section.  \n\nThe Media and Digital Engagement Section \nwill seek advanced business area review of the \nfull suite of election-time media release \ntemplates. \n\nDuring the election period, each media release \nwill be sent through Objective to the National \nElection Manager (NEM) for approval with the \nline-area FAC, relevant branch AC and the \nstate manager cohort cc’d into the request for \nvisibility. With the exception of real-time \nissues, the Media and Digital Engagement \nSection will provide each media release to the \nNEM one day prior to its designated distribution date. Other members of ELT may be consulted \ndepending on the nature of the media release. \n\nElectoral Commissioner approval \n\nIn addition to the NEM, approval for routine procedural media releases that quote the Electoral \nCommissioner will be sought from the Electoral Commissioner – for obvious reasons. Electoral \nCommissioner approval will also be sought for media releases that deal with particularly sensitive \nsubject matter.  \n\nUnplanned media releases \n\nNot all media releases are initially drafted by the Media and Digital Engagement Section – this \noccasionally occurs within business areas, state offices or the Executive Leadership team (ELT). \nHowever, the Media and Digital Engagement Section must always review the content and will afford \nan opportunity for review to the relevant business area or state office as well.  \n\nSocial media management \n\nThe AEC will operate the following corporate social media accounts during the federal election.  \n\nInstagram \n\n•  Twitter \n• \n•  LinkedIn \n•  YouTube \n•  Facebook (x2) \n\no  A general AEC account and an Indigenous-specific Facebook account \n\nThe administration of these AEC social media accounts, and the supporting social media \nmanagement functions discussed below, will be undertaken entirely by the Media and Digital \nEngagement Section. This is in recognition of social media’s close links to issues management.  \n\nThe fast paced nature of issue development online makes it necessary to have close connection to \nthe organisation’s media monitoring capability, the point of entry/coordination for media requests and \nthe team that will be included broadly in relevant operational updates through AEC command centre \nintegration (discussed below).  \n\nThe dangers of unchecked social media commentary \n\nIll-informed online commentary or questions regarding electoral processes have the potential to \nspread very quickly during an election period. This poses a significant risk to electoral integrity.\n\n\n--- Page 12 ---\n\nWhen contained to a relatively small group of like-minded users or a single channel, online \ncommentary itself may have little tangible effect. However, if an issue or a piece of disinformation \npenetrates into a larger audience or multiple channels (including mainstream media) it can have a \nsignificant impact on the narrative of the election.  \n\nIn addition, threats to the election process that extend beyond disinformation, for example physical or \ncyber threats, may be disseminated through social media channels. This provides the need to not \nonly engage on the AEC’s accounts but also to listen to online commentary outside of the AEC’s \naccounts where it is possible to do so.  \n\nSocial Media Operations Group \n\nIt is anticipated that the level of social media commentary requiring assessment during the election \nperiod will be significant. In order to monitor and manage increased traffic the AEC will stand up a \nSocial Media Operations Group (the SMOG).  \n\nThe structure and work patterns of the SMOG is based on previous election experience and lessons \nlearned from the secondment of several staff to Services Australia during the early stages of COVID-\n19 in 2020.  \n\nApproximately ten surge staff members will be on-boarded (labour hire) to be part of the SMOG as \nclose to one week prior to the issue of writs as is possible to predict. The SMOG will operate out of \nnational office in Canberra and work in shifts during the election period with hours of operation \ntentatively set to be 5am to 10pm.  \n\nA minimum of one staff member each shift will be dedicated to triage – simply monitoring incoming \nmentions on the AEC’s social media accounts and electing to ignore, allocate to a user or escalate \nbeyond the SMOG. Other SMOG staff on shift will provide basic responses when applicable, monitor \ntraffic outside of AEC mentions (based on keyword ‘listen’ briefs) and escalate content when \nrequired. Additional SMOG staff will be rostered on during anticipated peak periods with support \nprovided by the permanent members of the Media and Digital Engagement Section.  \n\nSMOG supervision and escalation \n\nRostered labour hire staff (SMOG staff)\n\nAEC staff from non-election business areas\n(Senior SMOG staff)\n\nDigital and Social Media Officer\n\nDigital and Social Media Manager\n\nPrincipal Media Advisor\n\n\n--- Page 13 ---\n\nIn addition to rostered labour hire staff being recruited, senior SMOG staff are being sourced from \nwithin the AEC (from business areas without an active election-time role) to provide the first, \nimmediate layer of supervision. \n\nSenior SMOG staff will be physically seated within the SMOG during business hours, and for \nnominated out-of-hours shifts, to provide direction. In addition to monitoring staff and account activity \nsenior SMOG staff will, upon direction, contribute to the compiling of social media activity reports, \nidentification and escalation of themes, and the curation and use of pre-prepared responses.  \n\nThe entire SMOG operation will be overseen by the Digital and Social Media Officer within the AEC’s \nMedia and Digital Engagement Section. This Officer will be responsible for: \n\n•  pre-populating the social media management tool (Falcon) with social media responses (pre-\n\nelection); \n\n•  setting up and updating Falcon’s ‘listen’ briefs; \n•  on-boarding SMOG staff;  \n•  enabling SMOG staff (equipment, seats, system/software access, rosters etc);  \n•  conducting SMOG staff training; and \n• \n\ninitial escalation of complex/sensitive content into the Command Centre’s Media Hub. \n\nThe Digital and Social Media Manager and Principal Media Advisor are the senior points of \nescalation and will lead the management and curation of content for all sensitive matters arising on \nthe channels.  \n\nFalcon \n\nThe AEC’s social media management and monitoring tool is Falcon, which supports the following \nfunctionality key to the AEC’s social media operation.  \n\n•  Publish: The planning, review and approval flows for proactive content published to the \n\nAEC’s social media channels. \n\n•  Engage: Reactive management of incoming social media messages including triaging priority \nmessages, assigning tasks to specialised users, and pre-scripting responses to common \nquestions. \n\n•  Listen: Monitoring of conversations on key social media channels using keyword briefs \n\ncurated in real time.  \n\n•  Measure: Production of information and statistics regarding activity monitored by the \n\nplatform. \n\nEach member of the Media and Digital Engagement Section, including the SMOG, will have an \nindividual Falcon profile with the appropriate levels of access to functionality.  \n\nSocial media monitoring \n\nUsing Falcon’s listening tool, the SMOG will monitor an evolving set of key word briefs in an effort to \ncapture and review as much relevant social media content as is possible via an automated tool.  \n\nKey word briefs will be reviewed and updated regularly, including as issues evolve. Limitations to this \nsocial media monitoring activity are numerous including the inability to capture content: \n\n•  outside of the core social media channels; \n•  held within platform privacy settings (e.g. Facebook community pages or behind private \n\nTwitter profiles); and \ntypos or incorrectly phrased content that evades the keywords.   \n\n•\n\n\n--- Page 14 ---\n\nApprovals / workflows  \n\nThe considerations and processes for reactive content on the AEC’s social media accounts are \nidentical to the media enquiry handling process outlined within this document.  \n\nBoth mainstream media and social media interactions have the same potential audience and the \nsame potential issues management impact. The primary point of difference will be considerations \nabout the potential speed of spread for an issue – this changes the immediate ramifications of any \nAEC action/inaction and therefore changes decision making.  \n\nCommand centre integration \n\nThe AEC Command Centre will have a Media Hub that accommodates up to three members of the \nMedia and Digital Engagement Section. The Media Hub presence in the command centre will vary \ndepending on circumstances.  \n\nDuring the federal election period (writ to writ) the Media Hub will have at least one Media and Digital \nEngagement section representative present at all times (during business hours and key election \ntimetable milestones). This provides swift: \n\n•  executive visibility and/or engagement on media and social media issues; \n•  Media and Digital Engagement section visibility and/or engagement on operational issues that \n\nmay enter the media or social media space; and \nthe ability to connect with the AEC’s broader crisis management processes.  \n\n• \n\nThe Media and Digital Engagement Section will ensure the appropriate flow of real-time information \nand reporting into the AEC Command Centre through the Media Hub.  \n\nRegular reporting \n\nDuring the election period the Media and Digital Engagement Section will provide the following two \ndaily reports.  \n\nReport \n\nTime \n\nFormat / Content \n\nDistribution \n\nMedia \nmonitoring \nsummary \n\n9am \n(Approx.) \n\nOnline report.

This decision will be guided by necessity \nof awareness or action.  \n\nPublic relations providers \n\nSix O’Clock Advisory is the national public relations provider. They are engaged on a long-term Deed \nof Standing Offer and enlisted via pre-election and election-time work orders to assist with the \nplanning and engagement activities outlined within this document.  \n\nSix O’Clock Advisory will engage local sub-contractors on an as-needs basis to assist in delivering \nspecific requirements. This may include in-person activities undertaken in specific jurisdictions.  \n\nAn integrated approach to communicating the election \n\nThe Media and Digital Engagement Section and Six O’Clock Advisory will work closely with the \nbroader marketing function to ensure an integrated approach to communicating the federal election. \n\nConsideration will be given to how the Media and Digital Engagement Plan, and its agreed activities, \nwill intersect with outputs of other contracted providers including ORIMA Research, Wallis Strategic \nMarket and Social Research, Universal McCann, Cultural Perspectives, BMF and Carbon Creative.\n\n\n--- Page 16 ---\n\nPre-election preparation \n\nPre-election preparation actions ensure the capability of the agency to deliver media and digital \nengagement activities in both the pre-election and election periods. It enables our people and \nsystems to perform effectively when needed.  \n\nMedia contacts / connection \n\nThe Media and Digital Engagement Section will engage with media contacts across relevant \ngovernment departments to seek primary contact details and have an agreed understanding of \nprocesses ahead of an election period.  \n\nA contact list will be developed and include member organisations of the Electoral Integrity \nAssurance Taskforce and others, such as the Australian Department of Health. \n\nMedia feed liaison \n\nEarly liaison will be undertaken with media representatives who traditionally handle the receipt of \nmedia feed data for key broadcast media outlets. This contact will seek early agreement to TCP \nembargo documentation as well as further establishing relationships.  \n\nOther media feed liaison will be undertaken upon request only.  \n\nMedia representative relationships \n\nThe Media and Digital Engagement Section will seize opportunities to establish and/or strengthen \nrelationships with key media personnel through pre-election conversation. This may include private \nsocial media messaging, phone calls or in-person meetings off the back of current events or public \ncommentary.  \n\nThis activity is designed to foster goodwill where possible heading into an election period.  \n\nMedia training \n\nIn order to prepare the AEC’s group of election-time spokespeople, the Media and Digital \nEngagement Section – in partnership with Six O’Clock Advisory - will conduct a range of media \ntraining activities.  \n\nIn-person media training sessions will be offered to all Australian Electoral Officers (AEOs), their \nDirector-level staff members and some national office participants as part of the Operational Leaders \nProgram. Further in-person sessions may also be organised depending on identified need and \nopportunity.  \n\nIn-person media training sessions will provide a mix of theoretical techniques and practical exercises. \nWhere possible, theoretical exercises will mimic the conditions of a real election-time media \ninterview.\n\n\n--- Page 17 ---\n\nWhere possible, State Office Communications Officers will be integrated into the delivery of in-person \nmedia training for familiarity of process and strengthening of relationships regarding media matters.  \n\nRemote media training \n\nAs some of the most active AEC spokespeople during an election period, AEOs will also take part in \nmonthly media interview practice sessions conducted remotely through Microsoft Teams.  \n\nThese regular opportunities will complement the more immersive in-person media training sessions \nby providing an opportunity for regular practice. The monthly sessions will focus on key reputation \nissues for the agency, ensuring that AEC spokespeople are well practised on agreed, consistent \ntalking points.   \n\nA member of the Media and Digital Engagement Section and the relevant State Office \nCommunications Officer will be included in these sessions to assist the spokesperson to prepare for \nthe interview and provide feedback.  \n\nMedia talking points \n\nMedia talking points for an election period are pre-prepared within a series of Issues Briefing Notes \n(IBNs) that are supplied to the full group of AEC spokespeople.  \n\nIBNs are necessarily finalised close to an election period and remain live documents. AEC \nspokespeople can refer to IBNs in order to prepare for media interviews or compile a written media \nresponse. IBNs will be reviewed by business areas and approved by a member of ELT prior to \ndistribution.  \n\nElectoral Commissioner media briefing pack \n\nA media briefing pack will be created for the Electoral Commissioner and maintained throughout the \nelection period. This media briefing pack will contain relevant talking points, statistics, media releases \nand other information as deemed pertinent.   \n\nState office preparation meetings \n\nThe Media and Digital Engagement Section will meet with each state office prior to the election to \ndiscuss the operation of this plan. This discussion will include: \n\n•  An outline of media and social media processes,\n\n\n--- Page 18 ---\n\n•  Agreed understanding of the role of state office communications officers with respect to media \n\nissues management, \nidentification of any local areas of communication concern that may need addressing, \nidentification of any planned local activities for the election period, and \n\n• \n• \n•  Discussion regarding media event management procedures.  \n\nSix O’Clock Advisory will also attend the session as the AEC’s public relations provider to establish a \npositive working relationship.  \n\nFollowing the meetings, the table at Attachment B will be populated and actioned.  \n\nSocial media operations group \n\nThe Social Media Operations Group (SMOG) will be enabled through pre-election preparation of \nrosters, equipment, physical seating plans, software access and training plans.  \n\nThis will be the responsibility of the AEC’s Digital and Social Media Officer.  \n\nPopulating Falcon \n\nSMOG will be further enabled through the population of the AEC’s social media management tool. \nThis will include: \n\n•  a full election period calendar of pre-prepared pro-active social media posts \n•  pre-set reactive responses for known issues,  \n•  creation of a small set of priority and category tags (for reporting purposes), and \n• \n\nthe establishment of a core set of social media monitoring briefs.  \n\nEngagement with social media platforms \n\nThe AEC will re-establish and further cultivate positive working relationships with key social media \norganisations. This activity will commence in June 2021. \n\nIn addition to addressing content referral pathways, these discussions will involve exploration of the \nopportunity for platforms to encourage effective election participation through native, unpaid \npromotional activities. Examples from previous electoral events include distribution of an election day \nFacebook Megaphone to all Australian Facebook profiles on election day.  \n\nFurther information about the AEC’s engagement with social media platforms is contained within the \nAEC’s Electoral Disinformation Plan.  \n\nProduct creation \n\nIn order to communicate on complex issues effectively and quickly, the AEC requires visual products. \nA significant proportion of the period immediately leading up to the federal election will be spent \ncreating visual content that address the key issues anticipated to be prevalent.  \n\nProducts that will be created include: \n\n•  a web tool that depicts the AEC’s electoral integrity journey across the past three electoral \n\ncycles; \n\n•  a mythbuster series of social media tiles; \n• \ninfographics and animations that explain key election processes; and \n•  a series of short-form video content addressing common misconceptions: \n\no  branded as ‘AEC TV’ and featuring staff members from across the organisation. \n\nRefer to attachment C for a list of pre-prepared products.\n\n\n--- Page 19 ---\n\nOur process. Our experts.  \n\nImages: Screenshots of AEC TV videos \n\nImages: Examples of myth busting graphic tiles\n\n\n--- Page 20 ---\n\nPre-election communication \n\nIn order to meet the principles of the Reputation Management Framework, communication regarding \nelection reputation matters needs to commence judiciously. Ideally this would be well in advance of \nthe announcement of a federal election period but must take account of sensitive stakeholder \nconsiderations. \n\nBelow are a range of activities that may, to varying degrees, be implemented prior to the election \nperiod. Consideration of exactly what activities to undertake, and when, will be undertaken in close \nconsultation with the Electoral Commissioner.  \n\nProfessional forums \n\nOpportunity exists for the Electoral Commissioner to use his increased profile, and the increased \nprofile of electoral matters in proximity to a federal election, to host or take part in a range of varying \nprofessional forums prior to the election announcement.  \n\nThis could include convening a think tank or press club event to discuss a pertinent electoral issue \nand/or participating in relevant podcasts or other intellectual forums that are distributed digitally.  \n\nThese forums provide a platform to surface key issues to an audience of stakeholders and media that \nwill potentially be influential during the federal election period.  \n\nMedia briefings \n\nCapital city briefings \n\nThe Media and Digital Engagement Section, with support from Six O’Clock Advisory, will undertake a \nseries of pre-election media briefings – one held in each Australian capital city.  \n\nDirect engagement with senior and reporting editorial media representatives leads to stronger \nmutually beneficial relationships, more confidence in the AEC’s administration of elections, and \nincreased credibility and authority of its leaders and spokespeople.  \n\nMedia briefings will be highly tailored, taking into account a geographic region’s voting profile - \nparticipation rates, understanding of the voting process and electoral system, and attitudes towards \nvoting.\n\n\n--- Page 21 ---\n\nThese insights will shape messaging to ensure information and discussion is appropriately localised. \nBriefings would seek to provide editors, reporters, producers and media executives with a \ncomprehensive overview of the AEC (state and national) and encourage a deeper level of \nunderstanding of media’s role and the contribution it can make to helping achieve higher levels of \nparticipation and voting accuracy in Australia’s electoral system. \n\nTo account for the busy schedules of media representatives, briefings would be staged in outlet \nnewsrooms and boardrooms as appropriate. The following diagram outlines initial thinking of key \ntargets in each capital city.  \n\nReporting guide \n\nThe Media and Digital Engagement Section, in conjunction with Six O’clock Advisory, will prepare a \nReporting Guide as a ‘leave-behind’ resource at media briefings.\n\n\n--- Page 22 ---\n\nThe purpose of the guide is to provide journalists reporting on the federal election with a useful \nresource and encourage accuracy in reporting. The guide will include key statistics, a small sample of \ncommon mythbusters, information regarding key changes since the 2019 federal election and details \nof the range of media services the AEC provides. \n\nThe reporting guide will have both a hardcopy and digital version, with the digital version distributed \nbroadly during the election period.   \n\nEditorial pieces \n\nEditorial pieces will be created and distributed to major metropolitan newspapers focussing on the \nkey issues the AEC would like to surface prior to the federal election period.  \n\nThis may include the key changes to service provisions due to COVID safety measures, changes due \nto any legislative or regulatory amendments, why Australians should brace themselves not to see a \nresult on election night or the rising concern regarding electoral disinformation.  \n\nThe editorial pieces would be drafted by the Media and Digital Engagement Section but ultimately \nauthored by the Electoral Commissioner and, as well as organic publication at the discretion of \nnewspapers, will be promoted via AEC channels. \n\nThe roadshow of media briefings provide opportunity to pitch the offer of regular contributions from \nthe Electoral Commissioner. Agreements (non-paid) could be struck with senior editors of Nine \nNewspapers, Newscorp, Australian Community Media, Private Media and the ABC, just to name a \nfew.  \n\nMedia interviews \n\nAs part of the carefully controlled pre-election exposure of the Electoral Commissioner, the Principal \nMedia Adviser, in consultation with Six O’clock advisory, will seek a small number of interviews with \nspecific journalists discussing key aspects of delivering the federal election.  \n\nThese interview opportunities may be part of a broader program of pre-election communication \nactivity or stand alone as avenues to seed important messages.   \n\nAEC TV – launch & release \n\nAn opportunity exists to launch AEC TV as a public illustration of the AEC’s increased efforts at the \nnext federal election to address disinformation regarding the electoral process.  \n\nLaunching the concept would simply be the distribution of a media release and complementary social \nmedia posts outlining the activity. This would feature the Electoral Commissioner’s ‘Welcome to AEC \nTV’ video as well as commentary regarding other communication efforts being undertaken during the \nnext federal election.  \n\nIn addition, a bank of cut-down episodes could be distributed via tailored pitches to marketing media \n(with the written release) for embedding in media outlets’ digital platforms.  \n\nA launch would not necessarily attract media reporting but rather flag to media and others the AEC’s \nintention to be creative and active in our messaging in acknowledgment of the disinformation \nchallenge.  \n\nStop & Consider video series \n\nPost-launch, there is the potential to create and release a slightly longer form of AEC TV video that \nconcentrates on designated topics that are commonly misunderstood.\n\n\n--- Page 23 ---\n\nThis series could be branded in line \nwith the AEC’s disinformation \ncampaign ‘Stop and Consider’ and \nfeature an interview style piece that \neither reacts to recent social media \ncommentary or anticipates an \nelection-time issue.  \n\nThe videos would be hosted on the \nAEC TV YouTube channel and \ndistributed via social media channels, \nincluding the AEC’s LinkedIn profile.  \n\nSocial media content \n\nIn addition to the AEC TV series, the Media and Digital Engagement Section will focus pre-election \nsocial media content on preparing for a federal election, with a specific concentration on: \n\n•  Enrolment  \n\no  Focussing on overall completion rates, number of people who typically enrol/update in the \n\nfinal week, geographical areas of concern \n\n•  The voting system \n\no  Educational content designed to inform voters about Australia’s preferential voting system \n\nahead of a federal election.  \n\n•  Planning for the election \n\no  Content that provides an inside look behind certain facets of election planning \n\nThis series will utilise relevant AEC TV videos, infographics, existing educational content from the \nAEC website and images from past federal elections.\n\n\n--- Page 24 ---\n\nElection-time communication \n\nElection-time communication will include a mix of planned, proactive activities designed around the \nelection timetable as well as the capability to respond to the environment or issues of the day.  \n\nWebsite homepage messaging \n\nThe AEC’s website is visited millions of times throughout a federal election period, mostly for \nelectoral transactions – this includes enrolment, finding a voting location and seeking results.  \n\nThe homepage is the landing spot for almost all of that user traffic. The website homepage will \ndisplay the most pertinent messages throughout each phase of the election period, providing quick \naccess to relevant information/tools and, where appropriate, displaying a contextual message on \nmatters of reputation.  \n\nThe use of the website for reputational messaging is strongest in the counting period where updates \nand imagery will mimic other channel messaging. Videos and pictures will be used to explain the \ncounting process and illustrate both the scale and complexity of the counting operation.  \n\nMedia releases \n\nA series of media releases will be distributed by the Media and Digital Engagement Section \nthroughout the federal election period.\n\n\n--- Page 25 ---\n\nMedia releases will always be complemented by posts from the AEC’s social media accounts. Not all \ncontent being announced or promoted by the AEC will be the subject of a media release – some \nmessages will be via other avenues, including social media only.  \n\nSee a list of election-time media release templates at Attachment D.  \n\nProactive social media posts \n\nThe AEC’s social media accounts will be highly active during the election period, both proactively and \nreactively. Proactive, unpaid AEC social media messages will include supporting: \n\n-  AEC media releases,  \n- \n- \n- \n- \n\nthe AECs election-time advertising campaign,  \nvarying elements of election participation, \ncommunication on sensitive issues, and \nthe provision of early voting statistics (infrequently, not daily).  \n\nContent will regularly include pre-prepared products (videos, infographics etc). Content will also \nfeature visual products created in real-time.  \n\nVideo updates \n\nAt pertinent stages of the count, short videos will be filmed to provide an update on election planning, \nvoter services and counting activity.  \n\nThis will feature appropriate commentary and imagery that supports the messages of integrity, scale \nand complexity. The video talent and location will be selected based on the contextual environment.  \n\nInterviewees may include the Principal Media Adviser, Electoral Commissioner, a relevant State \nManager, polling staff or even voters. Locations may include count centres, the AEC’s Command \nCentre or the AEC TV studio.  \n\nContent will be vetted by the Principal Media Adviser who may seek further approval depending on \nthe nature of the video.  \n\nStory of the voting period \n\nIn the week immediately following the election, there’s opportunity to use AEC interviews, footage \nand data to reflect positively on how the election was administered.  \n\nThis is a video piece that could be created gradually throughout the election period and released \nsoon after election day. It is an opportunity to tell the story of the election on our terms, in a timely \nmanner.  \n\nMedia interviews \n\nDuring the federal election period AEC Spokespeople will conduct regular media interviews – a mix \nof proactively sought opportunities and facilitating requests. \n\nFollowing what is anticipated to be an active pre-election period of media exposure for the Electoral \nCommissioner, opportunities for Electoral Commissioner media exposure will be sought/accepted \ninfrequently based on identified need.  \n\nIt is envisaged that AEOs will have an active presence both proactively and reactively, noting the \nprinciples of the Reputation Management Framework. An active presence establishes media \nrelationships that can be called on if an issue arises and inserts an AEC voice into what otherwise \nmay be a void of accurate procedural commentary.\n\n\n--- Page 26 ---\n\nMembers of the Media and Digital Engagement Section will not seek proactive media interview \nopportunities outside of an exception. Requests for straightforward interviews will, for the most part, \nbe accepted with a discussion regarding the appropriate spokesperson pending geographic location \nand availability. This is again in recognition of the value of having an active voice.  \n\nPress gallery briefing \n\nIn addition, a briefing, or series of briefings, will be held during the election period for press gallery \njournalists, preferably during the close of rolls period.  \n\nThis will be the same format as the pre-election capital city briefings with the Electoral Commissioner \nin attendance. It will complement other election-time media contact and further seek to seed pertinent \nmessages about the conduct of both voter services and the counting period. \n\nThe Media and Digital Engagement Section and Six O’Clock advisory will coordinate the briefing.    \n\nThird-party engagement \n\nA range of third-party organisations will be identified that would be both appropriate and \nadvantageous to communicate key AEC election messages.  \n\nOrganisations will include tertiary education institutions, targeted workplaces, sporting organisations \nand others. Six O’Clock Advisory will conduct an outreach activity where organisations will be asked \nto assist the AEC, without charge, to distribute our messages via their existing channels (e.g. \nintranet, social media, website etc) \n\nMessages will include temporary election workforce promotion, voter turnout, formality and \ndisinformation. Pre-prepared products and wording will be supplied to make the request as easy as \npossible to facilitate.  \n\nNot all messages will be pushed to all identified organisations, in recognition of both the \nappropriateness of some audiences to only some messages as well as the likelihood of having only \none successful request.   \n\nDirect approaches / pitches \n\nIdentified media will be directly approached for certain issues or story opportunities if identified as \nadvantageous. This may include participation opportunities to highlight certain aspects of the \nelectoral process.  \n\nBehind-the-scenes story \n\nAn identified journalist – either print or television - will be approached for a potential piece going \nbehind-the-scenes of delivering a federal election. The idea is to host this representative in the early \nstages of the election period in order for them to run a piece at the height of potential interest – just \nprior to election day.  \n\nIf the pitch is successful, this would involve a small series of AEC staff member interviews and on-\nlocation visits (e.g. OPCs, ballot paper printing, pre-poll setup and a pre-polling centre in operation). \nThe Principal Media Adviser would coordinate the opportunity with assistance from Six O’Clock \nAdvisory and the relevant state office/s, including the State Office Communications Officer.  \n\nA media piece that described the AEC’s efforts to run a federal election would provide an increased \nunderstanding of the scale and complexity of an event, fostering increased goodwill at a crucial time.\n\n\n--- Page 27 ---\n\nRemote mobile polling opportunity \n\nAs has been traditional across numerous federal elections, the AEC will offer a media opportunity to \nlocal journalists to cover the first remote mobile polling votes cast in the election.  \n\nA location will be selected carefully with all cultural sensitives the subject of prior consultation to \nensure a media visit to the selected rural location is appropriate.  An AEC spokesperson and \nappropriate media representative would accompany the media to the selected location.  \n\nThe aim of this activity would be for coverage of the effort the AEC goes to in order to deliver the \nelection to be syndicated to national media outlets.  \n\nMedia event management \n\nThe AEC has a small number of events during a federal election where media representatives are \nable to, or likely to, be in attendance. It is important to not only be aware of these activities but to also \nappropriate manage them to varying degrees.  \n\nDeclaration of nominations \n\nThe declaration of nominations includes a series of public events that can attract candidates \nthemselves and/or members of the media.  \n\nA single media release will be issued for the declaration of nominations outlining both the \nnominations / ballot draw process and the availability of media attendance – this will be supported by \nposts on the AEC’s social media accounts. \n\nEach State Office Communications Officer is responsible for inputting content for their jurisdiction into \na dedicated Sharepoint site that will automatically populate a webpage that the media release and \nsocial media posts hyperlinks to. This process makes it a nationally consistent and administratively \neasy task to deliver information across 159 electoral contests. \n\nManaging media attendance \n\nEach state office communications officer will identify declaration of nominations events that are more \nlikely to draw media attendance. Through consultation with their state manager and the Media and \nDigital Engagement Section it will be determined which events will require a person to attend to \nperform a media management role.  \n\nThe State Office Communications Officer, a Six o’clock Advisory staff member or a subcontracted \nlocal public relations staff member may attend identified events to greet and, if necessary, curtail \nmedia at an identified declaration of nominations event.  \n\nIt is possible that media will attend a declaration of nominations event that does not have a media \nofficer present. Local staff will manage this attendance and are able to liaise with state office if \nrequired.  \n\nVoting/count centre media attendance \n\nA media alert will be distributed advising that any media representative wishing to visit a voting \nlocation must advise AEC Media of their intent.  \n\nPending an appropriate notice period, all requests received by the Media and Digital Engagement \nSection to simply attend a voting location to take photographs or b-roll footage will be provisionally \naccepted, with guidelines for behaviour provided to the media representative (including COVID safety \nmeasures). It will be noted that we may get back into contact with them if there is an issue visiting a \ndesired location – something that will be carefully communicated.\n\n\n--- Page 28 ---\n\nNote: This approach of providing provisional approval will be re-assessed if the COVID \nsituation in a particular jurisdiction is heightened.  \n\nAny request for a more involved media opportunity at a polling location, or for access to a counting \nlocation, will be assessed on merit and according to the contextual environment.  \n\nAll requests will be logged in a central list categorised by state and territory. Each request will also be \ncommunicated with the relevant state office communications officer who will be responsible for \nundertaking necessary consultation and identifying any issues to the Media and Digital Engagement \nSection in a timely manner.  \n\nThe local consultation will not only identify any potential issues with media attendance at a specified \nlocation but will also provide the relevant Officer-in-Charge at an identified voting venue with \nadvanced notice.  \n\nIn-person media management \n\nThe State Office Communications Officer, a Six o’clock Advisory staff member or a subcontracted \nlocal public relations staff member may attend identified voting or count centre locations to greet and, \nif necessary, curtail media.  \n\nThe need for this level of engagement will be identified based on the profile of a candidate being \nphotographed, the number of media attending, the type of activity being captured and/or the history \nof the media representative in relation to AEC coverage.  \n\nClose counts or recounts \n\nThe media management of close counts or recounts will be carefully considered in consultation with \nthe relevant state office executive and the Executive Leadership Team. It may involve any of the \nfollowing. \n\nthe distribution of media releases outlining the process and progress \nsocial media posts advising updates to the process \n\n-  pitched or reactive media interviews \n- \n- \n-  distribution of short-form videos that advise on count process or progress \n-  Collective picture and interview opportunities at an identified count centre.  \n\nDeclaration of results \n\nFor declaration of results events, a small series of posts will be distributed via the AEC’s social media \naccounts as a means of demonstrating count progress/finalisation and alerting media to the \nopportunity to attend.   \n\nAs per the declaration of nominations process it will be the responsibility of the state office \ncommunications officer to input data into a dedicated Sharepoint site that will populate a webpage \nthat lists the event details. For the declaration of results, this data input will occur as declaration \nevents are locked in.  \n\nThe State Office Communications Officer, a Six O’Clock Advisory staff member or a subcontracted \nlocal public relations staff member may attend identified declaration of results events to greet and, if \nnecessary, curtail media at an identified declaration of nominations event.\n\n\n--- Page 29 ---\n\nEvaluation \n\nThe below are indicators which will determine the success of the Electoral Integrity: Reputation \nManagement Strategy mapped against the AEC’s six reputation management principles: \n\nPrinciple 1: Be proactive in building a positive reputation for the Australian electoral system \n\nMeasure of success: AEC communication on reputational matters provides an evidence \nbase of consistent effort to educate Australians on the election process and address potential \ndisinformation.  \n\nMedia and digital engagement specific: Key audiences are provided with information \nabout the key issues impacting electoral integrity, including election processes and potential \ndisinformation.  \n\nPrinciple 2: Undertake open and regular communication with voters and stakeholders \n\nMeasure of success: Electors and stakeholders have timely access to relevant information \nabout topical aspects of electoral delivery at each point in the electoral cycle.  \n\nMedia and digital engagement specific: Media and social media engagement is timely and \nimpacts positively on individual and collective understanding of electoral processes.  \n\nPrinciple 3: Position the AEC as the foremost subject matter expert on federal electoral \nprocesses in Australia \n\nMeasure of success: The AEC is actively sought out, and thought of, as electoral experts \nand is therefore positioned to diffuse disinformation about electoral processes. \n\nMedia and digital engagement specific: AEC advice regarding procedural matters is well \nreceived or at least clearly assists in steering conversations towards factual accuracy.  \n\nPrinciple 4: Judicious use of language, tone and timing in political, media and social media \nenvironments \n\nMeasure of success: AEC communication regarding reputational matters resonates with \nconsumers as a reflection of an authority that professionally acts within its legislative remit, \nstrengthening positive perceptions of electoral integrity.  \n\nPrinciple 5: Back-up public statements with operational delivery \n\nMeasure of success: Historical statements regarding operational delivery errors are unable \nto be used as the catalyst for criticism in the current environment.  \n\nMedia and digital engagement specific: Public statements made are realistic and in line \nwith executive direction.\n\n\n--- Page 30 ---\n\nPrinciple 6: Actively monitor issues, manage risks, and plan for crisis situations \n\nMeasure of success: The AEC has a robust crisis management plan in place before the \nfederal election. When issues are not known, the AEC becomes aware and is able to act \nquickly. \n\nMedia and digital engagement specific: Media and social media monitoring/management \nactivities contribute effectively to the identification and management of issues.\n\n\n--- Page 31 ---\n\nAttachment A: Issues management tactics \nThere are a range of both proactive and reactive tactics that can be employed by the AEC to manage \nan issue in the media, should one arise during the tight timeframes of the federal election.  \n\nThe table below outlines channels that may be utilised in relation to election related issues. The \ncommunication approach will be selected in consultation with the Executive Leadership Team and \nrelevant state office executive as required.  \n\nChannels \n\nChannel \n\nPurpose \n\nConsiderations \n\nHolding \nstatement \n\nTo address a breaking issue and frame the \nAEC as an agency that is agile and ready to \nrespond.  \n\nMedia statement  To insert AEC commentary into a developing \n\nor continuing issue.  \n\nTimeliness – a holding \nstatement issued regarding an \nalready developed story is \noften seen as a negative.  \n\nScale – should be used for \nsignificant issues only. \n\nThe scale of the issue is a key \nconsideration as remaining \nsilent can, at times, be more \nbeneficial. \n\nFact sheet / \nQ&As \n\nTo provide appropriate background to an \nissue or body of work, potentially correcting \nincorrect assumptions.  \n\nMost effective as an \naccompaniment to more \nsuccinct communication.  \n\nAEC website, \nsocial media \n\nTo provide regularly updated context to an \nissue and to demonstrate progress.  \n\nSpokesperson \ninterview \n\nTo insert AEC commentary into a developing \nor continuing issue, or to set appropriate \nexpectations for a potential issue. \n\nState manager \nor Electoral \nCommissioner \ninterview \n\nTo insert AEC commentary into a developing \nor continuing issue, or to set appropriate \nexpectations for a potential issue.  \n\nThe AEC Twitter account \neffectively acts as a direct \nchannel with media.  \n\nImportant to identify the \nappropriateness of providing a \ngeneric spokesperson in \nresponse to the specific issue. \n\nOften appropriate to use in \nresponse to requests until an \nissue develops into a more \nserious matter and is \ncontinuing despite AEC \ncommentary.   \n\nOutlet selection and interview \npreparation is crucial.  \n\nEspecially important to \nundertake for more serious \nissues to get cut through.  \n\nProactive \ninterview pitch \n\nTo assist in controlling the narrative of a \npotential future issue. \n\nOutlet/journalist selection is \ncrucial.  \n\nParticularly effective in setting \nexpectations for an upcoming \nprocess.\n\n\n--- Page 32 ---\n\nChannel \n\nPurpose \n\nConsiderations \n\n‘On location’ \nfilming/interview \nopportunity \n\nTo assist in controlling the narrative of a \npotential issue or to facilitate positive \nprocedural reportage of a process receiving \ncriticism.  \n\nCareful controls must be in \nplace to facilitate a smooth \nevent, including appropriate \non-site staff briefing.   \n\nEditor’s letter \n\nTo respond to criticism and turn the \nnarrative. \n\nStakeholder \nletters \n\nTo advise key stakeholders of the AEC’s \nactions in response to an issue to minimise \nthe potential for third party media criticism.  \n\nElector letters \n\nTo communicate directly with the people \naffected by an issue, demonstrating \ncommitment to an issue’s resolution and \ngenuine concern for the impact.  \n\nAdvertising \n\nTo gain the attention of both electors and \nstakeholders regarding an issue, \ndemonstrating commitment to an issue’s \nresolution and genuine concern for the \nimpact.  \n\nAEC TV video \n\nTo outline the AEC’s approach to a process \nand/or respond to an emerging issue.  \n\nEffective when blatant \nunfounded criticism is \npublished by a high-profile \nindividual or outlet.
