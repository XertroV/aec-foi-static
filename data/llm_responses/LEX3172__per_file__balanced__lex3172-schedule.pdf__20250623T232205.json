All listed documents are dated between 8 August 1996 and 29 October 1996. They describe correspondence and internal records related to the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) and Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) concerning membership testing methodology, specifically detailing advice from the ABS to the AEC, AEC internal approval of policy, and related exchanges.\n\n**Relevance to FOI Request:**\n\nThis schedule directly addresses the \"earliest advice\" component of FOI Request LEX3172 by detailing the specific documents from 1996, confirming they represent the \"oldest advice\" provided. The listed items illustrate the collaborative process where the ABS offered expert guidance and detailed information (\"Detailed letter re methodology,\" \"Letter and sample table\") influencing the AEC's internal approval of its membership testing methodology policy (\"Internal AEC minute approving methodology policy\") on 9 September 1996. The document supports the FOI overview's statement that the released records are from 1996 and pertain to this collaborative process, while also implicitly indicating, by the absence of other dates, that no documents for the \"most recent advice\" were provided in this release."
