Therefore, it is impossible to conduct an analysis focusing on issues related to social justice, environmental impact, wealth distribution, corporate influence, or civil liberties, nor can any alignment with or deviation from progressive values be determined from the information provided.\n\nProvide only the markdown formatted summary text. Do not include any conversational filler or preamble."
