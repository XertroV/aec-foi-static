This new approach, integrated into the AEC's Annual Roll Integrity Review, aimed to improve \"Indigenous franchise KPIs\" for \"Closing the Gap purposes.\" Key findings include estimated national Indigenous enrolment rates of 76.4% in June 2018 and 76.6% in June 2019, showing an upward trend, and a successful \"enrolment stimulation event\" in early 2019 which enrolled 2,646 Indigenous Australians. However, the documents did not provide specific details on the number of Indigenous people involved in the methodology's planning or implementation, nor did they outline the final cost or staffing assigned to the task."

  "prompt": "Create a concise, single-paragraph summary in markdown format of the following FOI request summary:\n\nSummary:\n\n## Summary of FOI Request LS7888 Documents\n\n### Main Purpose of the FOI Request\nThe Freedom of Information (FOI) request LS7888 sought documents from 1 January 2018 to 31 December 2019 concerning the Australian Electoral Commission's (AEC) **new methodology** for its Indigenous Electoral Participation Program (IEPP). Specifically, the request aimed to uncover details related to:\n1.  Planning for the new methodology, including its catalyst.\n2.  Progress reports on its design, testing, and implementation.\n3.  How its implementation was tracked, including comparisons with prior methodologies.\n4.  Final summary reports on outcomes.\n5.  The number of Indigenous people involved in its planning, design, and implementation.\n6.  The final cost and staffing assigned to the task.\n\n### Documents from the FOI Request\nThe released documents primarily consist of internal AEC communications and reports, including:\n*   **Emails:** Numerous email threads between various AEC staff members, including Assistant Directors, Directors, Senior Project Officers, and Assistant/Deputy Electoral Commissioners, discussing Indigenous data, enrolment rates, and parliamentary reviews.\n*   **Internal Memos/Minutes:** Such as a Minute regarding the use of DHS (Department of Human Services) Indigeneity data.\n*   **Papers/Reports:** Several undated or dated papers titled \"Indigenous Franchise KPIs using Centrelink data\" and \"Analysis of Indigenous Enrolment.\"\n*   **Ministerial Submissions/Estimates Briefs:** High-level summaries prepared for the Electoral Commissioner or Ministers.\n\nMany listed documents are \"subsumed\" into others, indicating that they were part of a larger, more comprehensive document released.\n\n### Main Content from the FOI Request Documents\nThe documents shed light on the AEC's new methodology for estimating Indigenous enrolment rates, its implementation, and the results obtained during the 2018-2019 period.\n\n#### New Methodology for IEPP\n*   **Catalyst and Nature:** The primary catalyst for the new methodology was the availability of **self-identified Indigeneity data from Centrelink (Department of Human Services)**, which the AEC started receiving annually since 2017 (Documents 20, 26, 29, 30, 8). This data allowed for a \"more direct method\" of estimating Indigenous enrolment rates, replacing a less robust \"regression model\" used in 2014 which yielded \"alarmingly low\" figures (Documents 26, 29, 30, 8). The new approach was seen as an \"excellent opportunity\" to improve the estimation of \"Indigenous franchise KPIs\" for \"Closing the Gap purposes\" (Documents 26, 29, 30, 8).\n*   **Methodology Details:** The process involves:\n    1.  Calculating the proportion of Centrelink customers (with identified Indigenous/non-Indigenous status) who are on the Electoral Roll.\n    2.  Adjusting these raw rates by comparing them to the overall AEC enrolment rate.\n    3.  Applying this adjustment to derive estimated Indigenous and non-Indigenous enrolment rates (Documents 26, 29, 30, 8).\n    *   It's noted that the method still relies on \"courageous assumptions\" and results are \"indicative only\" (Documents 26, 29, 30, 8).\n\n#### Planning and Implementation Tracking\n*   Initial discussions about using Centrelink data for Indigenous enrolment occurred as early as March 2018, involving various AEC branches (Document 4).\n*   The AEC integrated the Centrelink data matching into its **Annual Roll Integrity Review (ARIR)** (Documents 26, 29, 30, 8).\n*   An \"enrolment stimulation event\" was conducted in February/March 2019, targeting identified unenrolled Indigenous Australians from the 2018 Centrelink dataset, resulting in **2,646 Indigenous Australians enrolling** (Documents 26, 29). This indicates a direct application and tracking of the new methodology's output.\n*   Internal emails demonstrate ongoing analysis and refinement of the data, with staff identifying and fixing discrepancies in calculations (Document 37).\n\n#### Enrolment Rate Outcomes and Comparisons\n*   **Improved Estimates:** The new methodology revealed a significant increase in estimated Indigenous enrolment rates compared to previous figures (e.g., 58% in 2014).\n*   **Key Figures:**\n    *   As at 30 June 2018, the estimated national Indigenous enrolment rate was **76.4 per cent** (Document 20, 26, 29).\n    *   As at 30 June 2019, this rate slightly increased to **76.6 per cent** (Document 37, 40, 41), continuing an \"upward trend\" from 74.7% in 2017 (Document 40).\n    *   Despite the overall increase, the estimated number of unenrolled Indigenous Australians nationally grew from 118,581 (2018) to 120,486 (2019), a 1.6% increase (Document 40). Specific state variations were noted, such as a 10.9% increase in unenrolled Indigenous population in NSW between 2018 and 2019, although the overall percentage decrease in enrolment rate was marginal (Document 40).\n*   The documents include tables breaking down estimated Indigenous enrolment rates by state/territory and electoral division (Documents 26, 29, 37).\n\n#### Information Not Found\n*   The released documents **do not provide specific details** regarding the \"number of Indigenous people involved by the AEC in the planning, design and implementation\" of the new methodology (Request Point 5).\n*   Similarly, there is **no documentation outlining the \"final cost\"** of the design, testing, and implementation, nor details of the \"number of AEC staffers assigned\" to the task (Request Point 6).\n\nProvide only the markdown formatted summary text. Do not include any conversational filler or preamble."
