            "text": "This document, titled \"Phone Voting for COVID Isolating customers\" and dated 1 March 2022, outlines the proposed \"Customer Journey\" for a secure telephone voting service designed for electors required to self-isolate due to COVID-19. It details a two-stage process:\n\n1.  **Registration Service (Online/Phone)**: Voters register online or via phone, providing personal details for verification against the electoral roll and answering eligibility questions related to their isolation status. Eligible voters receive a unique registration number and a self-chosen PIN, along with instructions to view ballot paper information.\n2.  **Voting Service (Phone)**: Voters call a dedicated voting line, providing their registration number and PIN to a Service Officer (SO) to maintain anonymity. The SO conducts real-time checks to ensure the voter has not previously voted and identifies the correct electorate. The SO then physically marks the voter's preferences on a ballot paper, marks the voter off the electoral roll in the system, and places the completed ballot paper into a secure envelope and ballot box.\n\nThis document is highly relevant to the FOI request LEX2846 as it directly illustrates the AEC's \"extensive preparations\" for conducting federal elections amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. It serves as one of the \"detailed 'Customer Journey' plans\" mentioned in the request overview, specifically supporting the implementation of the **Commonwealth Electoral (COVID Enfranchisement) Regulations 2022** for the secure telephone voting system. It provides operational detail on the new voting methods, outlining the logistical steps, the roles of staff, and the mechanisms designed to maintain the integrity of the vote, such as anonymous registration and real-time voter verification."

Do not include any conversational filler or preamble.To aid you, the overview of the FOI request is: [REQUEST OVERVIEW START] The FOI request LEX2846 illuminated the Australian Electoral Commission's (AEC) extensive preparations for conducting federal elections amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. Released documents detailed the **Commonwealth Electoral (COVID Enfranchisement) Regulations 2022**, establishing a secure telephone voting system for eligible self-isolating voters diagnosed close to polling day, supported by detailed \"Customer Journey\" plans and staff scripts. The AEC also adapted its **postal voting policy** for COVID-positive individuals and noted reduced mobile polling. Revealed were significant **logistical and financial challenges**, including projected cost increases and staffing difficulties, prompting the AEC to seek greater legislative flexibility for emergency election management. The AEC ensured **COVID-safe measures** at polling places and maintained the integrity of new voting methods through staff neutrality, scrutineer observation, and robust complaint mechanisms.\n [REQUEST OVERVIEW END] \n\n--- MAIN DOCUMENT TEXT START ---\n\n\n\n--- Page 1 ---\n\nAUSTRALIAN \n\nELECTORAL \n\nCOMMISSION \n\nPhone Voting for \n\nCOVID Isolating \n\ncustomers\n\nMeet Wendy\n\nWendy is an experienced \nvoter.
