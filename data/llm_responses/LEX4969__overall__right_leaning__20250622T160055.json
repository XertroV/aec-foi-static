            "text": "The provided FOI documents, specifically the letter from Peter Dutton and Michaelia Cash to the Electoral Commissioner, reveal significant concerns regarding government actions that deviate from core conservative principles.\n\n**Individual Liberty and Fair Representation:** The primary concern articulated is the Australian Electoral Commission's (AEC) policy for assessing referendum votes, where a \"tick\" is likely counted as a 'yes' vote, but a \"cross\" is deemed ambiguous and informal. This approach directly undermines individual liberty by threatening to disenfranchise voters whose clear intent to vote 'no' is arbitrarily invalidated. It risks distorting the national vote and failing to accurately reflect the will of the Australian people, thereby compromising the individual's fundamental right to fair and equal participation in the democratic process.\n\n**Limited Government and Impartiality:** The letter critically questions the AEC's impartiality, stating that \"Australians expect the AEC to act fairly and impartially.\" By implementing a rule that gives the 'yes' case an \"unfair advantage,\" the AEC, an unelected government body, is perceived to be overstepping its neutral administrative role. This action deviates from the principle of limited government, which dictates that government agencies should operate strictly within their defined mandates, facilitating democratic processes without manipulating or influencing outcomes. Such perceived bias from a government institution erodes public trust in impartial governance.\n\n**Fiscal Responsibility and Transparency:** While not directly addressing fiscal expenditure, the demand for the AEC to release its legal advice from the Attorney-General's Department highlights a call for greater transparency and accountability from a government agency. A lack of transparency in the legal justifications for such a critical and potentially biased policy decision can obscure underlying inefficiencies or a lack of rigorous adherence to equitable principles, which in turn reflects poor stewardship and indirectly impacts the public's confidence in how public resources and authority are exercised. An electoral process perceived as unfair could ultimately lead to less effective governance and less efficient allocation of resources."

The handbook indicates that while a tick will likely be \ntreated by the AEC as a ‘yes’ vote, a cross on its own is considered by the AEC to \nbe ambiguous, and therefore will be treated as informal. \n\nWith the greatest of respect, this approach is fundamentally lopsided. It risks \ndistorting the national vote. \n\nAustralians expect the AEC to act fairly and impartially in the execution of its duties. \nCounting a tick as a formal vote while simultaneously excluding a cross as informal \ncould artificially skew the count towards the yes vote, and fail to accurately reflect the \nwill of the Australian people.\n\n\n--- Page 2 ---\n\nWe understand that the AEC’s current approach is broadly consistent with the \napproach that it has adopted in previous referendums. However, just because the \nAEC has adopted this approach before, does not mean that it is appropriate or \nlegally correct.  \n\nGiven the AEC’s purported reliance on legal advice from the Attorney-General’s \nDepartment in reaching this view, the AEC should release this advice so the \nAustralian public can properly consider the AEC’s position. We note that any legal \nprofessional privilege that existed in the legal advice has clearly been waived by the \nAEC through its public statements about the advice over many years.  \n\nMore importantly, we call on you to reconsider the AEC’s approach. If a tick counts \nfor yes, a cross should count for no. To do otherwise gives the yes case an unfair \nadvantage, and has the potential to undermine the impartiality and fairness of the \nreferendum. \n\nIt is, after all, in the interests of every Australian to ensure that this basic standard of \nfairness is applied. \n\nYours sincerely \n\nPETER DUTTON \n\nMICHAELIA CASH \n\n24 August 2023\n\n\n\n--- Page 1 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 2 ---\n\n\n\nProvide only the markdown formatted summary text.
