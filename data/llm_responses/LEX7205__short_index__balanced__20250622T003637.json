The released documents reveal extensive interactions, including meeting invitations, email correspondence, and formal letters, detailing how these platforms are collaborating with the AEC's Electoral Integrity Assurance Taskforce (EIAT) and Defending Democracy Unit (DDU). Key themes include countering misinformation and disinformation, managing AI-generated content (AIGC) like deepfakes through detection, labeling, and provenance initiatives, applying lessons from global elections, streamlining referral and escalation pathways for problematic content, and supporting media literacy campaigns. Each platform is actively preparing for FE25 by updating policies (e.g., AI content disclosure), offering cybersecurity tools, establishing dedicated working groups, and facilitating direct communication channels with the AEC to ensure a secure and credible information environment."
