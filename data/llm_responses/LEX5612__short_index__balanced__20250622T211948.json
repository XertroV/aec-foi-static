The documents reveal a chronological overview of activities: initial taskforce establishment and \"mobilise\" phase, significant electronic enrolment surges, candidate nomination updates, managing a threefold increase in postal vote applications and high pre-poll uptake, successful implementation of Secure Telephone Voting, extensive ballot paper distribution, and the impact of the AEC's \"Stop and Consider\" disinformation campaign. It further outlines the successful recruitment of over 100,000 temporary staff, seamless polling day operations, and the steady progress of vote counting, which completed House of Representatives counts and neared Senate completion by June 2022, with high voter turnout."

This includes details on various aspects of the election process, from enrolment and nominations to voting, disinformation management, and vote counting.\n\n### Documents from the FOI Request\n\nThe released documents consist of:\n\n*   **Electoral Integrity Assurance Taskforce Board Meeting Minutes:** These minutes detail discussions and updates from high-level meetings of the EIAT Board, spanning from January 2022 to June 2022.\n*   **Record of Meeting:** These documents provide daily operational updates and discussions from various meetings, also within the same period (January to May 2022).\n\nAll documents were released \"in part,\" indicating that certain sections were exempted under various provisions of the FOI Act, including S 7(2A)(b), S 33, S 34(3), S 37, S 42, S 47E, and S 47F.\n\n### Main Content from the FOI Request Documents\n\nThe documents provide a chronological overview of the AEC's and EIAT's activities and challenges during the election cycle:\n\n*   **Early Readiness & Mobilisation (Jan-March 2022):** Initial meetings of the EIAT focused on establishing the taskforce's framework, roles, and planning for the electoral cycle. The AEC entered its \"mobilise\" phase from January 31, 2022, processing declaration envelopes and assisting state electoral commissions. The AEC also launched its Disinformation Register early in the cycle.\n*   **Close of Rolls & Nominations (April 2022):**\n    *   Writs were issued on April 11, and candidate nominations opened.\n    *   The \"Close of Rolls\" occurred on April 18, with significant electronic enrolment transactions (over 700,000 between announcement and close). Total enrolled voters reached 17.2 million (97% of eligible population), a 1.1 million increase since 2019.\n    *   Candidate nominations closed on April 21, showing an increase in House of Representatives candidates (to ~1120) and a decrease in Senate candidates (to ~390) compared to 2019.\n    *   Concerns were noted regarding political party text messages for postal vote applications (PVAs) and their authorization.\n*   **Voting Operations & Disinformation (April-May 2022):**\n    *   Postal Vote Applications (PVAs) surged, with projections up to three times the 2019 amount. Over 2.8 million PVAs were received by closure.\n    *   Pre-poll voting commenced on May 9, with a high uptake (over 5.5 million pre-poll votes by May 21). The AEC expected around 4 million total pre-poll votes.\n    *   Secure Telephone Voting (STV) was implemented for eligible voters (e.g., blind, low vision, Antarctic, COVID-positive), with registrations reaching over 76,500 by polling day.\n    *   Ballot paper printing and distribution for 50 million ballot papers were on track.\n    *   The AEC's \"Stop and Consider\" disinformation campaign achieved significant reach, with millions of digital and social media impressions, directing users to the AEC's disinformation webpage.\n    *   Temporary Election Workforce (TEW) recruitment progressed, filling over 100,000 positions.\n*   **Polling Day & Vote Counting (May-June 2022):**\n    *   All polling places successfully opened on election day.\n    *   Over 7 million voters cast their vote before election day (via post, STV, or pre-poll).\n    *   Vote counting for both the House of Representatives and Senate progressed steadily. By June 7, the House count was well underway, with 14 seats declared and an expectation of half declared by the end of the week. Senate counts were two-thirds complete.\n    *   Return rates for active postal vote applications were high (approx. 2.37 million out of 2.7 million active PVAs).\n    *   Projected voter turnout for 2022 was noted to be trending 2-3% lower than 2019, consistent with international trends post-COVID-19.\n    *   The final vote count figures were presented, with writs for all 151 House of Representatives seats completed and expected to be returned to the Governor General by June 23, 2022.\n\nProvide only the markdown formatted summary text. Do not include any conversational filler or preamble."
