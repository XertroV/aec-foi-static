            "text": "These FOI documents, analyzed from a politically left-leaning perspective, reveal critical issues concerning electoral integrity, transparency, and the potential for government actions to align with or deviate from progressive values, particularly regarding social justice and civil liberties in the democratic process.\n\n**Electoral Integrity and Social Justice:**\n\n*   **\"Lost Votes\" and Voter Disenfranchisement:** The most glaring social justice concern arises from the 2013 WA Senate election recount. Grahame Bowland's independent analysis (Document 1) highlights that the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) \"lost 1370 votes\" which were not included in the recount. His simulations show that if these votes were re-added based on their initial interpretation, the outcome of a crucial exclusion would have swung back, electing different candidates (Louise Pratt (ALP) and Zhenya Wang (Palmer) over Scott Ludlam (Greens) and Wayne Dropulich (Sports Party)). This directly undermines the principle that every vote counts, raising serious questions about the fairness and accuracy of the democratic process and potentially disenfranchising voters. Such systemic failures to accurately count all votes represent a profound deviation from progressive values of equal participation and justice in elections.\n*   **Software Errors and Undefined Outcomes:** The report by Dr. Andrew Conway and A/Prof Vanessa Teague (Documents 3 & 4) identifies a fundamental error in the AEC's official Senate counting software, specifically in how it breaks ties for candidate exclusion. This deviation from the Commonwealth Electoral Act, while not yet definitively causing \"the wrong people to be elected\" according to the authors, introduces an element of arbitrary application to a crucial democratic process. Furthermore, the report details ambiguities in the Electoral Act itself regarding \"bulk exclusion\" and the termination conditions for the count. These ambiguities mean that different interpretations or applications of the rules can alter election outcomes (as demonstrated by examples where different candidates are elected or the order of election changes). Such imprecision in electoral law and its implementation deviates from progressive ideals of clear, consistent, and predictable rule of law, which are essential for public trust and a genuinely fair system.\n\n**Transparency, Corporate/Institutional Influence, and Civil Liberties:**\n\n*   **Closed-Source Software and Lack of Verifiability:** A central theme across the documents is the AEC's use of closed-source software for the complex Single Transferable Vote (STV) distribution (Document 1, Document 3). Bowland notes he was \"unable to find any publicly available software to run the count,\" forcing him to write his own to verify results. Teague and Conway explicitly state, \"We could easily make the necessary adjustments to the official code if it was similarly published online,\" and strongly advocate for the AEC to \"publish the official code\" (Recommendation 2). The lack of publicly available and auditable source code represents a significant barrier to transparency and public scrutiny, hindering civil liberties by making it difficult for citizens, academics, or political parties to independently verify election results. This creates an environment where institutional control over a critical democratic mechanism (the vote count) is opaque, raising concerns about potential, even if unintended, institutional influence or unchecked errors.\n*   **Call for Independent Audit:** Teague and Conway consistently recommend a \"rigorous statistical audit\" of digitized ballot data against the original paper ballots, conducted publicly in the presence of scrutineers (Recommendation 1). This vital recommendation, reiterated from previous submissions (Document 4, Section 1.1), points to a systemic lack of verifiability in the process of converting physical votes to digital data. Without such audits, the accuracy of the entire election chain remains unproven, undermining public confidence and deviating sharply from progressive demands for accountability and transparency in public processes.\n*   **Withholding Information:** The withholding of \"Research team notes on the Conway Teague paper\" (Document 5) due to \"Deliberative matter\" is a concern for transparency. While common under FOI, in the context of an election integrity report identifying errors and ambiguities, it can be perceived as limiting public insight into government responses and internal discussions about correcting flaws in the democratic process.\n\n**Legislative Ambiguity and Policy Inconsistencies:**\n\n*   **Bulk Exclusion:** The AEC's apparent practice of *not* implementing bulk exclusion (Document 3, Section 3), despite it being legislated, and the demonstration that this *can* alter election outcomes (due to rounding and order of elimination) reveals a significant policy inconsistency. While Teague and Conway recommend removing bulk exclusion from the Act for clarity (Recommendation 4), the current situation highlights a deviation where the AEC's operational choices, rather than the explicit law, dictate potential outcomes.\n*   **Termination of Count (Subsections 17 & 18):** The documents detail how ambiguities in the Act regarding when the count ends, specifically the application of sections 17 (last vacancy with two candidates) and 18 (unfilled seats equal continuing candidates), have led to inconsistent application by the AEC across different elections (2016 vs. 2019, Document 4, Sections 4.1 & 4.2). The fact that applying (17) at different stages can alter who wins (e.g., in the 2016 SA Senate special election, McEwen vs. Gichuhi) signifies a lack of a clear, legally defined electoral outcome. This procedural ambiguity and inconsistency deviate from the progressive ideal of a universally applied, fair, and transparent rule of law for all elections.\n*   **Tie-breaking Policy (Recommendation 3):** The recommendation to formalize the apparent policy of favoring candidates lower on the ballot in otherwise unresolved ties is a positive alignment with progressive values of fairness and equity, as it counters the \"donkey vote\" effect.\n\nIn conclusion, these FOI documents reveal a crucial tension between progressive values and the current state of electoral administration. While the AEC performs a complex task, the documented \"lost votes,\" software errors, and legislative ambiguities demonstrate significant deviations from principles of social justice, transparency, and civil liberties in the democratic process. The consistent calls for open-source code, rigorous audits, and legislative clarity represent vital steps towards a more accountable and genuinely verifiable electoral system, aligning with core left-leaning principles of a fair and just democracy."

He found no issue with the AEC results. It was a completely\nindependent activity, using the legislation as a source, and comparing to the distribution of\npreferences (I think that is what he is referring to).\n\nHis blog post on the matter is not available through the SOE, so I’ve replicated the text\nbelow. For reference, the software is still hosted on GitHub here:\nhttps://github.com/grahame/dividebatur\n\nCounting the West Australian Senate Election\n\nPosted on January 25, 2014 by Grahame Bowland\n\ntl;dr – check out angrygoats.net/wasenate/ to see the full details of the WA senate election distribution – precisely\nhow the count was processed by the AEC for both the initial count (#14votes) and the recount, and to see what\nhappens if the “lost” votes are added back in, assuming they were counted right the first time. grab the code and\nrun the distribution yourself, it’s over on github.\n\nWestern Australia went to the polls with the rest of the country on September 7 2013, but failed to clearly elect six\nsenators. When the votes were tallied a crucial exclusion on a margin of 14 votes was the difference between the\nelection of Scott Ludlam (Greens) and Wayne Dropulich (Sports Party), or Louise Pratt (ALP) and Zhenya Wang\n(Palmer). The ALP & Palmer won on this count, but no result was declared and a recount was conducted.\nAfter the initial count, several people asked me how the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) processed the\ndistribution of preferences, and whether there was a way to verify it. To my surprise the AEC software which takes\nall above-the-line and below-the-line votes and runs a Single Transferable Vote (STV) distribution is closed source\nand not available for download. I was unable to find any publicly available software to run the count. This made it\nextremely difficult to verify the correctness of AEC’s results.\nWhile the recount was going on I got to work on some software to process the distribution. This was greatly helped\nby a detailed run log from the AEC’s software I managed to obtain. This told me exactly how the AEC’s software ran\nthe distribution, including totals of votes for each candidate at each count, and precisely when candidates were\nelected and excluded.\nSTV is really a family of voting systems – some details vary between jurisdictions. The information I could find on\nthe AEC website on how to process the distribution was adequate only for educational purposes, and did not go into\nthe fine details. This lead to much late night study of the Commonwealth Electoral Act. A bill of Parliament is a\npretty awful means to document an algorithm, but everything needed is in Part XVIII.\nThe AEC publish all the data necessary to run a count on their Senate downloads page. It is simply a matter of\ntaking the number of above-the-line (ticket) votes and counting these votes as that number of papers following the\nparty’s ticket(s). They also publish the form of every below-the-line paper lodged. Add those papers into one\ncollection and you have all the information necessary to run the distribution, and determine who the elected\ncandidates are.\nIn two long nights of work, I was able to get this done – exactly reproducing the AEC’s results in my software. The\ncode was pretty rough and ready, but I had functional tests which checked my results matched the AEC’s. Being\nafraid of rounding errors I made sure to stick with rational number representations of transfer values, and was\nslightly hopeful this might turn up a minor error in the AEC’s software. Disappointingly, but reassuringly, I found no\nfault at all in the AEC’s software.\nThe AEC published above-the-line vote counts as the recount progressed. This made me hopeful I’d be able to run\na count myself once the recount was complete and know the result before the official distribution was run.\nUnfortunately they did not enter the changes to the below-the-line votes (ballots rescued from the informal pile) until\nthe last day, and did not make the data available until a couple of hours after they ran the count and declared the\nresult. Gratifyingly my software agreed with theirs, the election now tipping to Scott Ludlam and Wayne Dropulich,\nthe same crucial exclusion now going 12 votes the other way.\nOf course, the AEC lost 1370 votes which were not included in the recount. The preferences of those votes as\ninterpreted during the first count were published by the AEC, making it simple to add them back into the recount.\nThis swings the crucial exclusion back to a margin of 1 vote, electing Louise Pratt and Zhenya Wang. It’s impossible\nto know if these votes would have stood as they did if scrutinised again, and votes may also have come back from\n\n\n--- Page 2 ---\n\nlost informal votes.\nThe full senate vote distribution for these three scenarios can be viewed in detail. You can flick through the counts\none-by-one, or the summary page for each scenario will link you to the count in which any given candidate was\nelected or excluded.\nMy software outputs JSON data descr bing the distribution process, and the user interface is an\nangularjs application which presents that JSON data. If anyone is interested in analysis or visualisation of the full\ndistribution (as opposed to a simplified distribution only including above-the-line votes) the JSON files are linked for\ndownload. I would love to see some great animations appear from this data!\nIf you want to check out the code behind this, it’s over on github. I have named the project dividebatur (Latin for\n‘distribution’) and it is open source under the Apache license. If you’re interested in the STV algorithm itself, it’s\nimplemented in these 700 lines of Python code (hopefully quite readable).\nI learnt a bunch of surprising things implementing the distribution. A bundle of “x” papers distributed at a given\ntransfer value translates into a “x” times the transfer value votes, rounded down. This means that occasionally votes\nwill be “lost” to rounding. What I didn’t realise is that those votes can also come back – if those papers are\ndistributed in an exclusion, they may break by next preference in a way that avoids the rounding issue. Subtle\ndetails like this (and split group voting tickets, exclusion tie resolution, …) were tricky to get right!\nIn conclusion, we’ve now got some software which lets us as voters verify that the rather complex senate\ndistribution is correct, and study hypothetical scenarios if we want to. It is easy to determine what would happen if a\nparty changed their ticket vote in a particular way, or consider what would happen if a state-that-shall-not-be-named\nstuffed up their senate election. I hope you find it useful, and please send me feedback and/or patches!\n@angrygoat on twitter or grahame@angrygoats.net.\nDisclosure: I’m a member of The Greens (WA).

Ltd.\n& Australian National University\nvanessa.teague@anu.edu.au\n\nAugust 31, 2021\n\nAbstract\n\nThis report summarises our recommendations for technical changes to those parts of the\nElectoral Act that regulate the Senate Counting and Scrutiny. We show, and explain how\nto correct, a point on which the AEC’s current counting software does not correspond to the\nrequirements of the legislation. As far as we know, this has so far not caused the wrong\npeople to be elected. We also identify ambiguities in the legislation, which might leave the\nresult undeﬁned. These would be better resolved before the election when they are politically\nneutral.\n\nAlthough the digitization process is separate from the counting stage, our results bolster the\nargument for an independent audit of the paper ballots every Senate election, to demonstrate\nto scrutineers that the ballot-digitization process is accurate, or to allow for any errors to be\nidentiﬁed and corrected.\n\n1 Introduction\n\nThe Australian Senate count has several distinct phases:\n\n• ﬁrst preferences are manually counted,\n\n• paper ballots are imaged at a counting centre,\n\n• the images are digitized, using a combined human and automated process,\n\n• the digitized preferences are electronically counted, in order to establish who won a seat.\n\nThis report focuses on the last step. We ﬁnd an example in which the AEC’s oﬃcial counting\nsoftware deviates from the requirements of the Electoral Act, and two examples of changes of\ninterpretation. We then provide simple examples to demonstrate that these could, in principle,\nalter election results, though it does not seem to have done so yet. We then detail where either\nthe code needs to be corrected to conform to the Electoral Act, or where the Electoral Act could\nbe amended to match what we know of the code.\n\nThe error concerns the resolution of 3-way ties for the candidate with the lowest tally. We ﬁnd\nan example from the 2016 WA Senate election, in which the AEC’s software applied the wrong\ntiebreaking rule, resulting in candidates being excluded in the wrong order. This is described in\nSection 2.\n\nThe second issue is that the AEC has not implemented bulk exclusion (Section 13A). Contrary\nto common belief (and probably contrary to the intentions of the authors of the Electoral Act),\nbulk exclusion can alter who wins a seat. The Act is hard to interpret on whether bulk elimination\nis compulsory. This is detailed in Section 3, together with examples to show why bulk exclusion\ncan alter the election outcome. We recommend that bulk exclusion be deleted from the Electoral\nAct, matching the AEC’s current practice.\n\n∗Andrew Conway is a member of the Secular Party.\n†Vanessa Teague is an advisory board member of Veriﬁed Voting, a non-governmental US organization working\n\ntoward accuracy, integrity and veriﬁability of elections.\n\n1\n\n\n--- Page 2 ---\n\nAs a third issue, the Electoral Act does not clearly deﬁne when the count ends, which is relevant\nbecause two termination conditions may apply simultaneously. This can leave ambiguity over who\nwins the last seat (under subsection (17)) and can alter the order in which candidates are considered\nto have been elected (under subsection 18). Suggested amendments are described in Section 4.\n\n1.1 Prior work\n\nThese results are similar to our prior discoveries of errors in the NSW [CBNT17] and ACT [CT]\nvote counts. The tiebreaking problems are similar to those identiﬁed by Wen [Wen10]. Most of\nour suggestions for simpliﬁcations are aligned with Gor´e and Lebedeva [GL16], whose suggestions\nfor further improvements we also support.\n\nOther open-source STV counting programs include Grahame Bowland’s Dividebatur1 and its\nsuccessor Dividebatur22, Lee Yingtong Li’s OpenTally3, and Milad Ghale’s formally veriﬁed STV4.\nDividebatur2 is speciﬁcally implemented for the exact Senate rules, and performs tiebreaking\ncorrectly, but does not implement bulk exclusion.\n\nWe have written extensively in the past about the importance of auditing the digitization\nprocess [BCT+19]. Although it is not directly relevant to this report, the importance of double-\nchecking electronic processes is emphasised, so we reiterate that recommendation here:\n\nRecommendation 1. When the preference data ﬁles for Senate votes are published, there should\nbe a rigorous statistical audit to check that they accurately reﬂect the paper ballots. This should be\nconducted in a way that allows Scrutineers to check both the algorithms and the data.\n\nThe rest of this report details speciﬁc issues in the count.\n\n1.2 Summary and purpose of this report\n\nWe have identiﬁed one case in which the AEC’s software is diﬀerent from the legislated rules, one\nin which it could be debated, and one in which the Electoral Act is ambiguous. These all need to\nbe clariﬁed before they make a diﬀerence to an election outcome.\n\nThe Senate count, like other Single Transferable Vote legislation, is highly complex and de-\npendent on a number of rather arbitrary choices. The ambiguity is the problem—almost any\nclariﬁcation deﬁned in advance would suﬃce, as long as it was unambiguous and exactly followed\nby the AEC. For example, if the AEC agreed to publish its source code, the legislation could be\namended to reﬂect it. (Although we would not generally recommend making legislation in this\nway, it would be harmless for the examples in this report.)\n\nEach section of this report includes speciﬁc recommendations for resolving the diﬀerences or\n\nclarifying the rules.\n\nOur aim in this report is to contribute to improving electoral legislation and process to achieve\nelection results that are unambiguous and publicly veriﬁable. Everyone makes mistakes, and there\nis no reason that occasional errors should undermine public trust in the election, if there is a good\nprocess for checking and correcting the count. Improving processes to produce clear evidence of\nan accurate election outcome is of great beneﬁt for public trust in Australian election outcomes.\n\nWe encourage everyone to examine and double-check our results. Our code and examples are\n\navailable at https://github.com/AndrewConway/ConcreteSTV\n\n2 Three way ties: error in the WA 2016 Senate count\n\nWhen the lowest standing candidate is to be excluded, and there is a tie, there is an explicit rule\nfor resolving it:\n\nElectoral Act, Section 273 31(b)\n\n...if 2 or more continuing candidates have the same number of votes, those candidates\nshall stand in the poll in the order of the relative number of votes of each of those\ncandidates at the last count at which each of them had a diﬀerent number of votes,\n[our emphasis] with the continuing candidate with the greater or greatest number of\nvotes at that count standing higher in the poll and the continuing candidate with the\nfewer or fewest number of votes at that count standing lower in the poll, but if there\n\n1https://github.com/grahame/dividebatur\n2https://github.com/grahame/dividebatur2\n3https://yingtongli.me/git/OpenTally/\n4https://github.com/MiladKetabGhale/STV-Counting-ProtocolVerification\n\n2\n\n\n--- Page 3 ---\n\nCount HERCOCK, Marion FARGHER, Sara HENG, Henry\n57\n63\n63\n63\n65\n65\n65\n66\n66\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5..9\n10,11\n12..15\n16..41\n42..48\n\n61\n64\n65\n65\n65\n65\n65\n65\n66\n\n54\n57\n60\n61\n63\n64\n65\n66\n66\n\nTable 1: Tiebreaking in the ﬁrst 2016 WA Senate special election. Hercock was excluded, though\nFargher had the lowest tally when each of the three candidates’ tallies were diﬀerent (Count 4).\n\nhas been no such count the Australian Electoral Oﬃcer for the State shall determine\nthe order of standing of those candidates in the poll.\n\nThere are very similar clauses in subsections (22) and (22b) for order of election and surplus\n\ndistribution tie resolution.\n\nIn the ﬁrst WA 2016 Senate special count,5 (conducted on 7 March 2017, after Rod Cullerton\nwas removed), this situation arose at Count 48, where there was a three-way tie for exclusion:\nM. Hercock, S. Fargher and H Heng all had 66 votes. Their tallies are shown in Table 1. The\nlast count at which each of them had a diﬀerent number of votes was Count 4, with 65, 61 and\n63 respectively. Our reading of the legislation is that S. Fargher should therefore be excluded at\nCount 48.\n\nIn the oﬃcial count, the AEC excluded M. Hercock instead. There is a natural argument for\nthis—at count 41 M. Hercock had a lower tally than either of the others, and there is no reason\nother than the legislation that this would not be a reasonable basis for tie resolution. Indeed, this\napproach has the advantage of resolving more situations than the “each of them had a diﬀerent\nnumber” rule. It would be a reasonable thing to legislate, but it is not what the Electoral Act\ncurrently requires.\n\nOf course, diﬀerent methods of resolving who is excluded can easily change the outcome of the\nelection. As a very simple example of how this could aﬀect who is elected, imagine that the number\nof vacancies was equal to the number of candidates remaining after the candidate in question was\nexcluded. For this reason it is essential that the legislation and the oﬃcial code be aligned.\n\nRecommendation 2. Either:\n\n• Correct the AEC’s oﬃcial code to follow the legislation for tie resolution, or\n\n• Ask the AEC to publish the oﬃcial code, including its tiebreaking rules, and amend the\n\nlegislation to match it.\n\nIt is also worth pointing out that sometimes the prior counts do not resolve the tie, and the\nAustralian Electoral Oﬃcer is called upon to choose an order. In 2016 and 2019, it appears that all\nsuch decisions favoured candidates according to their position on the ballot, with lower candidates\nbetter favoured. This seems fair as the donkey vote otherwise favours higher candidates. This\nseems like an excellent policy which we fully endorse, and would suggest making part of the act.\n\nRecommendation 3. Formalize as legislation the apparent policy to, in the case of otherwise\nunresolved ties, favour candidates lower on the ballot.\n\n3 Bulk Exclusions: omission in the 2016 and 2019 counts\n\nSection 273 subsection (13A) describes a bulk exclusion where multiple candidates are excluded\ntogether. It is commonly believed (and probably intended) that this can never alter the election\noutcome. In this section we show that that assumption is mistaken.\n\nThe AEC does not appear to have implemented bulk exclusions since 2013, presumably in the\nmistaken belief that it cannot not alter the count. It is unclear whether bulk exclusion is at the\nAEC’s discretion or not. The Electoral Act Section 273 (13) states:\n\n5The oﬃcial Distribution of Preferences is at https://www.aec.gov.au/Elections/federal_elections/2016/\n\nfiles/wa-senate-dist-prefs-2016fe-special-count-07032017.pdf\n\n3\n\n\n--- Page 4 ---\n\n(13) Where, after the counting of ﬁrst preference votes or the transfer of surplus votes\n(if any) of elected candidates, no candidate has, or fewer than the number of candidates\nrequired to be elected have, received a number of votes equal to the quota:\n\n(a) the candidate who stands lowest in the poll must be excluded; or\n\n(b) if a bulk exclusion of candidates may be eﬀected under subsection (13A), those\n\ncandidates must be excluded;\n\nThe logic seems unclear here—we are not lawyers and cannot say with conﬁdence whether “those\ncandidates must be excluded” would apply whenever (13A) permits it, but that would be one\nplausible interpretation.\n\nIn this section we provide two simple examples to show that, in two diﬀerent ways, bulk\nexclusion can alter the outcome. The ﬁrst concerns the order of eliminations, the second is due to\nrounding. In each case, diﬀerent people are elected depending on whether the bulk exclusion rule\nis applied.\n\n3.1 Bulk Exclusions and order of elimination\n\nSubsection 13A (d) (i) does not have a clause requiring candidate C to satisfy a similar condition\nto 13A (b) (ii). This means that bulk exclusions can change the order of elimination. This can\nreadily change the outcome of an election. A simple example is shown here with 6 vacancies, and\nvotes as described in the table below:\n\nPreference List Occurrences\nL1, L2, W1, W3\nL2\nL3, L2, W1, W3\nL4, W1, W2\nL5, W4\nL5, W5\nL5, W6\nL5, W7\nL5\nW7\nW6\nW5\nW4\nW3\nW2\nW2, W4\nW2, W5\nW2, W6\nW1\n\n2\n3\n4\n6\n1\n2\n3\n4\n10\n400\n400\n400\n400\n400\n388\n6\n4\n2\n400\n\nUsing the rules as applied by the AEC in 2013, as best we can reverse engineer, would result\n\nin the distribution of preferences shown in table 2, with bulk exclusion occurring on count 1:\n\nHowever, using the rules that seem to have been applied by the AEC in 2016, ignoring bulk ex-\nclusions, the order of elimination changes, and candidate W3 is elected instead of W2. Furthermore\nthe order of election of candidates W4, W5, W6 and W7 is reversed, as shown in table 3\n\nCuriously enough, using the rules apparently applied by the AEC in 2019, the same candidates\n\nare elected, but in a diﬀerent order; see section 4.2.\n\n3.2 Bulk Exclusions and rounding\n\nIt is more obvious that Bulk Exclusions can change rounding, and this can change the result of\nthe election. Rounding may seem like a small eﬀect, but in 2016 Tasmania, there were 285 votes\nlost due to rounding, and the margin between the last two candidates was 143 votes.\n\nHere is a very simple demonstration of how the presence or absence of bulk exclusion can change\n\nrounding and thus who is elected in a 2 vacancy election.\n\n4\n\n\n--- Page 5 ---\n\nCount W1 W2 W3 W4 W5 W6 W7\n400\n400\n\n400\n\n400\n\n400\n\n400\n\nExclude L1, L2\n\n400\n\n400\n\n400\n\n400\n\n400\n\n400\n\n1\n400\n2 +2\n402\n3 +4\n406\n\nExclude L3\n4\nExclude L4\n5\nExclude L5\n6\nExclude W3\n\n400\n+6\n406\n\n400\n\n406 (cid:8)(cid:8)(cid:72)(cid:72)400\n−400\n0\n\n406\n\n406\n\n406\n\n406\n\n400\n\n400\n\n400\n\n400\n\n400\n\n400\n\n400\n\n400\n400\n+1 +2 +3 +4\n404\n401\n\n403\n\n402\n\n401\n\n402\n\n403\n\n404\n\nL1\n(cid:1)(cid:65)2\n\nL2\n(cid:1)(cid:65)3\n−2 −3\n0\n\n0\n\nL3\n4\n\n(cid:1)(cid:65)4\n−4\n0\n\nL5\n20\n\n20\n\n20\n\nL4\n6\n\n6\n\n(cid:1)(cid:65)6\n−6\n\n0 (cid:26)(cid:26)(cid:90)(cid:90)20\n−20\n0\n\nExh.

The ambiguity over\nwhether or not to use it could result in a contested election outcome that is diﬃcult or impossible\nto resolve. The best way to avoid this is to remove bulk exclusion from the Act.\n\nRecommendation 4. Remove Bulk Exclusion from the Act. This includes subsections (13A),\n(13B), (13C), portions of (13AA), and several deﬁnitions in (29).\n\n6\n\n\n--- Page 7 ---\n\n4 Ambiguity in the Act: termination of the count\n\nThere are three diﬀerent ways a candidate can be elected:\n\n• by attaining a quota,\n\n• by being the higher of the two continuing candidates when there is exactly one unﬁlled seat\n\n(Subsection (17)).\n\n• by being a continuing candidate when the number of unﬁlled seats equals the number of\n\ncontinuing candidates, (subsection (18))\n\nThe Act does not explicitly deﬁne when the distribution of preferences ends—in particular, it\nis unclear when subsections (17) or (18) apply. Subsection (18) aﬀects only order, not who gets\nelected. However, subsection (17) can aﬀect who wins.\n\nCommonwealth Electoral Act 1918, Section 273, (17)\n\nIn respect of the last vacancy for which two continuing candidates remain, the con-\ntinuing candidate who has the larger number of votes shall be elected notwithstanding\nthat that number is below the quota, and if those candidates have an equal number of\nvotes the Australian Electoral Oﬃcer for the State shall have a casting vote but shall\nnot otherwise vote at the election.\n\nUnlike a computer program, which (usually) has an implicit but well-deﬁned sequence of exe-\ncution steps, the Electoral Act simply lists a number of things that could happen (in subsections\n(9) through (18)) but does not specify which should be chosen when the conditions for two or more\nhave been met.\n\nAs a speciﬁc example, suppose one candidate (A) attains a quota (and hence a seat), leaving\ntwo other candidates, B and C, competing for a single last seat. Should subsection (17) apply\nimmediately, electing whichever of B and C has a larger total, or should A’s surplus be distributed\nﬁrst? The legislation is not clear.\n\nSubsection (14) states\n\n(14) Any continuing candidate who has received a number of votes equal to or\ngreater than the quota on the completion of a transfer under subsection (13) or (15)\nof ballot papers of an excluded candidate or candidates, as the case may be, shall be\nelected, and, unless all the vacancies have been ﬁlled, the surplus votes (if any) of the\ncandidate so elected shall be transferred...\n\nThe question is whether, “all the vacancies have been ﬁlled,” because (17) applies immediately,\nor instead (17) should not be applied until after this transfer has been completed. A similar\nambiguity arises over exclusions (subsection (15)): when a candidate is excluded, should subsection\n(17) apply immediately, or should the excluded candidate’s preferences be distributed ﬁrst?\n\nThese decisions could aﬀect who wins, because preference distribution could alter the relative\n\nrankings of the two continuing candidates.\n\n4.1 Practical examples of when subsection (17) can alter the election\n\noutcome\n\nIn practice, for all the examples we could ﬁnd, the AEC seems to apply (17) only after all transfers\nhave been completed. This seems like the right thing to do, and we believe the legislation should\nbe amended to reﬂect (what seems to be) the AEC’s practice. Indeed, subsection (17) could simply\nbe removed—it is unnecessary because the exclusion of the lower candidate immediately causes\nsubsection (18) to apply (one candidate and one seat remaining).\n\nResolving the ambiguity is important because this case arises frequently in practice. For exam-\nple, consider the special count of the 2016 South Australian Senate votes, conducted in 2017 after\nthe removal of Bob Day.6 The last steps are summarised in Table 6. At the end of Count 453, there\nare three remaining candidates: McEwen (ALP), Gichuhi (FFP), and Burgess (ON). Burgess has\nthe least votes and is excluded, leaving only two candidates. If subsection (17) were applied imme-\ndiately, McEwen would win (with the higher tally). But after all the preferences are distributed,\nGichuhi wins. Similar examples arose in 2013 in NSW, Vic, WA and Tasmania.\n\n6https://www.aec.gov.au/Elections/Federal_Elections/2016/files/sa-senate-dist-prefs-2016fe-special-count-13042017.\n\npdf\n\n7\n\n\n--- Page 8 ---\n\nCount McEWEN GICHUHI BURGESS\n\n453\nSurplus KAKOSCHKE-MOORE\n454–465\nExclude BURGESS\n\n54099\n\n52482\n\n(cid:24)(cid:24)(cid:24)(cid:88)(cid:88)(cid:88)46684\n\n65841\n\n69442\n\n0\n\nTable 6: The last steps of the 2016 South Australian Senate special election count, conducted in\n2017.

Elected candidates are\ncolored purple once they have a quota.\n\nRecommendation 5. Remove subsection (17), or clarify that it applies only after all papers from\nsurplus distributions and exclusions are transferred (which seems to be the AEC’s current practice).\n\n4.2 Subsection 18\n\nSubsection (18) does not aﬀect who wins, but may aﬀect their order—we do not know whether\nthis matters in any politically-relevant way.\n\nIn 2016, the AEC seemed to apply section 18 after ﬁnishing started exclusions and any surplus\ndistributions that may thereby arise. For example, in the Queensland 2016 election, at count 830,\ncandidate R. McGarvie was excluded, leaving 2 candidates and 2 seats. The exclusion was carried\nout in full (11 counts), and C Ketter was discovered to have a quota, leaving 1 candidate (M\nRoberts) and 1 vacancy. This candidate was not elected until count 841, when C Ketter’s surplus\nwas distributed. Similar events happened in Victoria (count 814), and NSW (count 1054). A\ndiﬀerent thing occurred in WA 2016 (with R. Cullerton excluded) where on count 535 K. Muir was\nexcluded, leaving 2 candidates and 2 seats. The ﬁrst step of the exclusion was performed, at the\nend of which the remaining 2 candidates were both declared elected. Regardless, the transfer of\nvotes for the ﬁrst step of exclusion was always performed.\n\nIn 2019 the rules seemed to change and the AEC applied subsection (18) immediately after\nidentiﬁcation of a candidate to be excluded, before transferring any votes. In 2019 NSW, count\n429, K. McCulloch is excluded. This leaves 2 candidates, 2 vacancies. The preference distribution\nwas aborted and no ballots were transferred in this count.\n\nRecommendation 6. Clarify when subsection (18) applies.\n\nThe example used in Section 3.1 can be applied using the rules the AEC appeared to have used\nin 2019, aborting an exclusion after identiﬁcation of the candidate to be excluded. This produces\nyet another diﬀerent outcome from the same votes shown in table 7. This time only the order of\nelection changes, with the order of election of candidates W4, W5, W6 and W7 being reversed.\n\n8\n\n\n--- Page 9 ---\n\n5 Conclusion\n\nEveryone makes mistakes, and all software has bugs and security vulnerabilities.7 For election\nsoftware, the crucial thing is not to make the software perfect (which is impossible) but to ensure\nan open and transparent process that allows the software, and its results, to be scrutinised and\ndouble-checked. It is a good thing when errors and vulnerabilities are found and ﬁxed.\n\nWe have found one error (in the implementation of tiebreaking) in the AEC’s oﬃcial Senate\ncounting software. This needs to be corrected before the next election, and we would be happy to\nhelp patch it if the source code is made openly available. Alternatively, the Electoral Act could be\namended to match the AEC’s current algorithm—it does not really matter how ties are broken,\nas long as the algorithm is speciﬁed in advance. Modifying the Electoral Act to match the current\nalgorithm would also be aided by opening the source code.\n\nThe same applies to the other two ambiguities we identiﬁed in the Electoral Act: bulk exclusion\nand the order of application of subsection (17). The legislation is unclear, and needs to be clariﬁed,\neither to match the AEC’s current code (if it is made available) or independently. A system that\nallows discretion over ambiguous rules, or runs a count diﬀerent from the speciﬁed rules, may result\nin disputes at election time that are diﬃcult or impossible to resolve.\n\nThe purpose of this report is to avoid this outcome, by providing speciﬁc directions on correcting\nthe AEC’s code (Section 2), realigning the AEC’s code with the unclear legislation (Section 3),\nand resolving ambiguitites in the legislation (Section 4). This should give very high conﬁdence\nthat the counting software is accurate and produces the unique outcome deﬁned by legislation.\n\nIt is easy to double-check the Senate counting software, because the software’s inputs (votes)\nand outputs (distributions of preferences) are both publicly available. This allows for the open\npublic double-checking that is critical to democracy. (Of course it does not guarantee that all such\nproblems will be found before they aﬀect a count.) It is very helpful that the AEC makes this\ninformation publicly available.\n\nBy contrast, it is not possible to double-check—so as to ﬁnd and ﬁx errors in—the software that\nconverts paper ballots to digitized preferences. This leaves the AEC without a way of providing\nevidence of an accurate election outcome. A statistical audit of randomly-chosen paper ballots,\nin the presence of scrutineers, would allow the digitized preferences to be double-checked against\ntheir paper originals. This would give onlookers a chance to ﬁnd and ﬁx problems, or to see that\nthere was good evidence that the number of discrepancies was small.\n\n6 Summary of Recommendations\n\nRecommendation 1. When the preference data ﬁles for Senate votes are published, there should\nbe a rigorous statistical audit to check that they accurately reﬂect the paper ballots. This should be\nconducted in a way that allows Scrutineers to check both the algorithms and the data.\n\nRecommendation 2. Either:\n\n• Correct the AEC’s oﬃcial code to follow the legislation for tie resolution, or\n\n• Ask the AEC to publish the oﬃcial code, including its tiebreaking rules, and amend the\n\nlegislation to match it.\n\nRecommendation 3. Formalize as legislation the apparent policy to, in the case of otherwise\nunresolved ties, favour candidates lower on the ballot.\n\nRecommendation 4. Remove Bulk Exclusion from the Act. This includes subsections (13A),\n(13B), (13C), portions of (13AA), and several deﬁnitions in (29).\n\nRecommendation 5. Remove subsection (17), or clarify that it applies only after all papers from\nsurplus distributions and exclusions are transferred (which seems to be the AEC’s current practice).\n\nRecommendation 6. Clarify when subsection (18) applies.\n\n7Even our software. We found the AEC tiebreaking error when we were re-implementing our version of the\n\nSenate count and noticed we had made the same mistake.\n\n9\n\n\n--- Page 10 ---\n\nReferences\n\n[BCT+19] Michelle Blom, Chris Culnane, Vanessa Teague, Damjan Vukcevic, Andrew Conway,\nRajeev Gor´e, and Peter Stuckey.

We would be\nhappy to help the AEC implement these measures securely and transparently.\n\nYours Sincerely,\n\nVanessa Teague and Andrew Conway.\n\nVanessa Teague\n\n\n--- Page 2 ---\n\nCEO, Thinking Cybersecurity Pty.
