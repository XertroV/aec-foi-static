Through intrusive security clearances and restrictive social media policies, the program flagrantly violates personal privacy, self-ownership, and free speech, demanding ideological conformity and intellectual silence rather than respecting autonomous thought. It actively suppresses rational self-interest and productive ambition by prioritizing bureaucratic compliance over exceptional output, denying study support or opportunities for higher duties, and dictating an arbitrary pace of career progression. This collectivist framework, rooted in a top-down government hierarchy, subordinates the individual's moral autonomy and potential for value creation to collective \"values\" and administrative tasks, stifling innovation and merit-based advancement. In essence, the AEC program treats individuals as mere means to serve a bureaucratic apparatus, rather than as ends in themselves, thereby demonstrating the perilous impact of government overreach on personal freedom and the pursuit of one's rational self-interest and highest productive capacity.\n [REQUEST OVERVIEW END] \n\n--- MAIN DOCUMENT TEXT START ---\n\n\n\n--- Page 1 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 2 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 3 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 4 ---\n\n\n\nProvide only the markdown formatted summary text.
