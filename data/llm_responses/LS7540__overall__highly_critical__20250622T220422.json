            "text": "The Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) stands exposed by these FOI documents as an institution plagued by bureaucratic incompetence, lacking transparency, and exhibiting a deeply concerning pattern of reactive, last-minute decision-making that undermines the integrity of the electoral process.\n\n**Damning Timeline of Systemic Failure:**\n\nDespite the Australian Democrats submitting a partial application on November 30, 2018 (Doc 40) and the \"full\" application on December 1, 2018 (Doc 42), the AEC's \"official\" acknowledgement (Doc 48) wasn't until December 3, and the approval letter (Doc 36) *falsely* lists the application date as December 5. This initial obfuscation of the application start date is indicative of the AEC immediately setting the stage for delays.\n\nInstead of swift action, the AEC dragged its feet for nearly three months before publicly announcing the application. The \"Notice of Application\" (Doc 5) inviting public objections was only issued around February 26, 2019 – a egregious delay given the party's keen awareness of impending election timelines (Doc 105). This protracted waiting period alone caused \"significant risk\" and \"deep concern\" to the Australian Democrats, who had already invested \"significant sums of money\" into election preparations (Doc 105).\n\n**Incompetence and Red Tape as Obstacles:**\n\nThe application process was marred by basic, yet persistent, failures:\n\n*   **Missing Information & Delayed Checks:** The AEC somehow took nearly two months (from early December to January 25, 2019 - Doc 55) to identify that the party's street address, a fundamental piece of information, was missing from the application form. This highlights a glaring initial oversight and a shocking lack of diligence in reviewing critical documents.\n*   **Repeated Technical Fiascos:** The Australian Democrats' attempts to submit a compliant logo were met with repeated rejections due to technical failures (Doc 50, 58). It took *three attempts* (Dec 21, 2018; Feb 5, 2019; Feb 6, 2019 - Docs 50, 57, 58, 59) over six weeks for the party to provide a technically valid logo, exposing either profound incompetence within the party or a labyrinthine and poorly communicated set of technical requirements from the AEC. This bureaucratic quagmire wasted precious time and resources.\n\n**Questionable Membership Integrity and Opaque Scrutiny:**\n\nThe membership validation process, crucial for party legitimacy, raises red flags:\n\n*   **Fluid Membership and Apparent Leniency:** The initial membership count of 550 (Doc 49) was almost immediately compromised by \"cross-party duplicates\" and the party's request to remove 3 members who had \"resigned since Christmas\" (Doc 51). The AEC allowing this \"deletion\" *before* formal testing commenced (Doc 52, 53) can be interpreted as undue leniency, allowing the party to \"cleanse\" its list and avoid a more rigorous assessment of their initial submission's integrity.\n*   **Concealed Data:** Most damningly, the \"Breakdown of Australian Democrats membership testing conducted\" (Doc 74) was *initially withheld* from this FOI release and only disclosed after an \"internal review\" (LS7843, December 12, 2019). This deliberate suppression of key eligibility data points to an active attempt by the AEC to conceal details of its scrutiny, raising serious questions about transparency and accountability. The numerous gaps in the document numbering (e.g., 9-10, 13-14, 17, 20, 22-35, 37, 39, 43, 47, 60, 67-72, 76-84, 89, 91, 94-95, 103) further fuels suspicion of selective disclosure.\n\n**Reactive Governance and Avoided Accountability:**\n\nThe most egregious failure lies in the AEC's eleventh-hour approval:\n\n*   **Pressure-Driven Approval:** On April 7, 2019, the Australian Democrats issued a desperate plea, condemning the AEC's \"extended delay\" and \"significant risk\" to their ability to contest the election (Doc 105). Astonishingly, the AEC's approval (Doc 36) was issued *on the very same day*. This is not a coincidence; it is a clear indication that the AEC only acted decisively when faced with a direct, formal complaint detailing their own failures and the looming deadline for election writs.\n*   **Suspicious Retraction:** The Democrats' National Secretary then, almost immediately, emailed the AEC on April 8, 2019, requesting that their urgent complaint be \"disregarded and deleted\" (Doc 106). This swift retraction, followed by a sudden outpouring of thanks (Doc 110), strongly suggests that the party was either pressured or felt compelled to withdraw their criticism after the last-minute approval. This paints a damning picture of an AEC that prioritizes avoiding formal grievances over maintaining consistent, timely, and transparent processes. The agency pushed the party to the brink, then quickly resolved the issue once a formal complaint was lodged, effectively dodging accountability.\n\nIn conclusion, these documents reveal an AEC that is slow, inefficient, prone to basic errors, and seemingly willing to obscure its processes. Its reactive approach, driven by external pressure rather than internal competence, directly jeopardized a political party's ability to participate in an election, inflicting financial and operational damage. The selective release of information further entrenches the perception of an agency that struggles with fundamental transparency, fostering an environment where bureaucratic inertia and questionable practices are allowed to flourish."

Engagement \nAustralian Electoral Commission \nBY EMAIL ONLY TO:  fad@aec.gov.au \n\nDear Assistant Commissioner \n\nAPPLICATION FOR REGISTRATION OF THE AUSTRALIAN DEMOCRATS AS A POLITICAL \nPARTY \n\nThe Australian Democrats lodged an application for registration as a political party on the 3rd\nDecember 2018. At that time, we anticipated a May election and believed we had ample time for the\nregistration to be completed based on the timeframes published by the AEC in the Party Registration\nGuide. \n\nWe are concerned that the published timeframes suggested that the notification period was likely at\nabout six weeks into the registration timeline.\nThe notification period in this instance did not\ncommence until the 26​th of February which was closer to ten weeks into the registration process.\nThis initial delay immediately put our registration at significant risk. \n\nWhile we understand there are a large number of public holidays during the Christmas and New Year\nperiod, but this does not explain the extended delay from the indicated timeline.  \n\nSpecifically, the Guide indicates a minimum three-month timeframe if no objections are received.\nThis period would include a one-month mandatory notification period and a subsequent two-week\nperiod to conclude the process, presumably once the objections are resolved by the Delegate. \n\nThere was a vexatious objection lodged on or around the last day of the notification period. We\nresponded to the AEC within twenty-four hours.\nIt is clear the objection does not address or pertain\nto the specific criteria on which an objection to registration can be lodged as published by the AEC. \n\nWe have worked on the assumption that our application was lodged with enough time to reasonably\nexpect it to be completed in time for the party to registered. We have candidates standing by who\nhave already spent significant sums of money to be prepared to run in the election and we are now\ndeeply concerned about the likelihood of registration. \n\nLS7540 Released Document No. 105Freedom of Information Release\n\n\n--- Page 2 ---\n\nWe have acted in good faith and we believe that we have worked with reasonable expectations in\nrelation to the registration process. We believe that the AEC also has a duty of care in relation to\nreasonable timeframes.   \n\nWe understand that the AEC will cease work on registration applications once the Writs are issued\nand that if our application has not been processed and approved by that date, we will not be able to\nparticipate in the election. Based on the election timelines published by the AEC the latest date the\nWrits can be issued by the AEC would be the 8​th of April for an 11​th May election or the 15​th of April\nfor an 18​th​ May election. \n\nWe need to know now if the AEC sees any scope for the Australian Democrats to be registered in\ntime to contest the 2019 federal election. If it is still possible to be registered, we implore the AEC to\ncommit to finalising the process. \n\nI look forward to your prompt advice in regards our prospects to participate in this election. \n\nSincerely \n\nElisa Resce \nNational President \nAustralian Democrats \n\n4LS7540 Released Document No. 105Freedom of Information Release\n\n\n--- Page 3 ---\n\nREDACTION CODES \n\nPersonal Information (name) redacted. \n\nPersonal Information (date of birth) redacted. \n\nPersonal Information (photograph) redacted \n\nPersonal Information (facsimile of signature) redacted. \n\nPersonal Information (facsimile of manuscript initialling) redacted. \n\nPersonal Information (individual’s address) redacted. \n\nPersonal Information (individual’s telephone number) redacted. \n\nPersonal Information (individual’s opinion) redacted. \n\nPersonal Information (opinion about individual) redacted. \n\nPersonal Information (employment history) redacted. \n\nPersonal Information (qualifications) redacted. \n\nPersonal Information (health) redacted. \n\nPersonal Information (identifying individual) redacted. \n\nBusiness information (Bank Account details) redacted. \n\nBusiness information (Billing Account details) redacted. \n\nBusiness information (internal operations) redacted. \n\nLegal Professional Communication redacted. \n\nDeliberative material redacted. \n\nIrrelevant material redacted. \n\nElectoral Roll material redacted. \n\nTests, examinations or audits material redacted. \n\nManagement or assessment of personnel material redacted. \n\nProper and efficient conduct of the operations of AEC material redacted. \n\nLawful methods or procedures for preventing, detecting, investigating, or \ndealing with matters arising out of, breaches or evasions of the law. \n\n1 \n\n2 \n\n3 \n\n4 \n\n5 \n\n6 \n\n7 \n\n8 \n\n9 \n\n10 \n\n11 \n\n12 \n\n13 \n\n14 \n\n15 \n\n16 \n\n17 \n\n18 \n\n19 \n\n20 \n\n21 \n\n22 \n\n23 \n\n24 \n\nLS7540 Released Document No. 105Freedom of Information Release\n\n\n\n--- Page 1 ---\n\nAbe Williamson\n\nFrom:\nSent:\nTo:\nSubject:\n\nandrew.castrique@australian-democrats.org.au\nMonday, 8 April 2019 2:52 AM\nFAD\nPlease disregard email of Sunday 7th April\n\nCategories:\n\nParty Reg Inquiry - Complete, FAD Correspondence\n\nDear Sir, Madam, \nRegarding the email and attached letter sent to the Assistant Commissioner, sent on the 7th April, sent by Elisa \nResce, National President, Australian Democrats. \nPlease disregard and delete said email and letter. \nThank you. \nAndrew Castrique \nNational Secretary \nAustralian Democrats \n\nE: andrew.castrique@australian-democrats.org.au \nP: \n\n1\n\nLS7540 Released Document No. 1067Freedom of Information Release\n\n\n--- Page 2 ---\n\nREDACTION CODES \n\nPersonal Information (name) redacted. \n\nPersonal Information (date of birth) redacted. \n\nPersonal Information (photograph) redacted \n\nPersonal Information (facsimile of signature) redacted. \n\nPersonal Information (facsimile of manuscript initialling) redacted. \n\nPersonal Information (individual’s address) redacted. \n\nPersonal Information (individual’s telephone number) redacted. \n\nPersonal Information (individual’s opinion) redacted. \n\nPersonal Information (opinion about individual) redacted. \n\nPersonal Information (employment history) redacted. \n\nPersonal Information (qualifications) redacted. \n\nPersonal Information (health) redacted. \n\nPersonal Information (identifying individual) redacted. \n\nBusiness information (Bank Account details) redacted. \n\nBusiness information (Billing Account details) redacted. \n\nBusiness information (internal operations) redacted. \n\nLegal Professional Communication redacted. \n\nDeliberative material redacted. \n\nIrrelevant material redacted. \n\nElectoral Roll material redacted. \n\nTests, examinations or audits material redacted. \n\nManagement or assessment of personnel material redacted. \n\nProper and efficient conduct of the operations of AEC material redacted. \n\nLawful methods or procedures for preventing, detecting, investigating, or \ndealing with matters arising out of, breaches or evasions of the law. \n\n1 \n\n2 \n\n3 \n\n4 \n\n5 \n\n6 \n\n7 \n\n8 \n\n9 \n\n10 \n\n11 \n\n12 \n\n13 \n\n14 \n\n15 \n\n16 \n\n17 \n\n18 \n\n19 \n\n20 \n\n21 \n\n22 \n\n23 \n\n24 \n\nFreedom of Information Release\n\n\n\n--- Page 1 ---\n\nAbe Williamson\n\nFrom:\nSent:\nTo:\nCc:\nSubject:\nAttachments:\n\nDear Mr Churchill  \n\nFAD\nMonday, 8 April 2019 4:51 PM\n'ro@australian-democrats.org.au'\nFAD\nApplication for registration - Australian Democrats [SEC=UNCLASSIFIED]\ncorrespondenceDC.pdf;

political party (within the meaning of subsection  129(2)) that\nthe matter is likely to be confused with or mistaken for that name or that\nabbreviation or  acronym,  as the case may be.\n\nLogo Validation \nThe logo has been assessed against the specifications described in Commonwealth Electoral \n(Logo Requirements) Determination 2016 and has met the requirements (the validation  email is at \nfolio  76). \n\nBackground Check \nThe Party's logo has been checked by Cre8ive and the AEC has been advised there are no issues \nwith the Party's logo and there were no similar logos found (folio 92). \n\nIn summary, the proposed logo is not prohibited under s 129A of the Electoral Act. \n\nC \n\nAssessment of membership list \nThe membership list  submitted by  the Party  contained 550 members. This list was checked \nautomatically using RMANS,  with 513 members identified on the electoral roll.  A further 35 \nmembers were manually identified on the electoral roll using GENESIS while two  members were \nunable to be matched to the roll. \n\nNo members were identified as duplicates within the list and four members were identified as \ncross-party duplicates. \n\nOn 14 January 2019,  the Party elected to remove three members from the Party's membership list. \nSee folio 96 for a breakdown of the membership numbers. \n\nA list of 541 members requires contact with a random sample of 47 members under the formula \nprovided by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (folio 94).  For the AEC to be satisfied that the Party \nhas the required 500 members, six denials of membership are permitted. \n\nThe relevant numbers for this membership test were: \n\n1.\n2.\n\n3.\n\nthe random sample size  was 47\nthe AEC attempted to contact 60 members, as some members were uncontactable or\nprovided a neutral response\nthe highest 47 responses were:\n47 confirmed membership\n-\nnone denied membership.\n\nA record of those contacted is at folio 97.  Based on this information the Party's membership list \npassed the membership testing assessment of the application process. \n\nOther procedural application reguirements \nThe application for registration as a political party: \n•\n\nwas in writing, signed by 10 members of the Party, one of whom is the Secretary of the\nParty;\nset out the name and address of the person who is to be the Registered Officer of the Party\nfor the purposes of the Electoral Act;\nadvised whether the Party wishes to receive moneys under Division 3 of Part XX of the\nElectoral Act;\nset out the name and address of the applicants and particulars of the capacity in which\neach applicant makes the application;  and\nwas accompanied by a fee of $500.\n\n•\n\n•\n\n•\n\n•\n\n3 \n\nLS7540 Released Document No. 4Freedom of Information Release\n\n\n--- Page 4 ---\n\nFreedom of Information Release\n\n\n--- Page 5 ---\n\nFreedom of Information Release\n\n\n--- Page 6 ---\n\nFreedom of Information Release\n\n\n--- Page 7 ---\n\nREDACTION CODES \n\nPersonal Information (name) redacted. \n\nPersonal Information (date of birth) redacted. \n\nPersonal Information (photograph) redacted \n\nPersonal Information (facsimile of signature) redacted. \n\nPersonal Information (facsimile of manuscript initialling) redacted. \n\nPersonal Information (Individual’s address) redacted. \n\nPersonal Information (individual’s telephone number) redacted. \n\nPersonal Information (individual’s opinion) redacted. \n\nPersonal Information (opinion about individual) redacted. \n\nPersonal Information (employment history) redacted. \n\nPersonal Information (qualifications) redacted. \n\nPersonal Information (health) redacted. \n\nPersonal Information (identifying individual) redacted. \n\nBusiness information (Bank Account details) redacted. \n\nBusiness information (Billing Account details) redacted. \n\nBusiness information (internal operations) redacted. \n\nLegal Professional Communication redacted. \n\nDeliberative material redacted. \n\nIrrelevant material redacted. \n\nElectoral Roll material redacted. \n\nTests, examinations or audits material redacted. \n\nManagement or assessment of personnel material redacted. \n\nProper and efficient conduct of the operations of AEC material redacted. \n\nLawful methods or procedures for preventing, detecting, investigating, or \ndealing with matters arising out of, breaches or evasions of the law. \n\n1 \n\n2 \n\n3 \n\n4 \n\n5 \n\n6 \n\n7 \n\n8 \n\n9 \n\n10 \n\n11 \n\n12 \n\n13 \n\n14 \n\n15 \n\n16 \n\n17 \n\n18 \n\n19 \n\n20 \n\n21 \n\n22 \n\n23 \n\n24 \n\nFreedom of Information Release\n\n\n\n--- Page 1 ---\n\nNOTICE OF APPLICATION \nFOR REGISTRATION AS A POLITICAL PARTY \n\nThe Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) has received the following application for \nregistration as a political party under the provisions of the Commonwealth Electoral Act \n1918 (the Electoral Act). \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n\nname of party: \n\nAustralian Democrats \n\nproposed registered officer: \n\nDarren Mark Churchill \n\nproposed registered officer’s address: \n\n15 Bassett Street \n\nNAIRNE SA 5252 \n\nthe image displayed here is the \nproposed registered party logo for \nthe Australian Democrats: \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n\nThe Australian Democrats application included: the names, addresses and capacity for all \nsupporting applicants; a list of over 500 members supporting its registration; that it wishes to \nreceive election funding; a copy of its constitution; and payment of the $500 application fee. \n\nYou may lodge an objection if you believe that the application by the Party above should not \nsucceed because, under the Electoral Act: \n\n\n\n\n\n\nthe application does not relate to an eligible political party; or\nthe application is not in accordance with section 126 of the Electoral Act; or\nthe application should be refused under section 129; or\nthe Electoral Commission should refuse to enter a logo of the party in the Register\nunder section 129A.\n\nObjections must be received by the AEC by 26 March 2019, must address the relevant criteria \nabove and be in writing and include your name, street address, signature and the grounds for \nyour objection.

\nRegistered Officer \nAustralian Democrats \nP.O.  Box 547 \nGLENELG SA 5045 \n\nDear Mr Churchill \n\nApproval  of application for  party registration \n\nI  refer to the application lodged on 5 December 2018 to register the Australian Democrats \n(the  Party) as a political party under Part XI of the  Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 \n(the Electoral Act). \n\nAs a delegate of the Electoral Commission I  have approved the application to register the Party. \nThe Party's details have been entered in the Register of Political Parties (the Register). \nEnclosed is a report of the details held in respect to your  Party's registration.  Please contact the \nAustralian Electoral Commission  (AEC) if those details are inaccurate. \n\nThe  Party's details will be included in an amended publication of the  Register available on the \nAEC website within seven days. The AEC will also publish on its website a notice of this \ndecision and a Statement of Reasons. \n\nThe decision of the delegate to approve the Party's registration is a reviewable decision. \nA person (including an organisation) affected by the decision and dissatisfied with it,  may make \na written application to the Electoral Commission requesting a review of the decision within \n28 days of the decision coming to the attention of the affected person. Commissioners of the \nElectoral Commission are the Electoral Commissioner,  a judicial and a non-judicial member. \nAny person affected by and dissatisfied with the outcome of the review by the Electoral \nCommission may request further review by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal in accordance \nwith the Administrative Appeals  Tribunal Act 1975. \n\nRegistration confers a number of entitlements and obligations on political parties.  The \ninformation below provides a brief description of those entitlements and obligations.  I urge you \nto read this information carefully to ensure that you are familiar with the entitlements and \nobligations applying to your Party. \n\nOffice  holders \n\nIn order to access the entitlements of registration, political parties must provide details of \nparticular party office holders to the AEC.  The same person can  hold a number of positions at \nthe same time. \n\nRegistered Officer and Deputy Registered Officer \n\nThe  Registered Officer and  Deputy Registered Officers of a party can nominate the party's \nendorsed candidates for a federal election. \n\n50 Marcus Clarke Street \nCanberra ACT 2600 \n\nLocked Bag 4007 \nCanberra ACT 2601 \n\nEmail fad@aec.gov.au \nTel 02 6271  4552
