            "text": "This document is an email exchange from April 2022 between Meg Mackie, a Government Lawyer at the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC), and a Google Australia Government Affairs and Public Policy Manager. It details the AEC's specific request for the removal of three YouTube videos due to their alleged breach of s 321D(5) of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918, which pertains to unauthorised electoral matter. The AEC identifies the videos as containing electoral content intended to influence voting, depicting a candidate from \"freedom-friendly parties,\" and being unauthorised. The correspondence confirms Google's receipt of the complaint, the AEC's internal policy for such submissions, and Google's subsequent action: the removal of two of the three flagged videos, with the third remaining under review.\n\nThis document is highly relevant to the FOI request (LEX3037) as it provides concrete evidence of the AEC's \"proactive engagement\" and \"direct communication channels and content referrals\" with major tech companies, specifically Google/YouTube. It directly illustrates the Electoral Integrity Assurance Taskforce's efforts to identify, monitor, and address \"non-compliant content\" (unauthorised electoral matter in this case) to safeguard election integrity during the lead-up to the 2022 federal election, aligning perfectly with the FOI request's overview of the AEC's collaboration with platforms like Google."
