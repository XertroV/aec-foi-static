            "text": "The released FOI documents paint a concerning picture of government operations, highlighting a profound lack of transparency and a cavalier approach to taxpayer funds. The high number of documents entirely withheld (S47(1)(b) exemption) and those heavily redacted (S47F, S22, S47E exemptions) immediately raises alarms, suggesting a deliberate effort to obscure the full details of contracts and communications, preventing genuine public scrutiny.\n\nFinancial management appears to be significantly flawed, with evidence pointing to potential waste and uncontrolled spending. The advertising agency, BMF, repeatedly highlights issues with cost estimates, including a notable admission that \"production costs to create a new TVC edit\" and expenses for \"new integrate partnerships\" were *not initially accounted for* in their estimates. This suggests either incredibly poor upfront planning by the government in defining campaign scope or a willingness to approve projects with open-ended budgets that are prone to substantial creep. Furthermore, the agency proceeds with significant portions of the work (e.g., retainer fees, digital display, content & social) *before* critical elements like \"TVC costs\" are \"formalised,\" indicating a dangerous precedent of committing funds without a complete financial picture. The mention of payment terms being driven by \"EOFY\" (end of financial year) deadlines raises suspicions that spending may be rushed to deplete allocated budgets rather than for genuine strategic need or value for money.\n\nProject management and decision-making within the government department appear to be inefficient and reactive. The advertising agency frequently seeks \"clarity\" on fundamental aspects of the campaign, such as the \"strategic thinking\" behind social media video lengths or the specific requirements for \"horizontal META formats.\" This constant back-and-forth indicates vague or incomplete briefs from the government, leading to delays, potential rework, and wasted agency time – all ultimately paid for by the public. The agency's request to \"start our WIPs from next week\" suggests a lack of established, proactive communication channels, forcing a reactive approach to an ongoing project. Even basic administrative functions, like confirming who to \"address our invoices to\" due to \"staff movements,\" hint at internal disorganisation. Most critically, the delay in the government confirming the \"Authorisation message\" directly impacts the formalisation of \"TVC costs,\" holding up a key campaign element due to internal indecision.\n\nIn summary, these documents reveal a government operating with a concerning degree of opacity, engaging in questionable financial practices, and demonstrating a clear lack of foresight and effective project management in its dealings with external contractors. The repeated need for clarification from the agency, coupled with unbudgeted costs and work proceeding without full financial approval, points to systemic inefficiencies and a potential disregard for prudent spending of public funds."

We created a 30” TVC last election \n  30” formality: As mentioned on the call we couldn’t fit the current script into this length. We could look at a 30” that raises awareness of the two ballot papers, and \n\nthen use either one 30” or 2 x 15” on how to complete. \n\no  We have not allowed for production costs to create a new TVC edit either. \n\n  Cinema formality – we would recommended keeping the 60” here given it is an option \n  Can we have some more clarity around the integrate partnerships and what assets we will need to provide/create for those? \n\no \n\nIf they are new, we haven’t allowed for those in the current estimates \n\n  Can we confirm what the horizontal META formats are or are they only for WeChat and Weibo? \n\no  Also, are we reading the plan correctly and are we only going to be creating 15” social video assets? If so, what is the strategic thinking behind not \n\nproducing 6” and 10”? \n\no  To confirm as well, are we not providing social static assets for social? \n  Will we need two versions of the Formality OOH again – with and without the QR code? \n  Will UM be producing the live read pointers and the handicapped radio assets again? \n\nAlso attached is the updated asset delivery timeline which we touched on in our last regroup. Let us know if you have any queries on that. \n\nWould also be great to start our WIPs from next week too if you are available?  \n\nI believe we said Tuesday originally but would Wednesday 5th June between 9:30 and 12pm work for you then we can lock them in weekly ongoing. \n\nCheers, \n\nAccount Director (She/Her) \n\nBMF.COM.AU \n\nGadigal Country  \nLevel 2, 100 Harris Street  \nPyrmont, NSW 2009 Australia \n\n2023 Award for Culture & Bravery—B&T  \n2022 Creative & Agency of the Year—AdNews \n2022 Branding, Design & CX Agency of the Year—B&T \n2021 Australia’s Most Effective Agency—WARC \n2021 NSW Agency of the Year—B&T \n2020 APAC & Australia Effectiveness Grand Prix—Effies \n2020 Agency of the Year & Culture Award—Mumbrella \n2019 Agency of the Year—Effies & Campaign Brief \n2019 NSW, Advertising & Agency of the Year—B&T   \n\nWe acknowledge the traditional custodians of the land on which we work, the Gadigal people of the Eora nation, and pay our respects to their Elders past, present and future. \n\nFrom: \nDate: Wednesday, 29 May 2024 at 1:30 PM \nTo: \nCc: \nSubject: Re: For action: UM Village meeting follow up [SEC=UNOFFICIAL] \n\nHi \n\nThank you for sending this through. \n\n2\n\ns 47Fs 47Fs 47Fs 47Fs 47Fs 47Fs 47Fs 47Fs 47Fs 47Fs 47(F)s 47Es 47E\n\n\n--- Page 3 ---\n\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 1 ---\n\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 1 ---\n\nFrom: \nSent: Monday, June 24, 2024 6:30 PM \nTo: \nCc: \nSubject: Un-dated Phase Formal Cost estimates \n\nCAUTION: This email originated from outside of the Australian Federal Government.
