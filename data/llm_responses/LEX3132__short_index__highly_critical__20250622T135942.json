Despite Flux's good-faith submission of a substantial new 4,680-name membership list, the AEC's internal communications reveal a brazen pre-judgement of failure on March 1st—referencing an old test and poisoning the well—before new evidence was even genuinely considered. The subsequent request for \"new testing\" on March 2nd was nothing more than an empty gesture, exposed as a sham by the March 21st \"Minute\" astonishingly declaring a \"failed\" outcome within an impossibly short 19-day timeframe for any rigorous ABS methodology test, unequivocally proving the conclusion was fabricated before evidence could possibly be gathered. This shocking sequence demonstrates an electoral commission steeped in bureaucratic contempt, actively undermining due process, exhibiting either profound incompetence or malicious intent, and ultimately crushing democratic rights through procedural deceit and a rigid, anti-democratic tunnel vision that prioritised pre-ordained outcomes over fair assessment."

  "prompt": "With a highly critical view, provide a scathing, single-paragraph summary in markdown format of the following FOI request overview:\n\nSummary:\n\nThe FOI documents expose a meticulously choreographed bureaucratic charade, designed to present a veneer of process while relentlessly pursuing a predetermined outcome: the deregistration of VOTEFLUX.ORG | Upgrade Democracy!.\n\nThe request itself, seeking \"attempts to understand and evaluate the arguments\" and \"validity of the statistical claims\" from Flux's appeal, is met with deafening silence and damning contradiction within the retrieved documents. There is not a single shred of evidence of any genuine \"understanding\" or \"evaluation\" of Flux's specific arguments or statistical claims. Instead, the AEC adheres to a rigid, unthinking adherence to a singular \"ABS methodology\" for membership testing, effectively dismissing any nuanced appeal.\n\nThe timeline alone screams incompetence and malice:\n\n*   **February 13, 2022:** Flux responds to the deregistration notice, providing a substantial new membership list of **4,680 names** – vastly exceeding the 1,500 member threshold. This is a direct, good-faith attempt to demonstrate compliance.\n*   **March 1, 2022:** An internal email, ostensibly seeking approval to forward information to the delegate, brazenly states that Flux \"did not pass membership testing.\" This refers to an *old* test from December 2021, and critically, *pre-judges* the outcome of the delegate's consideration of Flux's *new* evidence. This is not objective advice; it is a calculated attempt to poison the well and steer the delegate towards a pre-ordained conclusion.\n*   **March 2, 2022:** The delegate (Joanne Reid) requests new membership testing on the submitted 4,680-name list, specifically asking to test the \"top 1,650 names.\" This acknowledges the new submission but sets the stage for a mechanical, rather than substantive, review.\n*   **March 21, 2022:** A \"Minute: For action – Deregistration\" is prepared. This document astonishingly declares that \"An assessment of the Party’s membership list was undertaken and based on the ABS methodology it demonstrated that the Party has failed to demonstrate to have at least 1,500 members.\" This is a mere **19 days** after the delegate *initiated* the request for the new membership test. The claim that a comprehensive \"ABS methodology\" test on 1,650 names (requiring contact, verification, and data analysis) could be completed, processed, and unequivocally declared a \"failure\" within this impossibly short timeframe is not merely implausible – it is a lie. It indicates that the \"new testing\" was either a sham, or the outcome was decided well in advance of any actual test results. The conclusion was written before the evidence could possibly be gathered.\n\nThis sequence reveals a shocking level of bureaucratic contempt:\n\n1.  **Predetermined Guilt:** The AEC's internal communications actively frame the party as failing *before* new evidence is considered, and certainly before any new testing could be completed.\n2.  **Procedural Facade:** The request for \"new testing\" on March 2nd was nothing more than an empty gesture, a box-ticking exercise to mask a foregone conclusion. The March 21st minute exposes this as a cynical charade.\n3.  **Disregard for Due Process:** The very purpose of the s137 notice – to allow the party to provide reasons why it *should not* be deregistered – was fundamentally undermined. Flux submitted new, compelling evidence, which the AEC demonstrably failed to genuinely assess. Their focus remained fixated on a past failure, despite new information directly addressing the issue.\n4.  **Incompetence or Malice:** Either the AEC is so incompetent that it believes a rigorous statistical test can be completed in under three weeks, or it is so malicious that it intentionally fabricated the \"failed\" outcome before the test was even finished. Both interpretations are damning.\n5.  **Bureaucratic Tunnel Vision:** The documents show a complete inability or unwillingness to engage with any arguments beyond a narrow, pre-defined \"membership testing methodology,\" highlighting a rigid, anti-democratic bureaucracy incapable of genuine discretion or fair consideration.\n\nThe fact that Flux was also actively working to update its name and logo further underscores the devastating impact of this pre-meditated deregistration, crushing their efforts and nullifying their administrative actions without a fair hearing. These documents are not just a record of deregistration; they are an indictment of an electoral commission seemingly operating with predetermined outcomes, procedural deceit, and a chilling disregard for the democratic rights of political parties.\n\nProvide only the markdown formatted summary text. Do not include any conversational filler or preamble."
