The inquiry was initiated following public complaints and media reports, including from *The Guardian*, which alleged Laming used numerous pages (e.g., \"Redland Bay Bulletin,\" \"Redlands Institute\") disguised as community or news groups to promote political content and attack opponents without mandatory disclosures.\n\nThe AEC confirmed an active investigation, noting that 2018 Electoral Act amendments broadened social media authorisation requirements. The investigation involved issuing formal notices to Laming for detailed information and to third parties, such as Facebook, for data, with Facebook confirming its cooperation. Findings revealed that some of the identified pages were subsequently removed or updated with authorisation disclosures, while others reportedly remained active and unauthorised.\n\n**Relevance to the FOI Request:**\nThis document directly addresses the core subject of the FOI request, providing a comprehensive overview of the AEC's investigation into Andrew Laming MP's Facebook pages. It outlines the specific allegations regarding non-compliant political content, the legal framework underpinning the inquiry (2018 Electoral Act amendments), the investigative steps taken by the AEC (notices to Laming and Facebook), and the outcomes, including actions taken on the implicated pages. It is central to understanding the scope, process, and findings of the AEC's inquiry into electoral authorisation compliance."
