The mention of \"FAD\" (likely referring to Federal Authorisation or Disclosure) further links the public discourse to the core issue of electoral authorisation laws, which is central to the FOI request."

Do not include any conversational filler or preamble.To aid you, the overview of the FOI request is: [REQUEST OVERVIEW START] The FOI request disclosed documents detailing the Australian Electoral Commission's (AEC) investigation into Andrew Laming MP's Facebook pages for compliance with federal electoral authorisation laws. This inquiry was triggered by public complaints and media reports, notably from *The Guardian*, alleging Laming used numerous pages (e.g., \"Redland Bay Bulletin,\" \"Redlands Institute\") disguised as community or news groups to promote political content and attack opponents without mandatory disclosures. The AEC confirmed an active investigation, noting 2018 Electoral Act amendments broadened social media authorisation, and issued formal notices to Laming for detailed information and to third parties (like Facebook) for data, with Facebook confirming its cooperation. Findings revealed some pages were removed or updated with authorisation, while others remained active and unauthorised.\n [REQUEST OVERVIEW END] \n\n--- MAIN DOCUMENT TEXT START ---\n\n\n\n--- Page 1 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 2 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 3 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 4 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 5 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 6 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 7 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 8 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 9 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 10 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 11 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 12 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 13 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 14 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 15 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 16 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 17 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 18 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 19 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 20 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 21 ---\n\nAEC.0002.0001.2786\n\n  8-14 April 2021 Third-party posts: Andrew Laming, Facebook and FAD  There was social media chatter about: Facebook appearance at a Senate committee hearing, the action that should be taken against Andrew Laming MP and Santos donations to political parties.\n\n\n--- Page 22 ---\n\nAEC.0002.0001.2787\n\n\n--- Page 23 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 24 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 25 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 26 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 27 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 28 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 29 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 30 ---\n\nAEC.0002.0001.2795\n\n\n--- Page 31 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 32 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 33 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 34 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 35 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 36 ---\n\nAEC.0002.0001.2801\n\n\n--- Page 37 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 38 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 39 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 40 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 41 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 42 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 43 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 44 ---\n\n\n\n"
