            "text": "This summary details FOI Request LS7791 concerning objections to the registration of \"The Women's Party\".\n\n### Main Purpose of the FOI Request\nThe primary purpose of FOI Request LS7791 was to obtain unredacted copies of approximately 30 objections lodged with the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) against the registration of \"The Women's Party\". These objections were made during the application process, in response to AEC advertising calling for objections under Section 132 of the Electoral Act.\n\n### Documents from the FOI Request\nThe released documents consist of multiple emails from third-party individuals to the AEC. These emails were sent between January 22, 2019, and February 10, 2019. The schedule of published documents lists 15 distinct emails (Document Nos. 1, 3, 5, 6, 11, 13, 16, 17, 20, 21, 24, 25, 26, 32), all described as \"Email from third party individual to the AEC re registration of The Women’s Party.\"\n\n### Main Content from the FOI Request Documents\nThe core content of the released emails reveals a consistent set of objections and concerns regarding the proposed registration of \"The Women's Party\":\n\n*   **Misleading Name & Confusion:** Many objectors argued that the name \"The Women's Party\" is misleading. They frequently cited that \"The Women's Party\" is internationally known as a Radical Feminist Party and that registering a \"non-feminist party\" under this name would cause significant confusion among voters, potentially garnering \"false votes.\"\n*   **Registrant's Identity (Divvi de Vendre):** A central point of contention was the identity of the registered officer, Divvi de Vendre, who is consistently identified by objectors as a transgender individual born male.\n    *   Objectors stated that the party's registration by a biological male was \"misleading and offensive\" and incompatible with a party named \"Women's Party,\" which they believe should be led by and represent biological females with female-centred politics.\n    *   Some emails explicitly stated that the name \"excludes women born women\" if based on \"notions of gender rather than that of biological sex.\"\n*   **Political Sabotage:** Several objections framed the registration as an \"act of sabotage of grassroots feminist work\" and a hindrance to the formation of a strong, genuine \"Women's Party\" in Australia. Concerns were raised that it could prevent the reactivation of a previously feminist-aligned party that had used similar names.\n*   **Intent and Propaganda:** One objection specifically suggested the party's intent was to mislead \"less-politically savvy females\" and disseminate \"anti-woman propaganda.\"\n*   **Legal Grounds:** Objectors referenced various sections of the Australian Electoral Act in their formal objections, including Section 132 (the general provision for objections), Section 129, Section 137 Subsection 2, Section 134A, and Section 138A."

According to my reading this title has been used by feminist\nbased parties working towards equality and women’s interests in general.\nIn my view and not having seen the manifesto of the proposed party, I contend that unless the\nproposed party is not clearly focussed on the best interests of women, particularly equal ty, then\nthe title The Women’s Party would be false and misleading.\nIf that were the case, then registration should not be allowed.\n\n1613Released under the Freedom of Information Act 1982\n\n\n\n--- Page 1 ---\n\nLS7791 Released Document No. 32\n\nFrom:\nTo:\nSubject:\nDate:\n\nFAD\nObjection to the Women’s Party\nSunday, 10 February 2019 4:32:28 PM\n\nI am lodging an objection to the naming of the Women’s Party under\nSection 129 of the Australian Electoral Act.\nMy objections are as follows:\n\nI object to the name Women’s Party on the grounds that it is based on\nnotions of gender rather than that of biological sex and therefore\nexcludes women born women.\nThe term Women’s Party cannot be inclusive of all women when the\nregistered officer of the party is Divvi De Vendre, a transgender born\nmale.\n\n-- \n\n13167Released under the Freedom of Information Act 1982\n\n\n\n--- Page 1 ---\n\nLS7791 Released Document No. 5\n\nReleased under the Freedom of Information Act 1982\n\n\n\n--- Page 1 ---\n\nLS7791 Released Document No. 6\n\nFrom:\nTo:\nSubject:\nDate:\n\nINFO\n[QUESTION Other] \nWednesday, 23 January 2019 11:26:05 AM\n\n(\n\n *WWW* [SEC=UNCLASSIFIED]\n\nI have an enquiry\n\nCategory\n\nOther\n\nContact details\n\nGiven name(s):\nSurname:\nEmail:\nPhone number:\nPostcode:\n\nEnquiry details\n\nA trans-gender male to female person Divvi De Vendre has lodged an \napplication to establish a political party \"the Australian Women's Party\". \nWhilst I have no objection to any individual starting a political party this \nname was already used some time ago and may confuse women like \nmyself who would think it was the old party reactivated.
