            "text": "This document consists of an email exchange between Jeff Pope, Deputy Electoral Commissioner of the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC), and representatives from Meta/Facebook, dated April 2021. The correspondence details the scheduling of a call between AEC and Meta personnel, including Meta's Sydney/Singapore and California-based teams. The purpose of the requested call, initiated by Meta, was to \"make sure that we are providing the support the AEC needs in relation to [redacted].\"\n\n**Relevance to FOI Request LEX1697:**\nThis document is highly relevant as it demonstrates direct correspondence and coordination between the AEC and Meta (a major social media platform specified in the request) in April 2021, falling within the requested timeframe (from May 2019). The communication illustrates the AEC's ongoing engagement with social media platforms, specifically establishing and utilizing clear communication channels (\"a quick call?\") to ensure Meta provides \"support\" to the AEC. Although the specific topic of support is redacted, the context of high-level communication to offer and receive assistance aligns with the FOI request's focus on collaboration and preparations for the 2022 Federal election, including discussions on electoral integrity and combating misinformation/disinformation."

Do not include any conversational filler or preamble.To aid you, the overview of the FOI request is: [REQUEST OVERVIEW START] The FOI request LEX1697 sought Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) correspondence with major social media platforms (Meta, Twitter, Google, LinkedIn, ByteDance/TikTok) from May 2019, specifically concerning Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 compliance and 2022 Federal election preparations.
