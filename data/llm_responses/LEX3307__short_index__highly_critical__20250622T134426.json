  "prompt": "With a highly critical view, provide a scathing, single-paragraph summary in markdown format of the following FOI request overview:\n\nSummary:\n\nThe AEC's response to a critical FOI request regarding electoral integrity, physical security, and vote-counting algorithms (specifically mentioning \"LEX3029\") is a contemptible display of bureaucratic evasion and deliberate obfuscation.\n\n1.  **Systematic Information Suppression:** Despite the FOI request spanning a 6.5-month critical period (March-September 2022) and explicitly demanding discussions on core electoral vulnerabilities, the AEC released only *one* set of minutes from a single meeting on March 29, 2022. This constitutes a brazen and calculated act of withholding information, indicating a deep-seated reluctance to expose the true state of electoral integrity discussions. The \"N/A\" exemption and \"Access in full\" for this lone document are a cynical smokescreen, designed to appear compliant while providing nothing of substance.\n\n2.  **Deliberate Irrelevance and Distraction:** The *entire content* of the sole released document concerns the perfunctory review and upholding of a minor party's deregistration due to membership numbers. This administrative minutia is fundamentally irrelevant to the core and explicit concerns of the FOI request, particularly regarding physical security of operations, the accuracy and legality of \"counting algorithms,\" and the specific \"LEX3029\" vulnerability. Its release is a calculated act of misdirection, providing a token document to satisfy the letter of the law while completely ignoring the spirit and critical intent of the inquiry. This is not transparency; it is mockery.\n\n3.  **Damning Absence of Critical Discussions:** The complete and utter absence of any discussion within the released minutes regarding physical security, vote-counting algorithms, or the specific \"LEX3029\" exploit—especially during a crucial period leading directly into a federal election—is damning. This implies one of two catastrophic failures:\n    *   **Gross Negligence and Incompetence:** The Commission is criminally negligent in its duties, failing to address fundamental and pressing concerns about the integrity and security of the electoral process at the highest level. Their operational priorities appear catastrophically misaligned, focusing on trivial administrative tasks while ignoring existential threats to democratic trust.\n    *   **Malicious Concealment:** Alternatively, critical discussions on these highly sensitive topics are being deliberately sequestered into unrecorded sessions or their minutes are being systematically withheld from public scrutiny. This points directly to a concerted effort to conceal information that could expose profound systemic failures, corruption, or unaddressed vulnerabilities within the electoral system.\n\nThe AEC's response is not merely a failure of transparency; it is a profound indictment of its commitment to democratic integrity, strongly implying either a deep-seated incompetence in managing critical risks or a deliberate effort to keep vital information about the nation's electoral security hidden from public accountability.\n\nProvide only the markdown formatted summary text. Do not include any conversational filler or preamble."
