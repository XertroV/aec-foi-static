Application Submission and Initial Assessment:**\n*   The Australian Democrats submitted their application around December 5, 2018, including their constitution, an initial membership list of 550 members, a proposed logo, and the $500 application fee. (Documents 3, 40, 42, 48)\n*   The AEC acknowledged receipt of partial and then full application documents. (Documents 41, 48)\n*   Initial internal assessment confirmed the party's eligibility based on its constitution and other procedural requirements. (Document 4)\n\n**2. Membership Validation:**\n*   The AEC's internal review matched 513 of the initially submitted 550 members to the electoral roll automatically, with a further 35 manually identified, and 2 unmatched. (Document 49)\n*   The party subsequently requested the removal of 3 members due to resignations, reducing the total enrolled members to 541. (Documents 51, 52, 53)\n*   A random sample of 47 members was contacted for verification (based on ABS confidence tables for 541 members, allowing 6 denials). All 47 contacts confirmed membership, and none denied, leading to a \"PASS\" result for membership testing. (Document 74)\n\n**3. Logo Assessment:**\n*   The initially submitted logo did not pass the AEC's validation requirements (e.g., colour other than 100% black, page size, live text, raster images). (Document 50)\n*   Multiple revised logos were submitted by the Australian Democrats. (Documents 57, 59)\n*   The final submitted logo was assessed against the *Commonwealth Electoral (Logo Requirements) Determination 2016* and passed validation. A background check by an external contractor found no similar existing logos. (Documents 4, 58, 61, 63, 64, 65, 66)\n\n**4. Public Notification and Objection Process:**\n*   A \"Notice of Application\" for the Australian Democrats' registration was published, inviting objections by March 26, 2019. (Document 5, 87, 88)\n*   The FOI Applicant (also an objector) initiated correspondence with the AEC regarding the policy on de-identifying objections and supporting documents, citing privacy concerns for individuals and potential defamation. (Documents 90, 92)\n*   An objection to the application was lodged on March 25, 2019. (Documents 7, 8, 93)\n*   The AEC formally notified the Australian Democrats of the objection. (Documents 16, 97)\n*   The Australian Democrats submitted a response to the objection on March 29, 2019, including a statutory declaration in support. (Documents 19, 98, 99)\n*   The FOI Applicant requested further redactions to the Australian Democrats' response due to privacy and potential defamatory content, which the AEC actioned and published an updated redacted version online. (Documents 100, 101, 102)\n\n**5. Final Determination and Approval:**\n*   An internal AEC minute dated April 6, 2019, recommended the final determination and approval of the Australian Democrats' application. (Document 2)\n*   On April 7, 2019, the Australian Democrats National President sent a letter expressing concern about delays in the registration process and its impact on their ability to contest the upcoming federal election, urging prompt finalisation. (Documents 104, 105)\n*   The National Secretary later requested this letter be disregarded. (Document 106)\n*   The AEC officially approved the application for registration of the Australian Democrats as a political party on April 7, 2019. (Documents 36, 107)\n*   Both the Australian Democrats and the FOI Applicant were notified of the approval. (Documents 38, 109)\n*   The Australian Democrats expressed their appreciation to the AEC for the approval. (Document 110)\n*   The official Registered Political Party Details for the Australian Democrats were recorded. (Document 108)\n\nProvide only the markdown formatted summary text. Do not include any conversational filler or preamble."
