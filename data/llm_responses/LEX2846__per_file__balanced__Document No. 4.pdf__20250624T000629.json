            "text": "The document consists of internal Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) contact centre scripts and information regarding the **COVID-19 Secure Telephone Voting** service for the 2022 federal election, outlining its operational implementation.\n\n**Key aspects detailed include:**\n*   **Eligibility Criteria:** The criteria for telephone voting evolved, initially requiring a positive COVID-19 test after 6pm Tuesday 17 May, then expanded to after 6pm Friday 13 May, and subsequently Saturday 14 May, with the elector needing to be in isolation on Election Day (May 21). Evidence (PCR or RAT details with health authority reference) was required.\n*   **Registration and Voting Process:** Electors registered online or via a dedicated phone line (1800 413 960). Registration involved providing evidence of COVID-19, declaring isolation, and selecting a secure PIN, after which an eight-digit registration number was issued. To vote, electors called back, provided their registration number and PIN (ensuring secrecy), viewed ballot papers online, and verbally conveyed their preferences to an operator.\n*   **Operational Management:** The document provided specific operating hours and advised callers of expected \"long call wait times\" due to high demand and the longer nature of phone voting. It confirmed that electors on hold at the 6pm poll closing time on Election Day would still be able to vote.\n*   **Accessibility:** Services included access to multilingual interpreters and specific provisions for deaf voters via Auslan interpreters through Convo Australia.\n*   **Integrity and Secrecy:** Vote secrecy was maintained by using unique registration numbers and PINs instead of personal details during the voting call. The document affirmed that ballot paper handling and counting procedures, including scrutineer observation, followed the same stringent security requirements as in-person polling.\n*   **Compulsory Voting:** It clarified that being COVID-19 positive and in isolation on Election Day constituted a valid and sufficient reason for not voting, provided evidence was supplied if a non-voter notice was issued.\n*   **Polling Place COVID-Safe Measures:** The document outlined various measures implemented at Early Voting Centres and Polling Places, such as capacity limits, hand sanitiser availability, regular cleaning of surfaces, single-use how-to-vote cards, dedicated queue controllers and hygiene officers, bio-waste bins, signage, floor markers, and encouragement for voters to bring their own pencils.\n\n**Relevance to FOI Request LEX2846:**\nThis document is highly relevant to FOI request LEX2846 as it directly illustrates the AEC's **extensive preparations for conducting federal elections amidst the COVID-19 pandemic**. It serves as a practical demonstration of the **\"Customer Journey\" plans and staff scripts** developed for the **Commonwealth Electoral (COVID Enfranchisement) Regulations 2022**, particularly detailing the operational mechanics of the **secure telephone voting system**. The challenges highlighted, such as long wait times, implicitly point to the **logistical challenges** faced by the AEC. The dynamic changes in eligibility criteria noted in the document reflect the AEC's need for and adaptation to **legislative flexibility for emergency election management**. Furthermore, the document explicitly details the **COVID-safe measures** implemented at polling places and reinforces the mechanisms (e.g., vote secrecy, scrutineer observation) used to maintain the **integrity** of these new voting methods."

Do not include any conversational filler or preamble.To aid you, the overview of the FOI request is: [REQUEST OVERVIEW START] The FOI request LEX2846 illuminated the Australian Electoral Commission's (AEC) extensive preparations for conducting federal elections amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. Released documents detailed the **Commonwealth Electoral (COVID Enfranchisement) Regulations 2022**, establishing a secure telephone voting system for eligible self-isolating voters diagnosed close to polling day, supported by detailed \"Customer Journey\" plans and staff scripts. The AEC also adapted its **postal voting policy** for COVID-positive individuals and noted reduced mobile polling. Revealed were significant **logistical and financial challenges**, including projected cost increases and staffing difficulties, prompting the AEC to seek greater legislative flexibility for emergency election management. The AEC ensured **COVID-safe measures** at polling places and maintained the integrity of new voting methods through staff neutrality, scrutineer observation, and robust complaint mechanisms.\n [REQUEST OVERVIEW END] \n\n--- MAIN DOCUMENT TEXT START ---\n\n\n\n--- Page 1 ---\n\nElection Contact Centre Application Home Page:- \nCovid-19 Secure Telephone Voting Information \nNotices \n\nEligibility to phone vote  \n\nIssue:  \nThe Electoral Commissioner Tom Rogers has this morning signed a brief to Government recommending \nthat the eligibility for telephone voting services for people who have tested positive to COVID-19 be \nexpanded. \n\nThis would see electors who have tested positive to COVID-19 since Saturday 14 May 2022 being able to \nalso phone vote. \n\n(Further information will be provided shortly) \n\nEligibility to phone vote  \n\nIssue:  \nThe Electoral Commissioner Tom Rogers has this morning signed a brief to Government recommending \nthat the eligibility for telephone voting services for people who have tested positive to COVID-19 be \nexpanded. \n\n•  At this stage eligibility to use the telephone voting service remains that electors need to have \n\ntested positive to COVID-19 after 6pm Tuesday 17 May  \n\n• \n\nIf this changes today there will be public communications to advise the detail \n\n•  AEC general enquiries staff are not to provide the Secure Telephone Voting number for COVID-19 \naffected electors to callers who do not meet the criteria.

The number could be on the front or back \nof the packet, or next to an image or icon. It’s ok if you can’t find it – but to prove eligibility, you do \nneed to provide the brand and receipt number from the health authority that registered the positive \ntest (if available).  \n\n5\n\n\n--- Page 6 ---\n\nI can’t find my registration number or PIN \n\nWhen you registered, the operator will have asked if you wanted to receive your registration \nnumber and PIN by SMS or email.

Thanks for your patience as we work to help all eligible people cast their vote. \n\nHow long voting takes by phone \n\nThis is not a service the AEC usually provides, so voting by phone will take longer than if this was \ndone in person or by post. The operator needs to follow a process that keeps your vote secure. \nThey must confirm your details, find the ballot papers for your electoral division, record how you \nwish to vote for both papers, read back your selection and then re-confirm this is how you wish to \nvote.  \n\nTo make things quicker and reduce wait times, visit the AEC website to look at an image of ballot \npapers for your electoral division and consider your preferences before calling to vote. \n\nWhat will happen if I’m still on hold after 6pm on election \nday? \n\nYou’ll still be able to cast your vote if you registered and are waiting on the line to vote when polls \nclose at 6.00pm on Saturday 21 May.
