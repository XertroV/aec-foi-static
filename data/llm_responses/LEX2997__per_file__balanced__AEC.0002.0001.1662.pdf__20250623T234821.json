Its relevance to the FOI request lies in a headline on page 5, under the \"IN OTHER NEWS\" section, which states \"LNP dumps Laming from seat\". While this snippet does not detail the Australian Electoral Commission's (AEC) investigation into Andrew Laming MP's Facebook pages directly, it provides contextual evidence of significant contemporary media and political attention surrounding Andrew Laming during the period the AEC's inquiry was active. This aligns with the FOI request overview, which notes the AEC investigation was \"triggered by public complaints and media reports\" concerning Laming. The mention confirms Laming was a subject of notable news coverage, potentially related to or coinciding with the issues that prompted the AEC's compliance review."

Do not include any conversational filler or preamble.To aid you, the overview of the FOI request is: [REQUEST OVERVIEW START] The FOI request disclosed documents detailing the Australian Electoral Commission's (AEC) investigation into Andrew Laming MP's Facebook pages for compliance with federal electoral authorisation laws. This inquiry was triggered by public complaints and media reports, notably from *The Guardian*, alleging Laming used numerous pages (e.g., \"Redland Bay Bulletin,\" \"Redlands Institute\") disguised as community or news groups to promote political content and attack opponents without mandatory disclosures. The AEC confirmed an active investigation, noting 2018 Electoral Act amendments broadened social media authorisation, and issued formal notices to Laming for detailed information and to third parties (like Facebook) for data, with Facebook confirming its cooperation. Findings revealed some pages were removed or updated with authorisation, while others remained active and unauthorised.\n [REQUEST OVERVIEW END] \n\n--- MAIN DOCUMENT TEXT START ---\n\n\n\n--- Page 1 ---\n\nAEC.0002.0001.1662\n\nFrom:                                 The AustralianSent:                                  Tue, 13 Apr 2021 06:06:00 +1000To:                                      Jeff PopeSubject:                             AM Edition + your daily COVID-19 briefingCAUTION: This email originated from outside of the Australian Federal Government.

Vaccine passports are the least-cost way to put COVID restrictions behind us. Far from banning them, governments should help set up a way for the vaccinated to prove their status so they can get on with their lives exempt from lockdowns and mask mandates, writes Adam Creighton.I braced for a rugged few days after my shot but I didn’t feel even the slightest side effect.
