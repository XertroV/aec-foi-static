            "text": "This document, dated March-June 2018, consists of internal emails between Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) staff (Angelo Rojas, Guy Lewis, Warrick Poyser, Michael Roden, Stephanie Maxwell, Delyse Paliaga, Gina Dario) concerning data analysis for Indigenous electoral enrolment.\n\n**Summary of Document Content:**\n\n*   **Centrelink Data Utilisation:** The document prominently features the AEC's use of Centrelink data to identify potentially unenrolled Indigenous Australians. Specifically, an email from Guy Lewis (March 2018) details an age breakdown of \"107,607 Indigenous people that are only on the Centrelink file,\" noting that 30.7% (33,008) are in the 18-24 age group.\n*   **Data Refinement and Eligibility:** Discussions include the need to cross-reference this Centrelink data with other sources (e.g., Births, Deaths, and Marriages (BDM) data, deceased persons files, and deleted records) to establish eligibility and remove those who are deceased or previously enrolled, prior to any direct enrolment efforts.\n*   **Enrolment Stimulation and Outreach Analysis:** An email from Angelo Rojas (June 2018) discusses analysis linking new Indigenous enrolments to the proportion of Email/SMS messages provided by state, especially for the 18-39 age group. It identifies lower Email/SMS provision and new enrolments in NT, WA, and SA, hypothesising lower outreach efforts or higher disengagement in these states.\n\n**Relevance to FOI Request LS7888:**\n\nThis document is highly relevant to FOI request LS7888 as it provides direct insight into the **planning and implementation** of the AEC's new methodology for its Indigenous Electoral Participation Program (IEPP) during the 2018-2019 period.\n\n*   **New Methodology:** It explicitly details the AEC's reliance on self-identified Indigeneity data from Centrelink as a core component of the \"more direct method for estimating Indigenous electoral enrolment rates\" and identifying potential unenrolled voters, which was a key aspect of the new methodology. The 107,607 figure directly relates to the efforts to identify \"over 72,000 potentially unenrolled Indigenous Australians\" mentioned in the FOI overview (this document provides a specific number used in early stages).\n*   **Planning and Implementation:** The discussions about data refinement (BDM, deceased persons) illustrate the intricate planning and technical implementation steps involved in validating and utilising this new Centrelink-derived dataset.\n*   **Outcomes and Enrolment Stimulation:** The analysis concerning Email/SMS outreach and its correlation with new enrolments demonstrates the AEC's efforts to track and refine its strategies for \"enrolment stimulation,\" and identify areas of lower engagement, directly addressing another aspect of the FOI request.\n\nThe document does *not* explicitly detail the number of Indigenous people involved in the methodology's development, its final costs, or dedicated AEC staffing, which were identified as gaps in the overall FOI release."

  "prompt": "Considering this document as part of an FOI request, summarize the document and its relevance to the FOI request in markdown format. FYI the overview of the FOI request is: FOI request LS7888 sought documents from 2018-2019 concerning the Australian Electoral Commission's (AEC) new methodology for its Indigenous Electoral Participation Program (IEPP), specifically regarding its planning, implementation, outcomes, Indigenous involvement, and costs. The released documents reveal the AEC transitioned to a more direct method for estimating Indigenous electoral enrolment rates, primarily by utilising self-identified Indigeneity data from Centrelink. This shift, driven by the availability of new Centrelink data, significantly increased estimated Indigenous enrolment rates from approximately 58% (under the old 2014 methodology) to 76.4% by June 2018 and 76.6% by June 2019. The documents detail the new methodology, its impact, and efforts to track enrolment stimulation, including identifying over 72,000 potentially unenrolled Indigenous Australians in mid-2018 and subsequent enrolment events. However, the released content did not explicitly detail the number of Indigenous people involved in the methodology's development or its final costs and dedicated AEC staffing.\n\nDocument Text:\n\n\n\n--- Page 1 ---\n\nFrom: Angelo Rojas <Angelo.Rojas@aec.gov.au>  \nSent: Monday, 4 June 2018 3:45 PM \nTo: Guy Lewis <Guy.Lewis@aec.gov.au> \nCc: Stephanie Maxwell <Stephanie.Maxwell@aec.gov.au> \nSubject: FW: Indigenous data [SEC=UNCLASSIFIED] \n\nGuy - as discussed, the number of new enrolments for Indigenous not on the roll could be predicted to a fair extent by the proportion of Email/SMSs \nprovided by State. Further analysis of this shows that the strong correlation is for people aged 18-39. \n\nThe proportion of people aged 18-39 in NT, WA and SA who provided Email/SMS is low and so is their proportion of new enrolments. This analysis will be \nmore direct when Mike provides me with the extract that includes Email and/or SMS sent to confirm two hypothesis: \n\n1. We are sending less Email/SMS to these states.\n2. Additionally, enrolment response rates are also lower for these states than for the rest (higher level of disengagement).\n\nLS7888 Released Document No. 4Released under the Freedom of Information Act 1982\n\n\n--- Page 2 ---\n\nReleased under the Freedom of Information Act 1982\n\n\n--- Page 3 ---\n\nReleased under the Freedom of Information Act 1982\n\n\n--- Page 4 ---\n\n60-69 \n70+ \n\n1.4% \n0.0% \n100.0% \n\n1.2% \n0.2% \n100.0% \n\n1.8% \n0.4% \n100.0% \n\n1.0% \n0.2% \n100.0% \n\n3.6% \n0.2% \n100.0% \n\n0.8% \n0.0% \n100.0% \n\n1.0% \n0.0% \n100.0% \n\n1.9% \n0.4% \n100.0% \n\n1.4% \n0.2% \n100.0% \n\nTotal % \n\nAngelo Rojas | Senior Project Officer  \nRoll Program & Community Engagement Section | Roll Management & Community Engagement Branch \n\nLS7888 Released Document No. 4Released under the Freedom of Information Act 1982\n\n\n--- Page 5 ---\n\nAustralian Electoral Commission \nT: (02) 6271 4507 X: 21336 M: \n\nFrom: Warrick Poyser  \nSent: Thursday, 8 March 2018 5:12 PM \nTo: Guy Lewis <Guy.Lewis@aec.gov.au> \nCc: Delyse Paliaga <Delyse.Paliaga@aec.gov.au>; Gina Dario <Gina.Dario@aec.gov.au>; Stephanie Maxwell \n<Stephanie.Maxwell@aec.gov.au>; Angelo Rojas <Angelo.Rojas@aec.gov.au>; Michael Roden <Michael.Roden@aec.gov.au> \nSubject: RE: Indigenous data [SEC=UNCLASSIFIED] \n\nThanks Guy – this data is very interesting. \nI suspect we may have to do something additional/special with the BDM data to establish eligibility prior to being able to do any meaningful \ndirect enrolment effort. \n\nWarrick Poyser  \nSystems Delivery & Modernisation Section | Operations Branch \nAustralian Electoral Commission \nT: (02) 6271 4452 X: 21319 M: \n\nFrom: Guy Lewis  \nSent: Thursday, 8 March 2018 3:38 PM \nTo: Warrick Poyser <Warrick.Poyser@aec.gov.au> \nCc: Delyse Paliaga <Delyse.Paliaga@aec.gov.au>; Gina Dario <Gina.Dario@aec.gov.au>; Stephanie Maxwell \n\nLS7888 Released Document No. 4777Released under the Freedom of Information Act 1982\n\n\n--- Page 6 ---\n\n<Stephanie.Maxwell@aec.gov.au>; Angelo Rojas <Angelo.Rojas@aec.gov.au>; Michael Roden <Michael.Roden@aec.gov.au> \nSubject: Indigenous data [SEC=UNCLASSIFIED] \n\nWarrick, the age breakdown of the 107,607 Indigenous people that are only on the Centrelink file is. \n\nYear of Birth \n1900 – 1920 \n1924 – 1930 \n1931 – 1940 \n1941 – 1950 \n1951 – 1960 \n1961 – 1970 \n1971 – 1980 \n1981 – 1990 \n1991 – 2000 \n2001 \n\nNumber \n23  \n239  \n944  \n2,667  \n6,201  \n12,345  \n16,216  \n23,863  \n41,597  \n3,512  \n\nTotal   107,607  \n\n% \n0.02% \n0.2% \n0.9% \n2.5% \n5.8% \n11.5% \n15.1% \n22.2% \n38.7% \n3.3% \n100% \n\nYouth Group (18 to 24)  \n\n33,008  \n\n30.7% \n\nMike is also rerunning the data against the deceased persons file and deleted records to remove those who are deceased and identify those who have been \nenrolled in the past.
