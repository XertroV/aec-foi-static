            "text": "The document, titled \"ATTACHMENT A,\" consists of extracts from the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918, specifically sections 321D and 321F, which are central to the Australian Electoral Commission's (AEC) investigation into electoral authorisation compliance.\n\n**Summary of Document Content:**\n*   **Section 321D (Authorisation of certain electoral matter):** This section defines when electoral matter communicated to a person, particularly an electoral advertisement with paid distribution/production and approved content, requires authorisation. It details the \"notifying particulars\" that must be included, such as the name and relevant town/city of the entity or natural person responsible for authorising \"any other communication\" (which would include social media content). It also highlights civil penalties for non-compliance.\n*   **Section 321F (Electoral Commissioner may obtain information and documents from persons):** This section empowers the Electoral Commissioner to issue written notices to individuals or entities to obtain information or documents relevant to assessing compliance with Section 321D. The Commissioner must consider the costs incurred by the person in complying and must set out the effects of providing false or misleading information.\n\n**Relevance to the FOI Request:**\nThis document provides the legal framework underpinning the AEC's investigation into Andrew Laming MP's Facebook pages.\n*   **Authorisation Requirements:** Section 321D directly addresses the core issue of the FOI request by outlining the mandatory disclosure requirements for political content, especially that which is paid for, communicated via channels like social media, and approved by an entity or person. This section defines what Laming's pages were allegedly failing to comply with by not displaying proper authorisations.\n*   **Investigatory Powers:** Section 321F provides the legal authority for the AEC to issue formal notices to Laming and third parties (such as Facebook) to gather information and documents, as described in the FOI request overview. It confirms the AEC's power to compel data necessary to investigate alleged breaches of authorisation laws.\nIn essence, the document details the specific legislative provisions the AEC used to conduct its inquiry and assess compliance with federal electoral authorisation laws."

Do not include any conversational filler or preamble.To aid you, the overview of the FOI request is: [REQUEST OVERVIEW START] The FOI request disclosed documents detailing the Australian Electoral Commission's (AEC) investigation into Andrew Laming MP's Facebook pages for compliance with federal electoral authorisation laws. This inquiry was triggered by public complaints and media reports, notably from *The Guardian*, alleging Laming used numerous pages (e.g., \"Redland Bay Bulletin,\" \"Redlands Institute\") disguised as community or news groups to promote political content and attack opponents without mandatory disclosures. The AEC confirmed an active investigation, noting 2018 Electoral Act amendments broadened social media authorisation, and issued formal notices to Laming for detailed information and to third parties (like Facebook) for data, with Facebook confirming its cooperation. Findings revealed some pages were removed or updated with authorisation, while others remained active and unauthorised.\n [REQUEST OVERVIEW END] \n\n--- MAIN DOCUMENT TEXT START ---\n\n\n\n--- Page 1 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 2 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 3 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 4 ---\n\nAEC.0002.0001.6894\n\nc:)AEC Australian Electoral Commission • ATTACHMENT A 321D Authorisation of certain electoral matter (1) This section applies in relation to electoral matter that is communicated to a person if: (a) all of the following apply: (i) the matter is an electoral advertisement; (ii) all or part of the distribution or production of the advertisement was paid for; (iii) the content of the advertisement was approved by a person (the notifying entity) (whether or not that person is a person who paid for the distribution or production of the advertisement); or Notifying particulars (5) The notifying entity must ensure that the particulars set out in the following table, and any other particulars determined under subsection (7) for the purposes of this subsection, are notified in accordance with any requirements determined under that subsection.
