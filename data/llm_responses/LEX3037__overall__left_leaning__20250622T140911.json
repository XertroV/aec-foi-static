            "text": "The FOI documents detail correspondence between the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) and major technology companies (Google, Meta, Twitter, TikTok, Microsoft) concerning the integrity of the 2022 Australian federal election. This interaction centers on identifying and responding to various forms of problematic online content, ranging from electoral misinformation to potential foreign interference.\n\n**Corporate Influence & Wealth Distribution:**\nThe documents reveal a significant reliance by the AEC on large, for-profit global technology companies to maintain electoral integrity online. The \"Electoral Integrity Assurance Taskforce\" and its consistent engagement with these tech giants highlight a model where essential democratic functions – policing disinformation, managing communication, and enforcing electoral law online – are largely outsourced to private entities. This aligns with a progressive critique regarding the undue influence of powerful corporations over public infrastructure and democratic processes. While these companies commit resources (e.g., Meta's stated $5-7 billion investment in safety/security), the fundamental power asymmetry is clear: public institutions are dependent on the willingness and operational decisions of private corporations, whose primary obligation is to shareholders. This central role of tech companies in mediating national discourse underscores concerns about wealth concentration and the privatization of public goods, where profits are privatized but societal risks, like disinformation, are broadly socialized.\n\n**Social Justice:**\nFrom a social justice perspective, the AEC's efforts, supported by these platforms, to combat misinformation and unauthorized electoral communications are broadly aligned with ensuring a fair and informed democratic process, a cornerstone of social justice. The detection and removal of content designed to mislead voters on how to cast votes (Scenario 2), impersonate officials (Scenario 3), or contain hate speech (Scenario 10) directly contribute to a more equitable and safe electoral environment. Meta's initiative to translate its \"Check the Facts\" media literacy campaign into Vietnamese, Simplified Chinese, and Arabic is a notable positive step, promoting linguistic diversity and ensuring broader access to accurate information for non-English speaking communities. However, the reactive nature of many content moderation efforts, relying on reports and post-publication removal, may be insufficient to proactively protect marginalized groups from targeted disinformation campaigns.\n\n**Civil Liberties:**\nThe documents highlight a delicate balance between safeguarding electoral integrity and upholding civil liberties, particularly freedom of expression. The AEC's focus on transparency in political advertising (requiring authorization, combating anonymous communications) generally aligns with progressive values by promoting accountability and informed voter choice. However, scenarios like \"electoral communication…brings a Commonwealth agency into disrepute\" (Scenario 9) raise concerns. From a left-leaning perspective, such a broad category could potentially be used to stifle legitimate criticism or dissent against government bodies, blurring the line between protecting democratic institutions and suppressing free speech. Furthermore, the power of tech platforms to remove content based on their internal \"Platform policy\" even when no Commonwealth law is breached (Scenario 11) indicates a significant, non-democratically accountable power to regulate public discourse, which could inadvertently lead to censorship or limit diverse viewpoints. Conversely, instances where Google declined removal requests because content didn't breach *legal policies* (though it might violate platform terms) suggest a degree of adherence to legal frameworks over blanket censorship.\n\n**Environmental Impact:**\nDirect mentions of environmental impact are absent from these documents, as their scope is strictly electoral integrity. However, Meta's \"social issue ads\" policy, which includes \"environmental politics\" as an area requiring transparency, suggests a superficial alignment with environmental transparency efforts by requiring disclosure for related political advertisements. This is not an assessment of environmental impact itself, but rather a regulatory framework around communication on the topic.\n\nIn summary, while the government's actions, through the AEC, align with progressive values in seeking to protect democratic integrity, ensure transparency in political communication, and combat harmful speech, the profound reliance on opaque, for-profit corporate entities to achieve these goals represents a significant deviation. This dependency raises concerns about corporate influence, the ultimate accountability of content moderation decisions, and the potential for a chilling effect on civil liberties, highlighting a need for stronger public governance and oversight of digital information spaces."

We’ve been involved in more than 200 elections around the world since 2017, and we’ve\nlearned key lessons from each one about where to focus our teams, technologies, and investments so\nthey will have the greatest impact. Here are some of the ways that we’re already promoting safety and\nintegrity across our platforms ahead of this year’s Australian Election.\n\nCombating Abuse, Misinformation, and Election Interference Using a Comprehensive Approach\n\nWe’ve made significant investments in safety and security, including approximately $5 billion/ $AU7\nbillion in 2021 alone and now have more than 40,000 people around the world working on safety and\nsecurity. These investments have allowed us to build our ability to reduce the likelihood of abuses -\nincluding election interference, misinformation and online harms - from happening in the first place,\nrather than just addressing them when they occur. For this year’s Australian election, this work will\ninclude:\n\n● Announcing a new Australian Fact-Checker. We know the importance of ensuring Australians\nhave access to reliable information about the election in Australia. Therefore, we are pleased to\nannounce the expansion of our third party fact checking program in Australia today. From March\n21, RMIT FactLab will join Meta’s global independent fact checking program in reviewing and\nrating the accuracy of content in the lead up to the 2022 Australian Election, alongside Agence\nFrance Presse and the Australian Associated Press. We'll also be providing one-off grants to all\nour fact-checkers to increase their capacity in the lead up to the election. Our fact checkers work\nto reduce the spread of misinformation across Meta’s services. When they rate something as\n\nReleased under the FOI ActReleased under the FOI Act\n\n\n--- Page 2 ---\n\nfalse, we significantly reduce its distribution so fewer people see it. We also notify people who\ntry to share something rated as false and add a warning label with a link to a debunking article.\n● Russell Skelton, Director of RMIT FactLab said, “We see this as a really important public service.\nIf we can play a role in preventing the dissemination of misinformation on social media that has\nthe potential to mislead or harm, then we see that as providing a really critical service.”\n\n● We are also working with expert organisations such as First Draft to increase monitoring for\nmisinformation in the lead-up to the election and publish related analyses and reporting on their\nwebsite. First Draft will also be providing pre-election training for Australian journalists on how\nto identify and prevent amplifying mis and dis information.\n\n● Empowering People to Identify False News. Since we know it’s not enough to just limit or\n\nremove harmful or misleading electoral misinformation that people see, we’re giving people\nmore context about a post so they can make an informed decision on what to read, trust and\nshare. We have invested in dedicated Australian initiatives including:\n\n○ Working with the Australian Associated Press to launch an education and awareness\ncampaign comprising a series of short videos modelling how people can recognise and\navoid misinformation by taking simple steps to 'Check the Facts'. The campaign will run\nagain this April and will include, for the first time, content translated in three other\nlanguages - Vietnamese, Simplified Chinese and Arabic to extend the benefits of the\ncampaign even further.\n\n○ Partnering with First Draft to develop the “Don’t be a Misinfluencer” campaign on\n\nFacebook and Instagram to help creators and influencers to share tips for spotting false\nnews.\n\nSecurity and election interference\n\n● Combatting Influence Operations. We have specialised global teams to identify and take action\nagainst threats to the election, including signs of coordinated inauthentic behaviour across our\napps. We are also coordinating with the Government's election integrity assurance taskforce and\nsecurity agencies in the lead up to the election. We’ve also improved our AI so that we can more\neffectively detect and block fake accounts, which are often behind this activity.\n\n○ Since 2017, we have removed over 150 networks around the world including ahead of\nmajor democratic elections. We’re working to find and remove any networks of\nCoordinated Inauthentic Behaviour. We’ll also share publicly what we find.\n● Protecting candidates and leaders running in the Australian election. In December 2021, we\nextended our Facebook Protect security program to Australia. The program has been rolled out\nto those who might be at a higher risk of being targeted online, such as candidates and public\nofficials, encouraging them to adopt stronger account security protections. We will also be\nrunning a Facebook security prompt to candidates and leaders to remind them to turn on two\nfactor authentication. We are working with the Australian Electoral Commission and political\nparties to run training sessions for all candidates on our policies and tools and how to keep safe\nin the lead up to the election.\n\nReleased under the FOI ActReleased under the FOI Act\n\n\n--- Page 3 ---\n\nEncouraging transparency around political, election and social issues ads\n\n● Mandatory transparency for political ads. Since the 2019 Australian Federal Election, we’ve\nmade a series of changes for advertisers in Australia that want to run electoral, political and\nsocial issue ads. Advertisers are now required to go through an authorisation process using\ngovernment-issued photo ID, and place a “Paid for by” disclaimers on their ads. This includes any\nperson creating, modifying, publishing or pausing ads that reference political figures, political\nparties or elections. It also includes social issue ads that seek to influence public opinion through\ndiscussion, debate or advocacy for or against important topics, such as civil and social rights,\ncrime, environmental politics, education or immigration. We launched these requirements for\nsocial issue ads last year, before the first possible election date, to ensure it was in place for the\nAustralian federal election. Any political, electoral or social issue ads on Facebook and Instagram\nthat do not have the correct authorisation or disclaimers will be removed from the platform and\narchived in a public Ad Library for seven years.\n\n● Allowing Australians to control their experience. While political and social issue ads play an\nimportant role in every election, people have told us they want the option to see fewer of them\nin their Facebook and Instagram feeds. Last year, we announced a new feature that gives people\nmore control by giving them the  choice to see fewer social issues, electoral, and political ads.\n\nEncouraging civic engagement and empowering voters\n\nWe want to do more than just prevent abuse on our platforms during elections. We also want to\nempower people to participate, so for this year’s Australian elections, we’re supporting civic engagement\nin a number of ways.\n\n● Developing products on the platform to encourage people to vote. Closer to election day we\nwill begin running notifications at the top of Facebook’s Feed for people over 18, reminding\nthem to vote, while also connecting them with reliable information about the voting process. We\nwill also be launching Instagram Stories elections stickers to celebrate and encourage voter\nengagement.\n\nReleased under the FOI ActReleased under the FOI Act\n\n\n--- Page 4 ---\n\nElection Day Reminder (example only)\n\n● Informing people about the latest election communications from political parties, journalists\nand the Australian Election Commission. We will release a public, Live Display on Crowdtangle\ndedicated to the Australian Election. The Live Display will provide real-time coverage of the most\nrecent communications about the election on Facebook and Instagram.\n\nAs we get closer to the Australian election, we’ll stay vigilant to emerging threats and take additional\nsteps if necessary to prevent abuse on our platform while also empowering people in Australia to use\ntheir voice by voting.\n\n++++\n\nAbout RMIT\n\nReleased under the FOI ActReleased under the FOI Act\n\n\n--- Page 5 ---\n\nRMIT FactLab is a research hub at RMIT University dedicated to debunking misinformation online and\ndeveloping critical awareness about its origins and spread.
