This service, an expansion of existing provisions, is a last-resort option for those unable to vote in person or via postal vote.\n\n**Relevance to FOI Request LEX2846:**\nThe document directly describes the implementation and operational details of the **Commonwealth Electoral (COVID Enfranchisement) Regulations 2022**, outlining the secure telephone voting system. It acknowledges potential **logistical challenges** through anticipated \"long wait times\" and the need to adapt the service for scale, aligning with the FOI's mention of projected cost increases and staffing difficulties. The document heavily emphasizes the **integrity of new voting methods**, detailing a two-step process for voter anonymity and vote secrecy, adherence to ballot paper security, a Quality Assurance framework, mandatory staff political neutrality, robust electoral roll checks to prevent double voting, and the provision for scrutineer observation. It also highlights the AEC's commitment to **privacy** by adhering to the Privacy Act and Australian Privacy Principles, with systems undergoing independent security and privacy impact assessments."

  "prompt": "Considering this document as part of an FOI request, summarize the document and its relevance to the FOI request in markdown format. Provide only the markdown formatted summary text. Do not include any conversational filler or preamble.To aid you, the overview of the FOI request is: [REQUEST OVERVIEW START] The FOI request LEX2846 illuminated the Australian Electoral Commission's (AEC) extensive preparations for conducting federal elections amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. Released documents detailed the **Commonwealth Electoral (COVID Enfranchisement) Regulations 2022**, establishing a secure telephone voting system for eligible self-isolating voters diagnosed close to polling day, supported by detailed \"Customer Journey\" plans and staff scripts. The AEC also adapted its **postal voting policy** for COVID-positive individuals and noted reduced mobile polling. Revealed were significant **logistical and financial challenges**, including projected cost increases and staffing difficulties, prompting the AEC to seek greater legislative flexibility for emergency election management. The AEC ensured **COVID-safe measures** at polling places and maintained the integrity of new voting methods through staff neutrality, scrutineer observation, and robust complaint mechanisms.\n [REQUEST OVERVIEW END] \n\n--- MAIN DOCUMENT TEXT START ---\n\n\n\n--- Page 1 ---\n\nKEY MESSAGING \n2022 federal election telephone voting system \nLast updated 28 March 2022 – will be updated progressively as more details are confirmed \n\nAbout the telephone voting service \n\n•  We know that some people will be in isolation or quarantine under a public health order during \n\nthe election and will not be able to vote in person. \n\n•  People can check if they are eligible to vote early if they don’t think they can make it to a \n\npolling place on election day. Eligible people can: \n\no  vote at one of our early voting centres, or  \no  apply for a postal vote by visiting aec.gov.au. Postal voting applications close at 6pm the \n\nWednesday before election day. \n\n•  The AEC may establish a telephone voting service if it’s required, after applications for postal \n\nvoting close for people who are unable to vote in person due to COVID-19. \n\nWho can use the service \n\n•  People directed to isolate or quarantine under a public health order may be eligible to register to \nvote by phone after 6pm the Wednesday before election day up until 2pm (TBC) on election day. \n\no  This expanded telephone voting service is an emergency measure for the 2022 federal \n\nelection. \n\no  Voters accessing the telephone voting service should be prepared for potentially long wait \n\ntimes.  \n\no  Voters will need to make a declaration and provide evidence of their eligibility for \n\ntelephone voting due to COVID-19. \n\no  Exact eligibility criteria for the service will be made available soon.  \n\nSafety and privacy  \n\n• \n\nIntegrity is a core AEC value ingrained into all aspects of our operation. The telephone voting \nservice is no different. Personal details are only used to register as an eligible voter.  Our voter \nregistration systems are designed to protect personal details and have been independently \nassessed for security compliance. \n\n•  Telephone voting will involve a two-step process to ensure anonymity of voters and the secrecy \n\nof the vote.  \n\no  Voters will register, provide a PIN and receive a voting registration number. This will de-\n\nidentify the voter and ensure confidentiality of votes.  \n\no  Voters then call the telephone service to vote. \no  Voters must provide the PIN and registration number before they can vote. Votes remain \nsecret because the AEC voting assistant will not know the voter’s name and address.\n\n\n--- Page 2 ---\n\nBallot paper security \n\n•  The AEC’s Ballot Paper Principles apply, and ballot paper security arrangements will be consistent \n\nwith other polling places. \n\n•  A Quality Assurance framework will be in place to ensure procedural integrity. \n\n•  All call centre staff will have to declare political neutrality. \n\n•  The AEC systems used for registration have had all appropriate cyber security assessments. \n\n•  The electoral roll is checked for instances of prior voting in the election when they register and \n\nagain when they call to vote. No-one will be able to cast a vote by telephone if they have already \nbeen marked as voting. \n\nAEC experience in telephone voting \n\n•  Telephone voting is a service that the AEC has operated previously for Australian voters who are \n\nblind or have low vision. \n\n•  The telephone voting service for COVID-affected electors is based on these existing services and \n\nhas been adapted for scale and eligibility requirements. \n\n•  The telephone voting service for voters who are blind or have low vision and voters in Antarctica \nwill operate separately and will not be affected by the expanded service for voters affected by \nCOVID-19. \n\nScrutineering and the telephone voting service \n\n•  A process will be available for scrutineers.  \n\n•  Scrutineering is a fundamental part of the delivery of Australian federal elections. This is being \nplanned as part of the scaling up of the telephone voting service for this once-in-a-generation \npandemic federal election.  \n\nMore information \n\n•  More information will be made available to eligible people ahead of the telephone voting period. \n\n• \n\nInformation on other ways to vote are at aec.gov.au\n\n\n--- Page 3 ---\n\nQUESTIONS AND ANSWERS \n\nIs this a form of online voting? \n\nNo. Legislation does not currently allow for any form of online voting. The only part of this process to \ntake place online is a registration option. Each vote call results in a physical ballot paper being filled \nin and counted in the same way as all other ballot papers. \n\nWhat’s the process to ensure the vote is taken correctly by the call centre operators? \n\nThe call centre operator reads back the preferences to the voter once finished, and voters can \nrequest for a different operator to do this. All operators will be required to declare political \nneutrality. \n\nWhat if the call wait times are longer than people are willing to wait? \n\nVoting is compulsory, however voters with a valid and sufficient reason for not voting will not be \nfined. Voters in this situation can tell us why they cannot vote via email (TBC). \n\nVoters in the telephone queue at 6pm local time will still be able to cast their vote, similar to the \nqueue at in person polling places. \n\nHow is the AEC ensuring my COVID-19 information is protected? \n\nVoters’ COVID-19 health information is needed to determine eligibility for telephone voting under \nthe relevant laws including the Electoral Legislation Amendment (COVID Enfranchisement) Bill 2022. \n\nThe AEC adheres to the Privacy Act and Australian Privacy Principles to ensure personal information \nis protected. This includes the conduct of a third-party privacy impact assessment.\n\n"
