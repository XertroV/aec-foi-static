            "text": "## Document Summary\n\nThis two-page document, titled \"2023 CENSUS ACTION PLAN,\" originates from the Australian Electoral Commission's (AEC) SDFB branch. It serves as an internal framework outlining key initiatives and improvements intended for the 2023 Census period. The plan identifies priority areas, specific actions to be taken, timeframes for completion, responsible parties, and anticipated impacts.\n\nKey initiatives detailed include:\n\n*   **Team Building:** Developing a plan by December 2023 for short staff secondments across the branch, with placements occurring from January to June 2023. The aim is to foster better relationships, understanding of work pressures, and resource flexibility.\n*   **Strategic Thinking:** Implementing a monthly strategic thinking activity starting June 2023 to provide staff with dedicated time and space for strategic foresight and planning, connecting their work to the agency and broader government.\n*   **Understanding Agency Functions:** Inviting guest speakers from relevant stakeholder areas to present at section or branch meetings from June 2023 to enhance understanding of agency functions, roles, and responsibilities.\n*   **Communication:** Improving internal communication by inviting specific roles (AC and BPO) to section meetings, an ongoing activity from June 2023.\n\nWhile \"Wellbeing\" is identified as a priority \"CENSUS AREA ACTION\" in the document, a specific corresponding action is not detailed within the structured table format, unlike the other listed areas. All actions are the responsibility of 'Directors and AC'. Progress for these initiatives is to be discussed at monthly branch meetings and updated on \"Census Action Plan posters\" in each section.\n\n## Relevance to FOI Request\n\nThis document is highly relevant to the FOI request as it directly addresses the sought-after internal action plans of the AEC for the 2023 Census. It specifically provides documentation on the AEC's approach to key areas highlighted in the request:\n\n*   **Team Development:** Through the detailed staff secondment plan, aiming for improved knowledge and engagement across the branch.\n*   **Strategic Planning:** Via dedicated strategic thinking activities and efforts to enhance understanding of agency functions through guest speakers.\n*   **Internal Communication:** By outlining the practice of inviting specific roles (AC and BPO) to section meetings.\n\nThe document aligns with the FOI request's overview regarding its origin (AEC's SDFB branch), the timeframe of the initiatives, the identification of key actions, the responsible parties ('Directors and AC'), and the specified methods for progress tracking (monthly branch meetings and updated posters). The only nuance is that while \"staff wellbeing\" was a focus of the FOI request and \"Wellbeing\" is listed as a priority area in the document, a specific action to address it is not detailed within the document's structured action plan."

FYI the overview of the FOI request is: The FOI request sought documentation on the Australian Electoral Commission's (AEC) internal action plans for the 2023 Census, specifically focusing on team development, staff wellbeing, strategic planning, and internal communication.
