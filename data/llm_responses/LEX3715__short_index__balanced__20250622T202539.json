Main Content from Released FOI Request Documents\n\nThe released (edited or full) documents provide insights into various operational and financial aspects of the AEC, particularly concerning the 2022 Federal Election and preparedness for future electoral events, including a potential referendum:\n\n*   **Document No. 22: Referendum: Funding arrangements for referendums**\n    *   Funding for referendums and associated YES/NO campaigns is provided via government appropriation. The October 2022-23 Budget included $75.1 million over two years for preparatory work for a First Nations Voice to Parliament Referendum, with specific allocations for AEC preparations ($50.2 million) and increasing First Nations enrolment/participation ($16.1 million). An additional $160 million is provisioned in the Contingency Reserve.\n*   **Document No. 24: Financial matters**\n    *   Highlights ongoing challenges with the AEC's funding model, noting a $24.5 million loss in 2021-22 (compared to a $47.9 million surplus in 2020-21). The AEC's operating results can fluctuate significantly due to external factors impacting expenditure timing, posing risks for managing complex electoral events and electoral roll growth.\n*   **Document No. 25: Vendors, Procurements and Major Tenders**\n    *   The AEC undertakes extensive preparation and planning for procurements and tenders for federal electoral events, adhering to Commonwealth Procurement Rules (CPRs). A specific \"Referendum Procurement Plan\" is in place for a potential 2023 referendum, tracking critical procurements and contracts.\n*   **Document No. 26: Performance Statements**\n    *   The AEC's 2021-22 Annual Performance Statements indicate that 74% (14 of 19) of performance measures were met, 5% (1 of 19) were \"on track to be met,\" and 21% (4 of 19) were \"partly met\" (e.g., voter turnout, staff training completion). No measures were rated \"not met.\"\n*   **Document No. 27: Travel**\n    *   Total travel expenditure increased significantly to $5.393 million in 2021-22 (from $1.579 million in 2020-21 and $1.699 million in 2019-20), primarily due to the 2022 federal election. The AEC adheres to the Whole of Australian Government Travel Policy.\n*   **Document No. 28.2: Indigenous voter services and engagement**\n    *   The AEC is committed to increasing First Nations electoral participation. The estimated national Indigenous enrolment rate reached 84.5% as of December 2022, a consistent increase from 74.7% in June 2017. Efforts include successful direct enrolment trials (adding ~15,500 First Nations people), targeted advertising campaigns, and the Indigenous Electoral Participation Program (partnerships, remote enrolment, culturally appropriate services). The AEC is also expanding remote polling services.\n*   **Document No. 36.2: Referendum Preparedness**\n    *   The AEC, as an independent statutory authority, is responsible solely for the \"machinery\" of a referendum (not the campaigns). With appropriate lead time and funding, the AEC is ready to conduct a referendum, with costs estimated to be similar to a federal election (e.g., the 2022 federal election was budgeted at approximately $420 million).\n*   **Document No. 37.2: COVID safety measures – 2022 FE**\n    *   The AEC safely delivered the 2022 federal election with COVID-19 safety measures in place, adapting to the changing environment without a reported spike in cases attributable to the election. Planning adhered to existing legislation (which does not allow for 100% postal or electronic voting), with additional staff, vaccination requirements, and mask mandates for election workers.\n*   **Document No. 38: Early Voting**\n    *   Early voting continues to rise, with over 7.9 million early votes cast in the 2022 federal election (51.34% of total votes), up from 6.15 million (40.79%) in 2019. In-person early voting accounted for over 36% of all votes. Postal votes significantly increased to 2.39 million (from 1.29 million in 2019). Mobile polling services were reduced due to the pandemic.\n*   **Document No. 39: Postal Voting**\n    *   The AEC expresses confidence in the integrity of postal voting processes, which are governed by the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918. Legislative changes in 2021 modernized postal voting envelopes and allowed for the early extraction of ballot papers from declaration envelopes (from the Monday prior to election day) to speed up counting. In 2022, the AEC issued 2.73 million postal votes (an 87% return rate), with 79.2% of rejected postal votes due to missing elector or witness signatures.\n*   **Document No. 40: Mobile Polling – 2022 Federal Election**\n    *   Mobile polling services were provided to remote areas, homeless shelters, a limited number of residential aged care facilities (RACFs), and some prisons. The decision to limit services to RACFs was based on health advice and risk assessments, requiring explicit agreement from facilities and adherence to strict COVID-19 safety measures.\n*   **Document No. 43.2: Overseas voting – 2022 Federal Election**\n    *   COVID-19 and security concerns necessitated adjustments to overseas voting for the 2022 federal election. In-person voting was available at 19 overseas posts, while others relied on postal voting, supported by courier delivery to improve speed and reliability, and diplomatic mail for returns.\n*   **Document No. 44.2: Senate counting and assurance**\n    *   The AEC uses ballot paper scanning to capture Senate preferences for timely scrutiny. In the 2022 federal election, over 108 million preferences from more than 15.5 million ballot papers were scanned, data-entered, and verified in approximately four weeks. The process involves human verification, robust controls, and security assessments (including IRAP). An external company performs legislated on-site assurance (0.45% exception rate in 2022). Scrutineers can observe the process. The AEC confirmed it has not used Scytl software for any federal election.\n*   **Document No. 45: EasyCount – Senate**\n    *   \"EasyCount – Senate\" (ECS) is the AEC's software for distributing preferences in Senate elections. It is rigorously tested, secure, and enables reporting and auditing of results. New legislation will require an external assessor to verify ECS accuracy before the next federal election. The source code is not publicly released due to its commercial use for other elections.\n*   **Document No. 46: Polling Place Technology – ECLs**\n    *   Investment in polling place technology will increase the number of Electronic Certified Lists (ECLs) from 5,500 (used in 2022) to 10,000 for the next federal election. A new digital tool for polling place Officers in Charge is also being developed to enhance polling place management, integrate with the AEC Command Centre, and improve issue resolution, replacing current paper-based returns.\n*   **Document No. 47: Voter verification**\n    *   The AEC states that voter verification (requiring identification when casting a vote) is a matter for Parliament and would necessitate legislative change. The AEC warns of potential operational impacts, including increased queue times, higher costs for technology, materials, training, and staff, more time-consuming declaration votes, and the risk of disenfranchising eligible voters.\n*   **Document No. 48: Candidate qualification checklist**\n    *   The AEC is required to check that mandatory questions on the self-assessment qualification checklist are answered by candidates but does not determine the accuracy of the answers or candidates' eligibility, as this is a matter for the High Court. For the 2022 federal election, 1,624 checklists (totalling 17,117 pages) were published soon after nominations were declared.\n*   **Document No. 49: Commonwealth Procurement Rules – Environmental sustainability**\n    *   The AEC procures goods and services in line with Commonwealth Procurement Rules, which now explicitly require considering climate change impacts in value-for-money assessments. The AEC's practices include evaluating suppliers' environmental credentials, using recycled content, and recycling/donating end-of-life products. The document notes the challenge of measuring specific climate impacts for small items and balancing this with operational demands.\n*   **Document No. 50: Cowper Count – 2022 Federal Election**\n    *   An administrative error occurred in the Cowper counting centre during the 2022 federal election, where some House of Representatives ballot papers were inadvertently combined across different pre-poll voting centre counts. The AEC confirmed this error did not impact the overall election results for the division and that all ballot papers were accounted for.\n*   **Document No. 51: Call Centre worker recordings**\n    *   Addresses social media allegations that AEC call centre staff provided false voting information during the election. The AEC stated it could not verify the authenticity of such isolated claims without reviewing hundreds of thousands of enquiries and asserted that its 105,000 temporary staff are trained and provided with accurate scripts.\n*   **Document No. 61: Referendums: YES/NO pamphlet and information campaigns**\n    *   No substantive content was provided in the released pages for this document.\n*   **Document No. 62: Election time public information campaign**\n    *   The AEC conducted a large-scale, multi-channel communication campaign for the 2022 federal election (with a $19 million media placement spend). The campaign aimed to inform and encourage voter participation, covering enrolment deadlines, early voting options, and how to correctly complete ballot papers. It also included \"Stop and Consider\" messaging against disinformation and information on COVID-19 safety measures, with content translated into 52 languages.\n*   **Document No. 68: Gilmore Count**\n    *   The AEC denied requests for a recount in the division of Gilmore following the 2022 federal election, made by the Liberal Party candidate. The Divisional Returning Officer and the Electoral Commissioner concluded that the scrutiny process was properly conducted and the margin of 373 votes did not warrant a recount, consistent with AEC policy (automatic recounts occur for margins less than 100 votes). No request was made to the Court of Disputed Returns.\n*   **Document No. 69: 2GB Discarded ballot papers found – Port Macquarie**\n    *   The AEC is investigating reports of discarded completed ballot papers found in a bin in Port Macquarie. Initial findings suggest these were likely declaration ballot papers that were not returned correctly by voters. The small number of papers indicates no impact on the election result, and no evidence points to an operational issue by the AEC.\n\nProvide only the markdown formatted summary text.
