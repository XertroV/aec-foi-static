These codes categorize redacted material into extensive personal information (including name, date of birth, citizenship, address, signature, political opinions, and financial details), various types of business information (such as bank/billing accounts, trade secrets, and commercially valuable data), and other FOI exemptions. The latter include legal professional communication, deliberative material, electoral roll material, and information pertaining to the proper and efficient conduct of the Australian Electoral Commission's operations.\n\nThis document is directly relevant to FOI request LEX2088 as it serves as the detailed explanation for the heavy redactions applied to the requested PDF copies of the five formally declared Federal Election 2022 candidate nomination forms (AECEF060, AEC060-a, and AEC060-b) for the division of Cook. It clarifies the specific exemptions under the FOI Act 1982 that necessitated the withholding of personal, business, and other sensitive information from these documents."
