  "prompt": "From a government skeptic's viewpoint, provide a concise, single-paragraph summary in markdown format of the following FOI request overview:\n\nSummary:\n\nThe provided FOI documents illustrate a superficial commitment to transparency, offering a list of \"Postal Vote CSV file for upload\" entries spanning nearly three weeks without providing any insight into their content, purpose, or the underlying processes. While all 21 entries are marked \"Released in full\" with no exemptions, this \"release\" pertains solely to the metadata of these files, not the actual data concerning postal votes themselves.\n\nThis approach demonstrates several concerning aspects:\n*   **Illusory Transparency**: The government presents a formalistic record of file existence, allowing it to claim compliance with FOI requests while simultaneously withholding any substantive information about politically sensitive election data. This is transparency in name only, obscuring critical details from public scrutiny.\n*   **Bureaucratic Obfuscation**: The sheer volume of daily entries (21 distinct \"uploads\" listed) suggests either an inefficient, highly granular data management system, or a deliberate fragmentation of information that makes comprehensive oversight difficult. The FOI response itself becomes a bureaucratic artifact rather than a source of actionable information.\n*   **Lack of Accountability**: Without access to the actual CSV file contents, the public remains unable to scrutinize the integrity of postal vote processing, identify potential data vulnerabilities, or verify the efficiency and security of election administration. The government confirms daily data transfers without offering any means of independent verification or oversight.\n*   **Questionable Value of \"Release\"**: The absence of any exemptions for these metadata entries further underscores the trivial nature of the \"information\" released. It suggests the government found no reason to withhold the *titles* of its files, while the sensitive *contents* remain undisclosed, perpetuating a cycle where FOI requests yield minimal actionable intelligence for skeptics concerned with government power and waste.\n\nProvide only the markdown formatted summary text. Do not include any conversational filler or preamble."
