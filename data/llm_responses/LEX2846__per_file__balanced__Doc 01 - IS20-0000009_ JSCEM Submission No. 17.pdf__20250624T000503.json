            "text": "This document is the Australian Electoral Commission's (AEC) November 2020 submission to the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters, detailing its response to and proposals for conducting elections during emergencies, particularly the COVID-19 pandemic. It draws heavily on experiences from the Eden-Monaro by-election.\n\n**Relevance to FOI Request LEX2846:**\n\n*   **AEC's Extensive Preparations for COVID-19 Elections:** The submission outlines the AEC's agility in adapting to the pandemic, including operational changes and proposed legislative reforms for future federal elections. It highlights efforts to maintain electoral integrity and public confidence amidst health risks.\n*   **Commonwealth Electoral (COVID Enfranchisement) Regulations 2022 & Legislative Flexibility:** The document explicitly proposes legislative amendments to the *Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918*, seeking greater flexibility for the Electoral Commissioner. This includes authority to modify electoral processes (e.g., reasons for postal/pre-poll, sole postal voting, streamlining applications), extend operating hours, and safely conduct scrutiny during emergencies. It also seeks power to adjourn or suspend polling and other electoral events, which directly supports the rationale for regulations like the COVID Enfranchisement Regulations.\n*   **Secure Telephone Voting System:** The AEC notes the existing telephone voting option for blind/low vision voters and proposes expanding the categories of electors eligible for electronic (telephone) voting during emergencies. For Eden-Monaro, it explicitly facilitated telephone voting for those blind or with low vision.\n*   **\"Customer Journey\" Plans & Staff Scripts:** The document details extensive consultation with Commonwealth and state health authorities, police, and other agencies to develop and implement COVID-safe measures. It describes the rapid development of new, mandatory online training modules and videos for polling officials on hygiene, PPE use, and queue management, reflecting detailed operational planning and staff instruction. Communication campaigns focused on \"Plan your vote\" and COVID-19 safety, aiming to reduce voter anxiety.\n*   **Postal Voting Policy Adaptation:** The Eden-Monaro by-election saw a significant increase in postal votes. The AEC actively facilitated postal voting for vulnerable groups like aged care residents and hospital patients as an alternative to in-person mobile polling, and proposes streamlining postal voting applications for broader use in emergencies.\n*   **Reduced Mobile Polling:** For the Eden-Monaro by-election, the AEC explicitly decided *not* to conduct traditional mobile polling services for aged care facilities and hospitals, instead establishing a dedicated team to facilitate postal voting for these groups based on medical advice.\n*   **Logistical and Financial Challenges:** The submission directly addresses these, reporting that COVID-19 prevention measures almost doubled the cost of the Eden-Monaro by-election ($3.954 million vs. average $2 million). It projects substantial cost increases for a federal election (e.g., estimated $13 million for additional polling staff, over $30 million for PPE procurement). Logistical challenges include recruitment difficulties (estimated 30% more polling staff needed), supply chain risks for PPE, and constraints on venue availability.\n*   **COVID-Safe Measures at Polling Places:** The attached Eden-Monaro Service Plan details comprehensive measures, including social distancing, hand sanitiser at entrances and issuing points, queue controllers, \"sneeze shields,\" regular sanitisation of surfaces/equipment, single-use pencils, and staff use of masks.\n*   **Integrity of New Voting Methods:** The document addresses integrity by detailing how COVID-safe measures would be implemented for counting processes (social distancing, PPE, sanitisation) while accommodating scrutineers. It highlights challenges in balancing social distancing with scrutineer entitlements, underscoring the need for robust mechanisms in adapted processes."

There are currently over 16 million Australians \nenrolled to vote, and the federal election dates are not known in advance. Once the writs are \nissued, the AEC mobilises to identify suitable polling staff, venues, and all supporting \nlogistical arrangements to administer the event.  \n\nEmergency situations are inherently difficult to predict and are typically associated with high \nlevels of uncertainty about either their cause or the scope and severity of their impacts.  An \nemergency situation has the potential to affect more than one jurisdiction, impact the \ncommunity, and create pressure for resources when there is competing demand.  \n\nThe Australian federal electoral system may be vulnerable to emergency situations in \ncircumstances where key components of the election are disrupted, including voting, election \nadministration and campaigning. The timing and location of an emergency situation will \ninfluence the required adjustments to administration and the mitigation strategies which are \nused.  \n\nThere are a number of key limitations in the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 (Electoral \nAct) that could constrain the AEC’s ability to respond to circumstances requiring suspension \nor disruption to components of election delivery, including at polling places.  \n\nThis submission highlights requirements for Parliament’s consideration that would assist the \nAEC in continuing to deliver high integrity federal elections through various emergency \nscenarios at the national, state, or regional level.  \n\nTo this end, the AEC considers the following amendments to legislation are advisable in \norder to provide the AEC with greater flexibility to respond to emergency situations: \n\n  Enabling the Electoral Commissioner to determine how certain electoral processes \nand activities may be undertaken, where these processes or activities are impacted \nby an emergency situation \n\n  Providing the Electoral Commissioner with the authority to make a decision to \n\nadjourn or suspend polling, or provide for the temporary suspension or adjournment \nof other events. \n\nPage 2\n\n\n--- Page 4 ---\n\nAdministering elections in \nemergency situations  \n\nBuilding confidence and trust in elections is as complex as it has ever been. The AEC is \ncommitted to ensuring Australia’s elections are conducted in a manner that inspires and \nsustains confidence of the public, and election stakeholders.  \n\nAn enduring challenge in the electoral environment during ordinary times is maintaining a \nmutual understanding amongst electoral stakeholders of the shared responsibilities and \naccountabilities in a number of areas, including maintaining voters’ trust in elections and \nensuring proactive actions are being taken to meet reasonable expectations around flexibility \nand responsiveness while providing for electoral integrity. \n\nElection planning and delivery in an emergency situation involves new stakeholders with \ntheir own remits and additional complexities. A more flexible legislative framework would \nprovide the AEC with greater flexibility to respond to emergencies and their impact on the \npublic and election stakeholders. \n\nThe complex environment  \n\nExternal guidance \n\nMost emergency situations will involve a declaration under Commonwealth, state or territory \nlaw. Those charged with managing an emergency situation and its consequences have \npressing priorities related to their respective remits around preservation and protection of \nlife, health, property and essential services. \n\nDuring any emergency situation, the AEC is only one stakeholder in a complex environment. \nManagement of an election during an emergency situation requires engagement with \nministers and senior officials across governments as well as advisory bodies. The specific \nstakeholders and their respective roles and responsibilities are dependent on the nature and \nseverity of the emergency situation, and can evolve as the situation changes.  \n\nA challenge with delivering a federal electoral event in a state or territory with a declared \nemergency will be conducting the event consistently with state or territory emergency \nrequirements. While the constitutional position is that a state or territory law should not \nprevent a Commonwealth agency or a person from carrying out their responsibilities under \nCommonwealth law, it will nevertheless be important to work with local authorities to ensure \nelectoral events are conducted consistently with local emergency requirements so that \nelectors, staff and others in an election are not put at risk.  \n\nA critical feature of the successful delivery of the Eden-Monaro by-election in the COVID-19 \nenvironment was the significant investment of time required, and the immense value \nobtained, from engaging with government departments across jurisdictions before and \n\nPage 3\n\n\n--- Page 5 ---\n\nduring the by-election. In delivering the by-election the AEC liaised closely with the \nCommonwealth Chief Medical Officer and the NSW Department of Health, emergency \nservices, the Electoral Integrity Assurance Taskforce and political participants. A similar \nmodel of consultation is in train for the Groom by-election.  \n\nThe AEC’s emergency situation response requires a streamlined approach to access key \nstakeholders, such as police, fire and emergency services, Chief Medical Officers, Defence \nand central security agencies. \n\nKey logistical challenges \n\nEmergencies can pose major logistical difficulties that could force significant compromises, \ndelays, or even render an election partially or fully undeliverable.  \n\nStaffing: The delivery of elections is reliant on huge temporary workforces who in an \nemergency situation may be less available. At a federal election the AEC relies on a \ntemporary workforce of approximately 90,000 people. Recruitment of temporary workers is \nincreasingly challenging in normal circumstances and an emergency situation could \nsuddenly pose significant recruitment and absenteeism challenges that could threaten the \ndelivery of the election. This is amplified in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic where \nadditional staff will be required to perform hygiene and sanitisation duties, manage queues \nand maintain voting service levels. \n\nMaterials and logistics: Supply chains are also likely to be affected depending on the scale \nof the emergency. The rapid outbreak of COVID-19 resulted in global shortages of personal \nprotective equipment (PPE) and lockdowns affected the transportation industry resulting in \nthe slower delivery of food and other supplies. In these circumstances, the supply of \nessential items for an election could become difficult or unattainable.   \n\nTurnout: Limitations on the movement and concentration of electors together with the risks \nof casualties during an emergency situation (for example, a natural disaster) can impact \nvoter turnout at an election and the legitimacy of the result. \n\nPremises: An election relies on the availability, at short notice, of thousands of premises to \nconduct voting and for counting centres. An emergency situation may reduce the availability \nor suitability of premises or reduce the willingness of venue owners to hire to the AEC.   \n\nService suppliers: The AEC partners with external service providers to facilitate aspects of \nthe election. Any impact to these major suppliers would have significant flow-on effects to \nthe running of an election event – for example in the preparation and dispatch of postal \nvotes, scanning and data capture of Senate ballot papers, printing of ballot papers, \npreparation of paper and electronic certified lists, etcetera. \n\nExacerbated existing challenges: Conducting an electoral event during an emergency \nsituation will exacerbate existing election delivery challenges including: \n\n  access to electoral services by electors: \n\no  with disability \no \no \n\nliving or travelling overseas \nlocated in regional and remote areas \n\nPage 4\n\n\n--- Page 6 ---\n\no  experiencing homelessness \n\n \n\n \n\nthe impacts of increasing number of electors voting early \n\nreliability and timeliness of postal services \n\n  provision of services to electors in Indigenous communities. \n\nArrangements for a federal election commence immediately following the previous one, with \napproach and policy decisions required early in order to implement required contracts, \nmaterials and plans in advance of the earliest possible election date. Changes to an election \ndelivery model will be shaped by election delivery options at that time.  \n\nBusiness Continuity \nThe AEC already has planned contingencies in place that position it to respond to significant \nbusiness disruption during the election period as part of its business continuity planning \narrangements. \n\nProposals that allow for greater flexibility in the way in which the AEC might respond to \nemergency situations will strengthen the AEC’s ability to effectively respond to and mitigate \nbusiness disruptions caused by such emergencies. \n\nPage 5\n\n\n--- Page 7 ---\n\nProposed areas of legislation for \nconsideration of amendment   \n\nThe prescriptive nature of the Electoral Act provides limited flexibility for how an election can \nbe conducted. For example, the Electoral Act provides few exceptions to the requirement for \nphysical attendance when voting, and those exceptions (for example, postal or telephone \nvoting) may not be available to all or scalable in an emergency situation.  \n\nTemporary modification \n\nTo provide greater flexibility in the event of an emergency situation, the Electoral Act could \nbe modified, for example, to: \n\n  extend the reasons electors can postal or pre-poll vote \n\n  conduct an election solely by postal vote (in some or all geographic areas) \n\n  streamline application and/or declaration requirements for postal voting and pre-poll \n\nvoting \n\n  expand categories of electors who may utilise the electronic (telephone) voting \n\nmethod \n\n  extend operating or polling hours, and/or \n\n  conduct scrutiny more safely.  \n\nAny modifications to the Electoral Act would only be possible for federal electoral events \nconducted in a state or territory or a geographic area of Australia where there is a declared \nemergency.    \n\nGiven the timeframes prescribed in the Electoral Act for conducting federal electoral events \n(from as little as 33 days), it is recommend that the authority to make emergency \nmodifications:  \n\n  may be exercised when there is a local or national emergency situation declared (or \n\nother public direction or determination made by a Minister in relation to an \nemergency’s effects on an election) under Commonwealth, state or territory law  \n\n \n\n \n\nis limited to the extent necessary to conduct an electoral event in the circumstances \n\nis exercised by the Electoral Commissioner and cannot be delegated to others \n\n  must be exercised by prescribing the modification in an instrument that will be tabled \n\nin Parliament \n\n \n\nis time limited, for example available only for the necessary time to respond to the \nemergency situation and its impact, or conduct the electoral event. \n\nTo exercise the authority to make emergency modifications the Electoral Commissioner \nwould have regard to the following matters: \n\n \n\nthe election is conducted in a manner that inspires trust and sustains public \nconfidence \n\nPage 6\n\n\n--- Page 8 ---\n\n \n\n \n\nthe need to ensure the safety of voters and electoral officials \n\nthe election process and release of results occur in a timely manner.  \n\nPractically, the exercise of any authority will be shaped by the time and operational \nenvironment of the given situation, and election delivery options available at that time. \n\nThe exercise of this authority would be subject to Parliamentary scrutiny in the same manner \nas the conduct of federal elections is reviewed in detail by the Joint Standing Committee on \nElectoral Maters. \n\nThe temporary nature of the modification means the electoral system remains unchanged \nonce the emergency situation has passed. \n\nAdjournment and temporary suspension \n\nSections 240A, 241 and 242 of the Electoral Act provide for the temporary suspension of \npolling and adjournment of polling (to another day) in certain circumstances. These sections \ndo not provide for flexibility in who may make a decision to adjourn or suspend polling, or \nprovide for the temporary suspension or adjournment of other election requirements, for \nexample where an emergency may affect close of rolls, nominations, early voting or scrutiny.  \n\nThe AEC recommends that Parliament consider broadening the powers in sections 240A, \n241 and 242 as follows: \n\n  The power to adjourn polling is given to the Electoral Commissioner rather than \npresiding officer, with the Electoral Commissioner having power to delegate this \nresponsibility to other officers as he or she considers appropriate. \n\n  The power to suspend polling be retained for presiding officers, and explicitly \n\nextended to officers in charge of pre-poll voting centres. \n\n  Broaden these powers or establish a new power for the Electoral Commissioner to \n\nsuspend or adjourn other electoral processes during the election period, for example \nwhere an emergency may affect the process such as close of rolls, nominations, \nearly voting or scrutiny. \n\nExisting provisions  \nThe following are areas where the Electoral Act does provide limited flexibility should an \nissue arise shortly before or on polling day.  \n\nThe most recent update to these provisions occurred in 2004, when following \nrecommendation of the AEC and the Committee, section 240A was inserted and section 241 \nwas amended to cover incidents such as a bomb threat, health hazard (the examples \nprovided to the Committee by the AEC at the time included ‘an anthrax scare’ or ‘dangerous \nanimal’), fire or fire alarms or sprinklers being set off.  \n\nTemporary suspension of polling (s240A) \nSection 240A gives presiding officers the power to temporarily suspend polling at their \npolling place for physical or voter safety reasons. The section provides riots, storms, fires, \nand health hazards as specific examples. \n\nPage 7\n\n\n--- Page 9 ---\n\nThis power only allows suspension of polling that has already commenced, and only allows \nfor suspensions until later the same day. \n\nAt the 2019 federal election, polling at the Sydney Central pre-poll voting centre (PPVC) at \nCentral Railway Station, Haymarket, was temporarily suspended after a bag was left \nunattended in the vicinity of the premises. Police attended promptly and polling resumed \napproximately fifteen minutes later. \n\nAdjournment of polling (s241) \nSection 241 gives presiding officers the power to adjourn polling at their polling place for \nphysical or voter safety reasons. Like section 240A, section 241 provides riots, storms, fires, \nand health hazards as specific examples. \n\nThis power only allows for adjournment of polling from one day to the next. For an \nadjournment to continue indefinitely, the presiding officer would need to repeatedly adjourn \npolling each day.  \n\nAt the 2019 federal election polling at the Crows Nest PPVC (NSW), a person died outside \nthe PPVC shortly after voting. Polling was adjourned to the following day. \n\nAdjournment of polling in other cases (s242) \nSection 242 gives presiding officers the general power to adjourn polling if, for any cause, a \npolling booth at a polling place is not opened on polling day. \n\nThis power only allows for adjournment for up to 21 days. \n\nExtension of time for holding an election (s286) \n\nSection 286 gives ‘the person causing the writ to be issued’ (that is, depending on the \nelectoral event involved, either the Governor-General, a state Governor, or the Speaker of \nthe House of Representatives) the broad power to extend the time for holding an election in \norder for ‘meeting any difficulty which might otherwise interfere’ with the election. \n\nThis power has rarely been used and, whilst broad, is not held by any AEC officer. For these \nreasons it is unlikely that the AEC can utilise this power at short notice.    \n\nPage 8\n\n\n--- Page 10 ---\n\nResponding to the COVID-19 \npandemic \n\nThe proposals to amend legislation outlined earlier in the submission are intended to apply \nto the inherent unknowns of most conceivable emergency situations.  \n\nThis said, the COVID-19 pandemic is an example of an emergency situation that, should the \nAEC’s proposals be legislated in a sufficiently swift manner, would allow the Electoral \nCommissioner to adopt modified arrangements for a future election or by-election that could \nimprove the accessibility and safety of an election that takes place during pandemics. \n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic is a highly unusual and unique emergency situation in that while its \nimpacts are evident and highly relevant to the conduct of an election, its length of duration is \nunknown. The pandemic may be with us for some time yet and its impacts for even longer.  \n\nThe AEC’s experience in the delivery of the by-election in the Division of Eden-Monaro \nprovided a sense of considerations that may apply to a federal election conducted during the \npandemic.  \n\nThere are also numerous recent examples of adaptation of election laws and processes to \nthe impacts of COVID-19 nationally and internationally. Some examples are outlined at \nAttachment A. \n\nEden-Monaro by-election \n\nThe AEC demonstrated its agility and professionalism in delivering the Eden-Monaro by-\nelection in the aftermath of the 2019/20 bushfire season and the COVID-19 pandemic. \nSurveys conducted following the election of both voters and the temporary election \nworkforce highlighted their satisfaction with the voting service and safety measures \nimplemented.  \n\nThe Eden-Monaro by-election held on 4 July 2020 was the first federal electoral event to be \nheld during a pandemic in 100 years and one of the first electoral events held in Australia \nduring the COVID-19 pandemic. As such the Eden-Monaro by-election provides an \nopportunity to analyse the implications COVID-19 may have for future electoral events, \nincluding the federal election. \n\nThe AEC set out its commitment to delivering the Eden-Monaro by-election to ensure the \nintegrity of electoral services and participation, and to protect the welfare of voters, staff and \nother participants in the COVID-19 pandemic environment in the Eden-Monaro by-election \nService Plan, which is provided at Attachment B. \n\nThe AEC conducted the by-election in accordance with the Electoral Act which provides for \nin-person voting and postal voting (subject to an application). There was no legislated \n\nPage 9\n\n\n--- Page 11 ---\n\nalternative open to the AEC. However, in evaluating the viability of options (such as 100 per \ncent postal voting, use of electronic voting options or expansion of telephone voting), it was \nclear that the business process in each case would require significant review and adjustment \nin order to facilitate the possibility of using these options. That is, the AEC would not simply \nneed the flexibility to expand or contract the various voting services, but also the flexibility to \nchange components of the process to facilitate an expansion of that scale, and the \nnecessary lead time in which to do that. \n\nConsultation: Delivering a by-election in the COVID-19 environment, in an area already \nimpacted by a natural disaster, required close consultation with a great number of \nstakeholders, including Commonwealth and state government agencies.  \n\nThe breadth and depth of stakeholder consultation and liaison required to run the by-election \nwas not only fundamentally important, but required significant time and resources. The AEC \nhad to work extremely hard, be flexible and agile to establish an acceptable way for voters to \nparticipate safely. \n\nExamples of some of the unprecedented consultation and coordination undertaken within the \ncompressed timeframes of an election included: \n\n  working with the Commonwealth Chief Medical Officer, NSW Chief Health Officer \nand ACT Chief Medical Officer and their respective Departments, as well as the \nAustralian Federal Police and NSW Police, to determine rapidly evolving \nCommonwealth, state and territory laws and health restrictions and determine \nappropriate safety measures to conduct the by-election during the pandemic \n\n  seeking approval from the NSW Minister for Health to be able to hold the by-election  \n\n  hosting a walk-through by the Commonwealth health advisor of the counting centre \nused for the by-election and a polling place mock-up, to demonstrate COVID-safety \nmeasures in place \n\n  seeking approval from the Secretary of the NSW Department of Education for \n\nschools to be used as polling booths \n\n  seeking assistance from the NSW Minister for Local Government to work with local \n\ncouncils regarding the use of facilities as polling places  \n\n  working with the NSW Police Commissioner and NSW Police in relation to the \n\nactivities permitted by the Electoral Act around distribution of how-to-vote material \nand the role of scrutineers, and the AEC approach to implementing the by-election \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nliaison with the National Bushfire Recovery Agency and Resilience NSW to facilitate \naccess to networks involved in supporting bushfire impacted communities \n\nliaison with Services Australia, which supported the AEC in areas affected by the \nbushfires by providing information from the AEC to clients affected by the bushfires, \nand  \n\nliaison with the Chief Executive of Australia Post to ensure there would be no \ndisruption to the delivery of postal votes. \n\nThis high-level activity was supported and arrangements implemented by significant levels of \nofficer-level liaison and coordination. \n\nCommunication: The pandemic has been an incredibly stressful time for the community. \nThe AEC aimed to reduce voter anxiety in our communications campaign by showing the \nAEC was prepared. The AEC’s expanded communication campaign included information \n\nPage 10\n\n\n--- Page 12 ---\n\nconcerning COVID-19 safety measures, with ‘Plan your vote’ as the key message. Public \nawareness survey results indicated: \n\n  at least 85 per cent of respondents were aware of the health measures in place \n\n  all measures made at least three-quarters of respondents feel safer \n\n  nearly all respondents who voted at voting centres were satisfied with the queue time \n\n(98 per cent, which in nearly all cases (96 per cent) was less than 15 minutes). \n\nAn awareness of the environmental context was key to the campaign’s success. \n\nTraining: Following announcement of the by-election, the AEC had to adapt quickly to \ndevelop and deliver appropriate and relevant training to support a COVID-safe by-election. \nThis included specialised training videos and eLearning courses on proper hand hygiene, \nthe use of PPE, cleaning surfaces in a polling place and safely managing queues of voters. \nThese new training resources complement the AEC’s existing suite of learning products, and \nwere produced by the AEC’s specialised National Training and Education Unit in only three \nweeks to meet the timeframe of the by-election. \n\nAdditionally, the AEC’s traditional face-to-face training of polling officials was successfully \ndelivered under new social distancing and hygiene requirements. The by-election \nrepresented the first time that 100 per cent of all polling officials were required to undertake \nat least some of their training online. The AEC’s Learning Management System was able to \nmonitor and report on training completion, to ensure that staff had completed all mandatory \nCOVID-safe courses before commencing work. \n\nVoting services: The AEC expanded the number of pre-poll voting centres compared with \nthe 2019 federal election (13, an increase of 5), had more centres open for the maximum \npre-poll period, and adjusted polling places (71, an increase of 2) to spread the flow of voters \nand communicated these to the electorate, along with the option to postal vote. On the basis \nof advice from the Chief Medical Officer, the AEC did not conduct mobile polling for the \nevent, and instead established a dedicated team to provide advice and facilitate postal \nvoting for aged care facilities and hospitals in the electorate. \n\nCost: The COVID-19 prevention measures had a clear impact on the cost of the by-election \nevent, almost doubling the total cost, to $3.954 million. In comparison, the by-elections held \nbetween 2016 and 2019 cost on average approximately $2 million each. While the AEC is \nassessing any potential efficiencies with what was implemented, the vast majority of \nmeasures will be necessary to implement unless there is a major change in the \nenvironmental risk. The likely impact on the federal election budget is clear. \n\nThe impact on cost is primarily driven by: additional polling locations throughout the pre-poll \nperiod and on polling day; additional staff required for sanitising, queue control and vote \nissuing and counting; PPE and other hygiene materials and services; as well as new \ncommunication and training packages.  \n\nPage 11\n\n\n--- Page 13 ---\n\nImpact on turnout: The by-election had a turnout of 89 per cent, one of the best rates of \nturnout for a by-election, and only a slight drop from the 2019 federal election turnout of 93 \nper cent for Eden-Monaro.  \n\nEligible Electors \n\nTurnout \n\nInformality \n\n2019 federal \nelection \n114,147 \n\n2020 by-\nelection \n114,178 \n\n93.31% \n\n89.13% \n\n6.80% \n\n6.71% \n\n% \nchange \n0.03% \n\n-4.18% \n\n-0.09% \n\nImpact on voting trends: The number of postal votes counted was 13,340, more than \ndouble that at the federal election. The number of pre-poll ordinary votes counted was \n43,701, a moderate increase from the federal election pre-poll ordinary vote of 37,808. \n\nVote type \n\nPre-poll ordinary votes \n\nPre-poll declaration votes \n\nPolling day votes \n\nPostal votes \n\nMobile votes \n\nTotal votes \n\n2019 federal \nelection \n 37,808 \n\n2020 by-\nelection \n43,701 \n\n% \nchange \n15.59% \n\n 6,207 \n\n56,064 \n\n5,969 \n\n457 \n\n156 \n\n-97.49% \n\n44,570 \n\n-20.50% \n\n13,340  123.49% \n\n  -   \n\nN/A \n\n106,505 \n\n101,767 \n\n-4.45% \n\nInteraction between state and federal laws: As outlined further above, an emergency \nsituation may cause conflict between federal and state laws. Where the AEC is attempting to \nmanage competing stakeholder expectations, significant complexity is created. For example \nin the Eden Monaro by-election scrutiny centre, combining social distancing requirements \nwith the entitlement in the Electoral Act for candidates to be represented by one scrutineer \nper counting officer was challenging given the high number of scrutineers that presented on \nelection night. \n\nFacilitation of non-mainstream categories of electors: Careful consideration is required \nto the impact on services to groups such as overseas electors, voters in aged care facilities, \nhospitals, and remote communities. Without the ability to provide in-person voting services, \nonly postal voting is available, which is in turn also impacted by the pandemic situation and \nlikely to result in disenfranchisement of electors. For the Eden-Monaro by-election, only \n9  per cent of postal votes sent to overseas electors were admitted to the count, by \ncomparison the equivalent rate for the 2019 federal election was 33 per cent. \n\nComplexity in federal election planning: The AEC is rapidly approaching its minimum \npossible lead times to make large-scale adjustments to its polling premises footprint, staffing \nand budget estimates; to order required materials; and develop required training, procedures \nand communication packages. As such, the AEC must make some assumptions about the \npotential COVID-19 impact as at the earliest possible federal election date (August 2021) \nand plan for an event in a pandemic. \n\nPage 12\n\n\n--- Page 14 ---\n\nIt should be noted that the requirements and outcomes would certainly have been impacted \nif there were higher levels of community transmission at the time or different local legal \nrequirements in place. It was clear during the Eden-Monaro by-election and in the time \nfollowing, that the dynamic nature of the current environment adds a significant layer of \ncomplexity to planning for an approach to running a federal election in a COVID-19 \nenvironment. This would be compounded where different processes and different materials \nwere required in different states as tailoring training, materials and requirements adds \nadditional complexity, risk and cost.  \n\nData collection and analysis \n\nThe AEC has partnered with Deakin University over a number of election events to collect \ndata on process timings, run scenario modelling and use this information to help inform \ndecisions on the staffing profile, optimum staff numbers and count sizes. This modelling has \nthe dual aim of maximising efficiency and minimising queuing. In a COVID-19 scenario, \nminimising the amount of time people are gathered together in a queue is even more \nimportant.  \n\nData was collected during the Eden-Monaro by-election at a number of polling centres and \nat the counting centre. The data collected shows that issuing and counting processes took \nlonger than those from data collected at previous events. For example, on average the \nordinary vote issuing process took 16.5 seconds (or 46 per cent) longer than at the 2017 \nBennelong by-election.  \n\nIssuing times may be impacted by a number of COVID-19-related factors, for example: \n\n \n\n \n\nthe impact of using masks and screens on communication and efficient vote issuing \n\nissuing staff sanitising hands between voters \n\n  having the main queue outside and reducing the ability to use ‘mini-queues’ at each \n\nissuing point \n\n  handing out single-use pencils \n\n  cleaning issuing points and voting screens. \n\nThe AEC has extrapolated the data collected to model federal event scenarios. The table \nbelow illustrates some of the data modelling conducted to assess the impact of variables on \ntime in queue for a polling place expected to issue around 1,200 ordinary votes.  \n\nThe scenarios modelled varied the number of issuing officers, voting screens, frequency of \nhand sanitiser use, whether issuing officers provided a pencil to the elector, and whether the \nissuing point was covered during breaks taken by the issuing officer. The model then uses \ndata for elector arrival rates across the course of the day, and process timings to arrive at \nestimated average and maximum queues for each scenario. \n\nPage 13\n\n\n--- Page 15 ---\n\nTable 1 – Examples of scenarios for queue modelling, and entry queue wait time, \n1,200 ordinary votes threshold \n\nScenarios  \n\nAverage \n\nMaximum \n\nqueue \n\nqueue \n\n(minutes) \n\n(minutes) \n\nS21  4 ordinary vote issuing officers (IOs); 12 voting screens; IOs used hand \n\n23.33 \n\n55.42 \n\nsanitisation after every elector, provided pencil to elector, issuing point not \n\ncovered during breaks.  \n\nS24  4 IOs; 12 voting screens; IOs used hand sanitisation every 10th elector, \n\n15.99 \n\n45.18 \n\nprovided pencil to elector, issuing point not covered during breaks \n\nS25  4 IOs; 12 voting screens; IOs used hand sanitisation every 10th elector, did not \n\n13.12 \n\n40.15 \n\nprovide pencil to elector, issuing point not covered during breaks \n\nS26  4 IOs; 12 voting screens; IOs used hand sanitisation every 10th elector, did not \n\n3.38 \n\n16.07 \n\nprovide pencil to elector, issuing point covered during breaks \n\nS23  5 IOs; 13 voting screens; IOs used hand sanitisation after every elector, \n\n5.35 \n\n21.85 \n\nprovided pencil to elector, issuing point not covered during breaks \n\nS27  5 IOs; 13 voting screens; IOs used hand sanitisation every 10th elector, \n\n3.17 \n\n13.85 \n\nprovided pencil to elector, issuing point not covered during breaks \n\nS28  5 IOs; 13 voting screens; IOs used hand sanitisation every 10th elector, did not \n\n2.67 \n\n13.65 \n\nprovide pencil to elector, issuing point not covered during breaks \n\nS29  5 IOs; 13 voting screens; IOs used hand sanitisation every 10th elector, did not \n\n0.22 \n\n1.73 \n\nprovide pencil to elector, issuing point covered during breaks \n\nIn order to avoid queue lengths increasing to unacceptable levels, the data modelling shows \nthat it is necessary to reduce the table loading (the number of ballot papers each issuing \nofficer is expected to issue per day), thereby increasing the overall number of issuing staff. \nIn addition, the queue controller positions assigned to each polling place (which would \nnormally only be at busier locations) and new hygiene officer position would remain \nimperative.  \n\nEven in times of emergency and crisis, the AEC is of the view that evidence-based staffing \nestimations that prioritise safety and the efficient flow of voters through a polling place is \npreferred. The images from the recent United State elections of hours-long lines for voting in \nvarious states, such as in Georgia which experienced waiting times of up to 10 hours at one \nlocation on its first day of early voting, are scenes that would not be tolerated by most \nAustralians, even in extraordinary times. \n\nHaving multiple additional staff necessary at every polling location would have a significant \nimpact on cost, particularly when applied to a national electoral event. This equates to an \nestimated 30 per cent increase in polling staff required, costing approximately an additional \n$13 million.  \n\nSupply chain implications  \n\nCOVID-19 PPE procured for the Eden-Monaro by-election was appropriate and effective. \nThe addition of many new materials to AEC polling operations in such a short timeframe \n\nPage 14\n\n\n--- Page 16 ---\n\nrequired new policy development to support polling staff training requirements to create \neffective COVID safety practices and PPE use at polling locations.  \n\nProcurement and consumption analysis data from the Eden-Monaro event has been \npresented in Table 2 below. \n\nThe need for the AEC to continue to ensure its planned practices and PPE will assist it in \nproviding a safe environment for electors, staff and stakeholders needs to be of the highest \npriority for the duration of the pandemic. This is brought into sharp relief by reports this year \nfrom United States election administrators of polling officials and temporary staff falling ill \nwith COVID-19; of partial or full closure of polling and processing operations due to COVID-\n19 illness or close contact; and of the death of staff who worked at polling booths and in \nelections offices, due to COVID-19. \n\nFor the AEC, when considering supply of COVID-19 PPE for a federal election there are \nchallenges with procurement lead times, and supply chain risks to securing these items in \nthe timeframe necessary. Assurance of access to the National Medical Stockpile (controlled \nby the Department of Health) would be necessary to provide significant volumes of common \nPPE items (masks, wipes and sanitiser). This would also address the issue of consistent \nproduct quality as opposed to procuring multiple amounts of different products to meet the \noverall need. COVID-19 global demand for PPE may place supply chains originating \noverseas at risk of not being able to deliver in time for the AEC preparatory needs. \n\nAdditionally, the AEC will face significant challenges for bulk storage availability, and \nassociated costs, for these large volumes of PPE on top of the already large volumes of \nmaterial required for a federal election.  \n\nProcuring specialised materials for COVID-19 prevention may raise the cost of running a \nfederal election by in excess of $30 million. In addition, it is becoming clear that the cost of \nnormal election materials is impacted by the pandemic, where either the materials \nthemselves, or components to make them are often sourced overseas. \n\nTable 2: COVID-19 material required for the Eden-Monaro by-election \n\nProduct \n\nFacemask \n\nQuantity \n\nRequired \n\n11,000 \n\nRemarks \n\nNon-woven material – global shortage – increase \n\nin prices from China \n\nIssuing point screens -\n\n450 \n\nImproved, hardened designed product after by-\n\nSneeze screen \n\nelection experience.

We look forward to the Committee’s consideration of the necessary additional \noperational supports to safeguard democracy and enable the AEC to continue to deliver high \nintegrity elections, including during an emergency situation. \n\nPage 17\n\n\n--- Page 19 ---\n\nAttachment A - Responses to \nCOVID-19 \n\nThe World Health Organisation advises that the virus that causes COVID-19 commonly \nspreads between people through direct, indirect (through contaminated objects or surfaces), \nor close contact with infected people via mouth and nose secretions.1  \n\nThis poses fundamental public health challenges for the conduct of an election, which \ninvolves large gatherings of people for campaigning, canvassing, voting and counting, and \nthe handling of equipment and materials by multiple people. As one study noted, ‘More than \n40 points in the electoral process involve the assembly of people or transfer of objects and \ntherefore pose risks of virus transmission if no preventive measures are taken.’2 \n\nInitially, many governments around the world, including in Australia, took the decision to \npostpone planned elections. However, increasingly, many elections are proceeding with \ngovernments holding national or subnational elections as originally planned despite \nconcerns related to COVID-19, and holding elections that were initially postponed. \n\nThe experience of selected fellow members of the Electoral Council of Australia and New \nZealand (ECANZ) in dealing with scheduled electoral events in 2020 has shown a diversity \nof service models and regulatory approaches to dealing with election delivery in the context \nof rapidly evolving conditions and other challenges associated with the pandemic. \n\nQueensland local government elections were the first large-scale elections conducted in \nAustralia following the declaration of a pandemic, with election day falling on 28 March 2020. \n\nThe elections were delivered in a highly dynamic and uncertain environment. This included \nthe declaration of a pandemic by the WHO during the election period, and urgent legislative \nand regulatory changes impacting electoral processes that came into effect after early voting \nhad commenced on 16 March. Notably, the amended legal framework provided for a \ntemporary regulation making power, and enabled the commission to issue Directions \nconcerning the distribution or display of how-to-vote cards or other election material.3 \n\nThe election saw a significant shift in the voting patterns of the Queensland public compared \nwith previous elections:  \n\n  1.2 million people who voted during the two-week early voting period (500,000 in \n\n2016)  \n\n  470,000 postal votes were returned of the 570,000 issued (320,000 returned in 2016)  \n\n  37,000 people who cast a telephone vote (500 in 2016), and  \n\n1  World Health Organization, Q&A: How is COVID-19 transmitted?, www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/q-a-how-is-covid-19-\ntransmitted, accessed 11 November 2020 \n2 International Foundation for Electoral Systems, Safeguarding Health and Elections, May 2020, p. 4, \nhttps://www.ifes.org/sites/default/files/ifes_covid19_briefing_series_safeguarding_health_and_elections_may_2020.pdf, \naccessed 11 November 2020. \n3 See Public Health and Other Legislation (Public Health Emergency) Amendment Act 2020 (Qld). \n\nPage 18\n\n\n--- Page 20 ---\n\n  750,000 people who voted on election day at a polling booth (1.6 million in 2016). \n\nVoting for the New Zealand general election took place from Saturday 3 October to \nSaturday 17 October. The timing of the election period was delayed for four weeks on 17 \nAugust 2020 following the reemergence of COVID-19 in New Zealand.  \n\nThe legal framework for elections in New Zealand provides powers to respond to defined \nemergency situations. Sections 195 to 195E of the Electoral Act 1993 (NZ), sets out powers \nfor responding to an unforeseen or unavoidable disruption that is likely to prevent voters \nvoting at a polling place or pose a risk to the proper conduct of an election. The provisions:  \n\n  define the situations when provisions for managing polling disruptions may be used \n\n  provide for the use of alternative voting processes to respond to polling disruptions \n\n  provide for an adjournment power \n\n  outline how the effect of polling disruptions on the preliminary vote count is to be \n\nmanage. \n\nNotwithstanding these powers, Regulations were also made which provided for special \nmeasures during a pandemic.4  \n\nMeasures implemented at the election included: \n\n  voters were encouraged to vote early  \n\n  an increase in voting locations  \n\no \n\no \n\nthere were around 750 advanced voting locations (up from 485 at the 2017 \ngeneral election), and this doubled to around 1,500 voting places on the \nweekend before election day \nthere were expected to be around 2,500 voting booths on election day (up \nfrom 2,378 in 2017) 5 \n\n \n\n \n\nthose who were unable to get to a voting place could apply for a postal vote, or ask \nsomeone to bring them their voting papers6 \n\ntelephone dictation voting, normally only available to voters with particular disabilities, \nfor use by voters who were in COVID-19 related managed isolation and quarantine \nfacilities.   \n\nPreliminary election results reported indicated:  \n\n  over 60 per cent of the 3.2 million enrolled voters cast an advance vote (1,976,996, \n\nup from 1,240,740 in 2017)  \n\n \n\nthe largest number of advance votes received was on Saturday 10 October, a week \nbefore the election.7 \n\nElection day for the Queensland state election occurred on Saturday 31 October 2020. \n\n4 See COVID-19 Public Health Response (Election and Referendums) Order 2020 (NZ). \n5 Jason Walls, Election officials are expecting the highest early voting turnout in history this election, New Zealand Herald, \n27  July 2020 2:20pm, https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=12351328, accessed 11 November \n2020. \n6 New Zealand Electoral Commission, 2020 General Election: COVID-19, https://vote.nz/voting/2020-general-election/covid-19/, \naccessed 10 November 2020.  \n7 Radio New Zealand, Election 2020: Advance votes total just under 2 million, 17 October 2020, \nhttps://www.rnz.co.nz/news/political/428576/election-2020-advance-votes-total-just-under-2-million, accessed 30 October 2020.  \n\nPage 19\n\n\n--- Page 21 ---\n\nDue to the ongoing risk posed by COVID-19, the Electoral Commission of Queensland \nadapted its election delivery model. The model was supported by legislative enhancements \nresulting from passage of the Electoral and Other Legislation (Accountability, Integrity and \nOther Matters) Amendment Act 2020. This Act included amendments to the Electoral Act \n1992 (Qld) providing extra flexibility in the statutory framework for the elections including:  \n\n \n\nflexibility to change dates for election milestones contained in the writ  \n\n  ability for the ECQ to issue notices that change timeframes for postal vote \n\napplications and expand eligibility for telephone voting  \n\n  power for the ECQ to issue directions regulating the handing out of election materials \n\nor how-to-vote cards near polling place and the activity of scrutineers, and  \n\n  ability to declare certain classes of voters or electorates to automatically receive a \n\npostal vote by regulation. \n\nMeasures in place for the election included: \n\n \n\nthe election was conducted over an election period rather than focussing on an \nelection day  \n\n  expanded early voting options were available across the two-week early voting \n\nperiod, with extra centres established, and extended operating hours, including from \n9am to 4pm on the Saturday prior to election day  \n\n  electors were, for the first time, able to apply for a postal vote before the issue of the \n\nwrit with applications opening from 14 September 2020 \n\n  declaration of additional categories of electors eligible for telephone voting, and  \n\n  special arrangements for postal voting in aged care and rehabilitation facilities which \n\nwould usually receive a mobile polling service. \n\nWhile the election count is still being finalised, pre-poll and postal votes will exceed the \nvolumes received at the March 2020 election, with many more people casting their vote \nbefore election day than on election day.  \n\nBeyond ECANZ, Elections Canada is presently engaging with the Canadian Parliament in \nrelation to legislative responses that may assist it deliver an accessible, safe and secure \nelection. \n\nKey elements of its suggested changes, which it proposes to apply to the next general \nelection only, include a focus on: \n\n  extending the voting period, shifting polling day from one 12-hour period on a \n\nMonday to 8 hours per day on a Saturday and a Sunday \n\n \n\nflexibility in approach to aged care facility voting, enabling the Chief Electoral Officer \nto prescribe the timing and manner in which voting occurs at these facilities \n\n  extending the existing ‘adaptation power’ in section 17 of the Canada Elections Act to \n\ninclude all areas within the Chief Electoral Officer’s mandate. \n\nPage 20\n\n\n--- Page 22 ---\n\nAttachment B – Eden-Monaro by-\nelection Service Plan \n\nPage 21\n\n\n--- Page 23 ---\n\n28 May 2020 \n\nEden-Monaro \nby-election \nService Plan \n\nMay 2020\n\n\n--- Page 24 ---\n\nForeword  \n\nThe AEC is committed to providing the highest standard of electoral services for the Eden-\nMonaro by-election. During the COVID-19 pandemic this includes a range of safety \nmeasures for voters, AEC staff and other participants.  \n\nWe have introduced a range of COVID-19 safety measures at voting venues and also \nthrough the entire by-election process, including the receipt and declaration of nominations, \nthe management of election materials and at our counting centre.  \n\nThe operating model for this by-election includes social distancing and hygiene measures \nthat conform with federal and local health advice and are also within the legislative \nframework of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918. The infection-control advice the AEC is \nfollowing has been provided by the Australian Government’s Chief Medical Officer, and \nrelevant NSW and ACT health authorities. \n\nIt is also important to note these measures, which must be enacted to protect the \ncommunity, will inevitably slow the voting process. Whilst we are implementing measures to \ntry and reduce this impact, the AEC thanks all electors and participants for their patience and \nadherence to the new measures in the polling place and at our count centre. \n\nThe counting of votes will also take longer due to the measures in place in polling places and \nat our counting centre. The expected increase in postal and pre-poll votes cast will also \nimpact the speed of the count, noting the legislative requirement to wait 13 days after \nelection day for the return of postal votes.  \n\nAs a result, it is likely to take longer to formally declare a final result in this by-election \ncompared with previous federal by-elections but, as per our normal practice, the AEC will do \neverything possible to provide an indicative result on polling night. \n\nThe AEC is committed to continuous improvement. This service plan outlines the key \nelection services and standards that will underpin the AEC’s delivery of the 2020 Eden-\nMonaro by-election during a pandemic. \n\nShould you have any comments on the service plan or the AEC’s delivery on these \ncommitments, I would ask you to take the time to let us know through our online enquiry \nform so we can consider your feedback as we continue to improve the delivery of election \nservices. \n\nTom Rogers  \nElectoral Commissioner \n\nPage 1 \n\nEden-Monaro by-election Service Plan\n\n\n--- Page 25 ---\n\nCOVID-19 related measures  \nfor the Eden-Monaro by-election \n\nThe operating model for the by-election will see measures introduced that conform with \nfederal and local health advice and are applied within the Commonwealth Electoral Act \n1918. The infection-control advice the AEC is following has been provided by the Australian \nGovernment’s Chief Medical Officer, and reviewed by NSW and ACT health authorities. \n\nIt is also important to note these measures, which must be put in place to protect the \ncommunity, will inevitably slow the voting process. Whilst we are implementing measures to \ntry and reduce this impact, the AEC thanks all electors and participants for their patience and \nadherence to the new measures in the polling places and at our count centre. \n\nThe counting of votes will also take longer due to the measures in place in our polling places \nand at our counting centre. The expected increase in postal and pre-poll votes cast will also \nimpact the speed of the count, noting also the legislative requirement to wait 13 days after \nelection day for the return of postal votes. As a result, it is likely to take longer to formally \ndeclare a final result in this by-election compared with previous federal by-elections but, as \nper our normal practice, the AEC will do everything possible to provide an indicative result \non polling night. \n\nThis document outlines the ways in which the key processes in the operation of the by-\nelection will be modified or enhanced.  \n\nTaking nominations  \n\nPeople wishing to nominate for the by-election will need to make an appointment with the \nDivisional Returning Officer for Eden-Monaro before attending the AEC office to lodge their \nnomination forms. At the office, hand sanitiser will be available at the entrance, on all \nmeeting tables, and on the way out. AEC staff may wear surgical masks, and social \ndistancing of 1.5 metres will be in place wherever possible between staff and nominees.  \n\nWhere possible AEC staff will also seek to minimise the amount of back-and-forth handling \nof forms. Contactless Eftpos facilities will be available for candidates to pay their nomination \nfee. \n\nBallot draw \n\nSocial-distancing rules will apply to everybody attending the ballot draw and seating will be \nappropriately spaced. Hand sanitiser will be at the entrance and exit of the venue. \n\nAEC staff performing the ballot draw will observe necessary personal hygiene measures and \nsanitise the equipment used. \n\nPage 2 \n\nEden-Monaro by-election Service Plan\n\n\n--- Page 26 ---\n\nDuring training \n\nOur online training suite has been enhanced to include a new online training module on the \nrequired health measures put in place for this by-election. This will be mandatory for all AEC \nstaff and temporary election workers working at this by-election. Where AEC staff conduct \nface-to-face training, social-distancing rules will be observed and all of the health measures \nthat will be applied throughout the by-election will also be observed throughout the \ncorresponding practical exercises. Hand sanitiser will be available on arrival and exit, and \nparticipants will wash or sanitise their hands before and after each practical exercise. \n\nVoting for residents of aged care facilities and hospital patients \n\nThe AEC is very conscious of the health and safety of voters during the by-election; \nparticularly those who are potentially vulnerable to infection. Accordingly, we have adopted \nspecial measures to protect residents of aged care facilities and hospitals in the Eden-\nMonaro electorate during these extraordinary times, whilst still ensuring they can exercise \ntheir right to vote. Based on medical advice, the AEC will be providing effective alternatives \nto mobile polling (which are normally a feature of electoral events). Specifically, the AEC has \nestablished a support team for these facilities and has already provided enrolment forms and \ngeneral postal vote applications for residents to complete and return to the AEC. Residents \nof aged care facilities and hospitals will have the option to either vote via a postal vote \ndelivered directly to their facility; telephone voting for those who are blind or low vision; or by \nattending a polling location (depending on their personal circumstances), which will have \nhealth and safety measures in place.  \n\nThe AEC will also maintain ongoing contact with aged care facilities and relevant hospitals in \nthe Division of Eden-Monaro to provide support, answer questions and deliver additional \nenrolment and postal vote application forms, if needed.  \n\nBlind and Low Vision \n\nVoters who are blind or have low vision can cast a vote in secret by telephone from any \nlocation for the Eden-Monaro by-election. \n\nTelephone voting is a simple two-step process, voters who are blind or have low vision will \nbe invited to register for a telephone vote by calling a dedicated 1800 number for this \nelection. They will not need to give their name when they vote using the telephone voting \nservice. Their registration number and pin will be used to mark their name off the electoral \nroll, ensuring the voter’s identity remains secret. \n\nPostal voting \n\nPostal voting will be an important voting option available to eligible Eden-Monaro electors. \nPostal voting helps minimise contact and movement, and given the COVID-19 environment, \nit is anticipated that a greater number of voters will meet the eligibility criteria under the \nlegislation to apply for a postal vote in this by-election. \n\nPage 3 \n\nEden-Monaro by-election Service Plan\n\n\n--- Page 27 ---\n\nVoting at polling places \n\nIf on arrival voters are not able to immediately enter the \npolling place, they will be required to queue outside \nwhere social-distancing rules will be in place. Extra \nqueue controllers that have been appropriately trained \nin social-distancing rules and the traditional “six-metre \nrule” regarding campaigners will be outside the polling \nplace to ensure adherence to these important \nmeasures. \n\nThe number of voters entering a polling place will be \ncounted at the door to limit the number of people inside \nthe polling place at any one time. Hand sanitiser will be \navailable at the entrance to the polling place and at \neach ballot-paper issuing point and when exiting the \npolling place. Signage about hygiene and social \ndistancing will be prominent in the polling place for \nvoters and staff.  \n\nWhere possible a “sneeze shield” will be installed at all ballot-paper issuing points, and \nissuing tables will be sprayed regularly with sanitising spray throughout the day and \nwhenever issuing staff are rotated. Voters will be encouraged to bring their own pencil or pen \nto the polling place but electors will also be offered a single-use pencil when handed their \nballot papers. \n\nVoting screens will separated by a distance of 1.5 metres and the plastic writing surface \ninserted into the voting screen will be regularly cleaned with sanitising spray throughout \npolling day. \n\nAEC staff may wear surgical masks and will under no circumstances share their bibs or \nlanyards with other staff. Bio-hazard bags will be used for the disposal of surgical masks, \ngloves and cleaning cloth waste.  \n\nPhoto opportunities of the inside of a polling place will only be allowed when there is a \nsufficiently low number of voters present so social distancing can be maintained, and when \nthe Officer-in-Charge approves. \n\nCampaigning at polling places \n\nWhilst the AEC has no legislative jurisdiction or responsibility for campaigners outside six \nmetres of the entrance to the polling place, we acknowledge that the current COVID-19 \nenvironment may impact on their ability to hand our how-to-vote cards as they ordinarily \nwould for any other federal electoral event. Parties and candidates will need to ensure that \nthose campaigning on their behalf near a polling venue have fully informed themselves of \nNSW Government health restrictions and laws in place regarding social distancing, and that \nthey abide by these directives. \n\nAcknowledging the challenges faced by parties and candidates for this by-election, the AEC \nhas decided to assist parties and candidates by seeking to collect the details of all \ncandidate’s official campaign website addresses at the time of nomination. The AEC will \n\nPage 4 \n\nEden-Monaro by-election Service Plan\n\n\n--- Page 28 ---\n\nprovide a link to these websites which will be available on the AEC website alongside the \ncandidate’s details. \n\nCounting on election night at polling places \n\nAfter 6pm, when the counting commences at polling places, hand sanitiser for all polling \nplace officials and scrutineers will be at the polling place entry point, at each sorting and \ncounting table, and at the exit to the polling place.  \n\nBallot boxes will be cleaned with sanitising spray before they are opened for counting on the \ntables. Staff will sanitise their hands immediately before and after they handle ballot-box \ntags. \n\nSurgical masks may be worn by both staff and scrutineers, and no sharing of bibs or \nlanyards will be allowed. If practicable, “sneeze shields” may be used at each counting and \nsorting table to separate scrutineers from counting staff. \n\nThere will be signs outlining the hygiene and social distancing rules, and those who do not \nadhere to the rules will be requested to leave.  \n\nThe area used for polling and counting at each polling place will be fully cleaned after \nelection night. \n\nCounting at AEC out-posted centres \n\nHand sanitiser will be available at the entry and exit of the out-posted centre (OPC), at each \nsorting and counting table and in break-out areas.  \n\nThe outside surfaces of election materials returned to the OPC – including ballot boxes \ntransported on election night from pre-poll voting centres – will be cleaned with sanitising \nspray on arrival. \n\nBallot boxes will be cleaned with sanitising spray before opening, and staff will wash or \nsanitise their hands after handling ballot-box tags, and before and after each count of ballot \npapers. Surgical masks may be worn both by staff and scrutineers and, if practicable, \n“sneeze shields” will be used at each counting and sorting table to separate scrutineers from \ncounting staff. \n\nThe OPC will be set up with prominent hygiene signage and 1.5-metre standard markings on \nthe floor. There will be regular cleaning of surfaces, equipment and break-out areas during \noperational hours. Only single-use water bottles will be allowed, all plates and cutlery must \nbe disposable, and there will be no provision for the serving of coffee or tea inside. \n\nAll equipment used for scrutiny will be cleaned before installing and it will also be regularly \ncleaned during use and before return. Additional Security Officers and Hygiene Officers will \nbe present in the OPC to ensure everyone’s safety and adherence to the health measures. \nThey will be wearing distinctive bibs.  \n\nDeep cleaning of the OPC will occur overnight and at the conclusion of the counting. \nBiohazard bags will be used to dispose of all waste from the clearing process.  \n\nPage 5 \n\nEden-Monaro by-election Service Plan\n\n\n--- Page 29 ---\n\nWhen counting postal votes \n\nThe outside of all transport containers used by Australia Post or couriers will be sprayed with \nsanitising spray prior to opening. \n\nHand sanitiser will be regularly applied by staff before opening batches of postal-vote \nenvelopes and the extraction of ballot papers. Staff will also wash or sanitise their hands \nimmediately before and after each count or when they handle batches of ballot papers.  \n\nSurgical masks should be worn by both staff and scrutineers.  \n\nAt the declaration of the poll \n\nSocial-distancing rules will apply to all in attendance and seating will be appropriately \nspaced.
