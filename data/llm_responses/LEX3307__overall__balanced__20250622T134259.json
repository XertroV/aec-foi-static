Specific examples provided include the party register (including membership testing), physical security of AEC operations, and the integrity, accuracy, and legality of AEC counting algorithms (especially in light of LEX3029).\n\n*   **Documents from FOI Request:** The released document is the \"Endorsed minutes for Commission Meeting No. 278, held on 29 March 2022.\"\n\n*   **Main Content Related to FOI Request:** The primary content of the released minutes (Meeting No. 278) focuses on the review of a delegate's decision to deregister the ‘Australian People’s Party’. The Commission affirmed the deregistration, having been satisfied that the party, as a non-Parliamentary entity, did not meet the requirement of having at least 1,500 members, as per s 137(6) of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918. This directly relates to the FOI request's interest in the \"party register incl. membership testing\" as an aspect of electoral process integrity."
