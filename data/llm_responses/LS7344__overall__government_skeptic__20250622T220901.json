            "text": "The released FOI documents, in response to a request for correspondence between the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) and US tech giants Facebook and Twitter regarding compliance with the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918, reveal a concerning degree of collaboration and planned intervention between a government regulator and a foreign private corporation. Notably, while the request encompassed both Facebook and Twitter, only documents pertaining to Twitter were provided, immediately raising questions about the completeness of the disclosure or the extent of government engagement with other major platforms.\n\nThe documents primarily detail exchanges from August 2018, illustrating a cooperative relationship where Twitter's representatives meet with the AEC, expressing a desire to \"develop detailed and efficient ways to handle any issues that might arise during future campaigns and elections.\" This language, while seemingly innocuous, can be interpreted as a proactive move towards managing and potentially limiting public discourse on the platform under the guise of \"efficiency.\"\n\nFurther blurring the lines between regulation and corporate influence, Twitter offered to conduct a \"media workshop\" for AEC staff, framed as an update on \"Twitter's media solutions\" and showcasing \"the best way to utilise the platform from a campaign perspective.\" This suggests the AEC, the body responsible for fair elections, might be receiving guidance or even implicit direction on campaigning from a private entity with its own commercial interests, potentially creating an uneven playing field or subtly endorsing certain campaign methods. This also raises questions about potential waste of public resources if the AEC is relying on such external, potentially biased, \"training.\"\n\nThe most significant revelations come from the AEC's proposals for managing electoral communications on Twitter. The AEC outlines scenarios where it would request Twitter to \"remove or block\" content deemed non-compliant with authorisation requirements, including anonymous communications or paid ads lacking proper disclosure. This indicates a direct outsourcing of content moderation and potential censorship power from an Australian government agency to a foreign private company, bypassing formal Australian judicial processes and creating an unaccountable system for determining what content is permissible.\n\nEven more concerning is the AEC's stated intent to seek \"further details on the person or entity responsible\" for content that \"may breach more serious electoral offences,\" such as those \"likely to mislead or deceive an elector.\" While the Electoral Act is explicitly stated not to regulate \"truth in electoral communications,\" the AEC's interest in \"misleading or deceptive\" content suggests a creeping overreach into content regulation beyond simple authorisation. This also raises significant privacy concerns, as Twitter is implicitly expected to share user data with the government, or at the very least, make determinations about users' identities and compliance without full transparency to the public or independent oversight.\n\nFinally, the AEC's explicit warning that it \"may get an injunction\" against Twitter if the platform \"is unable to remove or block a communication... or cannot provide information\" serves as a thinly veiled threat. This highlights the coercive power the government is willing to wield over private companies to ensure compliance with its content management demands, demonstrating a pattern of exerting control over digital information flows through external intermediaries rather than direct, transparent government action with clear accountability.\n\nIn sum, these documents paint a picture of a government agency actively seeking to control electoral discourse online through a private platform, raising serious questions about transparency, due process, potential overreach into content regulation, and the outsourcing of censorship to a foreign corporation under implicit coercion. The absence of Facebook documents further casts doubt on the completeness of information provided under the FOI."

At the meeting I said I would provide some \nscenarios on how we can manage electoral communications on Twitter that do not comply \nwith the authorisation requirements in the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 (Electoral \nAct).  The closer the electoral communication is to a Federal election the more urgent it will \nbe to either obtain prompt compliance with the Electoral Act or to block or remove the \nnon-compliant communication.  To this end the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) is \nkeen to agree on the process with Twitter for escalating and resolving any such matters.   \n\nI have set out below three scenarios.  The first two scenarios are the most likely occur, the \nthird scenario will only arise if the AEC is concerned that a communication may breach more \nserious electoral offences in Part XXI of the Electoral Act.  For each scenario I have outlined \nthe actions the AEC will take, when we will contact you and the assistance we will require \nfrom Twitter.  For completeness I have included a summary of the authorisation \nrequirements in the Electoral Act.   \n\nGiven the increasing use of social media by political participants, we are interested in your \nviews on the processes suggested below for escalating and resolving any Electoral Act \ncompliance issues that may arise with electoral communications on social media. \n\nKind regards \n\nAndrew Johnson | Principal Government Lawyer \nElectoral Authorisation Section | Legal & Procurement Branch \nAustralian Electoral Commission \nT: (02) 6271 4759 | M: \n\n7LS7344 Released Document No 4Released under the Freedom of Information Act 1982\n\n\n--- Page 2 ---\n\nAuthorisation of electoral communications on \nsocial media scenarios \n\n1.  Paid electoral advertisement on Twitter without proper authorisation \n\nIssue:  Paid electoral advertisements require an authorisation to allow voters to know who is \n\ncommunicating the advertisement. \n\nActions: \n\nEvent \nUnauthorised electoral ad on \nTwitter  \n\nEntity \nAEC \n\nInadequate response from \nperson or entity responsible \nfor the electoral ad \nAEC notifies Twitter of the \nunauthorised electoral ad \n\nAEC \n\nTwitter \n\nAction \nContact or attempt to contact the person or entity \nresponsible for the electoral ad to advise of the legal \nrequirements in the Electoral Act and ask them to \nrectify or remove the ad. \nNotify Twitter of an unauthorised electoral ad on \nsocial media site. \n\nRemove or block the electoral ad, or contact the \nperson or entity responsible for the ad and advise \nthem to add an authorisation or have the ad \nremoved or blocked. \n\n2.  Anonymous communication on Twitter containing electoral matter \n\nIssue:  AEC unable to determine whether an anonymous communication is electoral matter that \n\nrequires an authorisation under the Electoral Act. \n\nActions: \n\nEvent \nAnonymous communication \ncontaining electoral matter on \nTwitter \n\nEntity \nAEC \n\nInadequate response from \nperson or entity responsible for \nthe anonymous electoral \ncommunication \nAEC notifies Twitter of the \nelectoral communication and the \nneed to settle whether the \nresponsible person or entity is a \ndisclosure entity \nConfirm the person or entity \nresponsible for the electoral \ncommunication is: * \n  not a disclosure entity  \n\nAEC \n\nTwitter \n\nTwitter \n\nAction \nContact or attempt to contact the person or \nentity responsible for the electoral \ncommunication to ascertain whether they are a \ndisclosure entity and advise of the legal \nrequirements for disclosure entities to authorise \nelectoral communications. \nNotify Twitter of an anonymous communication \ncontaining electoral matter and the need to \nascertain whether the responsible person or \nentity is a disclosure entity. \nContact the person or entity responsible for the \nelectoral communication to advise of the \nauthorisation requirements in the Electoral Act.   \n\n  Advise the AEC. No further action. \n\nLS7344 Released Document No 4Released under the Freedom of Information Act 1982\n\n\n--- Page 3 ---\n\n  a disclosure entity  \n\n  Advise the AEC. Remove or block the \n\ncommunication if the responsible person \nor entity does not take action to add an \nauthorisation in compliance with the \nElectoral Act. \n\n*   If Twitter is able to confirm whether a person or entity is a disclosure entity, this will \navoid the need to share personal or commercial information with the AEC.  AEC can \nprovide advice on the categories of a persons or entities that are disclosure entities for \nthe purposes of the Electoral Act.   \n\n3.  Paid electoral advertisement on Twitter that infringes other offences in \n\nthe Electoral Act  \n\nIssue:  In addition to the issues raised above, the AEC may need further details on the person or \nentity responsible for an electoral communication to consider other civil or criminal action \nunder the Electoral Act.  For example it is an offence under section 329 of the Electoral Act to \npublish or distribute or cause to be published or distributed any electoral communication that \nis likely to mislead or deceive an elector in relation to the casting of a vote. \n\nActions:  In addition to the actions outlined above: \n\nEvent \nIncomplete information on the \nperson or entity responsible for \nan electoral communication on \nsocial media \nRequest from the AEC for \ninformation \n\nEntity \nAEC \n\nAction \nSeek information from Twitter about the person \nor entity responsible for the communication. \n\nTwitter \n\nProvide the AEC the requested information. \n\nIn any of the above scenarios, if Twitter is unable to remove or block a communication that does not \ncomply with the Electoral Act or cannot provide information about the person or entity responsible \nfor the communication, then the AEC (or a candidate in an election) may get an injunction under \nsection 383 of the Electoral Act against the person or entity responsible for the communication \nand/or Twitter. \n\nBackground \nThe Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 (Electoral Act) is concerned that voters know who is \ncommunicating an electoral matter to them (electoral communication).  The Electoral Act does not \nregulate truth in electoral communications.  Part XXA of the Electoral Act requires electoral \ncommunications to have an authorisation to inform voters who is responsible for the \ncommunication. \n\nFor a social media communication to be an electoral communication requiring an authorisation \nunder section 321D of the Electoral Act, the communication must: \n\n \n\ncontain electoral matter, and \n\n  be at least one of the following: \n\no  a paid electoral advertisement, \n\nLS7344 Released Document No 4Released under the Freedom of Information Act 1982\n\n\n--- Page 4 ---\n\no  a matter communicated by, on behalf of, a disclosure entity. \n\n‘Electoral matter’ is defined in section 4(1) of the Electoral Act as ‘matter which is intended or likely \nto affect voting in an election’. For the purpose of the authorisation requirements in Part XXA of the \nElectoral Act, paragraph 4(9)(b) clarifies that there must be a sufficient connection between the \nsubject matters of federal elections:  \n\n(9)   Without limiting the definition of electoral matter in subsection (1), matter is taken to be \n\nintended or likely to affect voting in an election if: \n\n(b)    … in Part XXA—it contains an express or implicit reference to: \n\n(i)    the election; or \n\n(ii)   a political party, a branch or division of a political party or a candidate or group \n\nof candidates in the election; or \n\n(iii)  an issue submitted to, or otherwise before, the electors in connection with the \n\nelection. \n\n‘Disclosure entity’ is defined in section 321B of the Electoral Act to be a political party, associated \nentity, member of the House of Representatives, Senator, a candidate or group of candidates in a \nfederal election or other persons or entities who engage in the electoral process and are required by \nthe Electoral Act to provide a return. \n\nFrom: Evan Ekin-Smyth  \nSent: Thursday, 23 August 2018 10:54 AM \nTo: Emily Foat <emilyfoat@twitter.com>; Kara Hinesley <khinesley@twitter.com> \nCc: Tim Courtney <Tim.Courtney@aec.gov.au>; Andrew Johnson <Andrew.Johnson@aec.gov.au> \nSubject: RE: Twitter Follow-up [DLM=For-Official-Use-Only] \n\nThanks Kara and Emily – it was certainly good to meet you both and talk through election \nscenarios.  \n\nKara, I imagine Andrew will send through a specific scenario just to bed in what we were \ntalking about.
