It outlines key obligations under relevant legislation, including the *Public Service Act 1999*, *Privacy Act 1988*, and *Crimes Act 1914*, along with AEC-specific policies.\n\nKey obligations declared by staff include:\n*   Maintaining political neutrality as a condition of engagement.\n*   Avoiding real or apparent conflicts of interest and promptly reporting them.\n*   Declaring non-engagement in public political activities during employment.\n*   Ensuring accuracy of information provided for engagement.\n*   Adhering to Workplace Health and Safety policies.\n*   Familiarising themselves with and upholding relevant legislation, policies, and procedures.\n*   Ensuring the security, integrity, and accountability of Ballot Papers.\n\nThe document explicitly lists the APS Values, APS Employment Principles, and Code of Conduct as fundamental provisions. It also details other relevant areas such as government information and privacy (including disclosure of information, Privacy Act, and Archives Act), specific AEC policies (e.g., political neutrality, Ballot Paper Principles, gifts, outside employment), other criminal offences (e.g., fraud, abuse of public office), financial management accountability, and internal policies on email, internet usage, security, and respect at work. Expected behaviours related to \"Ballot Paper Principles\" are also detailed, covering professionalism, agility, and quality.\n\n### Relevance to FOI Request\n\nThis document is highly relevant to FOI Request No. LEX3437 concerning AEC policies governing staff conduct and public engagement.\n\n*   **Staff adherence to APS Values, Employment Principles, and Code of Conduct:** The document directly addresses this by explicitly stating that staff must acknowledge and uphold the APS Values, Employment Principles, and Code of Conduct. It details specific obligations such as political neutrality, conflict of interest, and general ethical conduct that are inherent to these frameworks. The document serves as a \"mandatory obligation acknowledgement,\" reinforcing commitment to these principles as highlighted in the FOI request overview.\n*   **Limitations on staff telephone communication with the public:** While not specifically outlining rules for telephone communication, the document establishes the foundational principles of professional conduct, information privacy, security, and non-disclosure that underpin all forms of public interaction, including telephone calls. Policies referenced, such as those related to government information, privacy, security, and the disclosure of information, would directly govern appropriate communication practices with the public.\n*   **MOUs with the Australian Federal Police (AFP):** The document does not contain any information or reference pertaining to Memoranda of Understanding with the Australian Federal Police."
