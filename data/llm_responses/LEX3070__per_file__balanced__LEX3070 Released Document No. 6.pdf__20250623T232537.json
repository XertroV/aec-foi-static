The core argument is that the AEC's party membership verification methodology is statistically flawed and inaccurate.\n\nThe applicant contends that the AEC's method exhibits a high false-negative rate (e.g., 72.34% ± 0.12% for HAP's Feb 2022 test if the party had over 1769 members), leading to an inability for the AEC to be statistically confident in its deregistration decisions. It highlights that AEC policy limits the number of members a party can submit for testing, preventing parties from demonstrating sufficient membership even if they possess it (HAP claims ~4,000 members). The application requests that HAP's deregistration decision be set aside and broadly suggests the AEC should reconsider its entire testing framework due to these methodological deficiencies.\n\n**Relevance to FOI Request:** This document is highly relevant as it is an application made under s 141(2) during early 2022 concerning a party deregistration decision. It directly aligns with the FOI request's theme of challenges to the AEC's administrative processes, particularly the party membership verification methodology. The document explicitly details concerns regarding the statistical validity, fairness, and arbitrary outcomes of the AEC's method, mirroring the broader challenges raised by other parties like Flux (who described the method as \"rigged\") and the Democratic Labour Party."

  "prompt": "Considering this document as part of an FOI request, summarize the document and its relevance to the FOI request in markdown format. Provide only the markdown formatted summary text. Do not include any conversational filler or preamble.To aid you, the overview of the FOI request is: [REQUEST OVERVIEW START] The FOI request (LEX3070) sought applications made to the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) under s 141(2) of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 during early 2022, concerning reviews of party registration and deregistration decisions. The released documents, primarily communications and a detailed statistical analysis, reveal a strong theme of challenges to the AEC's administrative processes. Key content includes multiple parties (e.g., Democratic Labour Party, Flux, Health Australia Party) arguing that the AEC's party membership verification methodology is statistically flawed, unfair, and results in arbitrary deregistration outcomes, with Flux providing extensive analysis asserting the method is \"rigged.\" Additional challenges include the Australian Progressives alleging a clerical error in their deregistration, an objection to the registration of the David Pocock party based on candidate eligibility and name consistency, and an objection to the Australian Federation Party's logo for potential voter confusion.\n [REQUEST OVERVIEW END] \n\n--- MAIN DOCUMENT TEXT START ---\n\n\n\n--- Page 1 ---\n\nFrom:\nSent:\nTo:\nSubject:\n\nThursday, 5 May 2022 3:22 PM\nCommission Secretariat\nApplication under s 141(2) regarding Health Australia Party\n\nCAUTION: This email originated from outside of the Australian Federal Government. Do not click links or open \nattachments unless you recognise the sender and know the content is safe. \n\nTo: Mr Tom Rogers \nvia email: commission.secretariat@aec.gov.au \n\nHi, \n\nThis is an application under s 141(2) of the EA to review the decision to deregister Health Australia Party (HAP) [1]. \n\nI learned of HAP's deregistration on the 14th of April. \n\nAs a voter I am affected by the wrongful deregistration of political parties and I am concerned that the AEC's \nprocesses are inadequate. Thus I am concerned that wrongful deregistrations have occurred many times and are \ncontinuing to occur -- HAP being just one example of more than a do en. \n\nParticularly: I do not believe the AEC's membership testing method is accurate enough to support the decision. \n\nThis is because, based on the statistics gathered and published by the AEC in [1], the AEC's method had a false \nnegative rate of 72.34% ± 0.12% if HAP has > 1769 members. That is, *if* HAP has > 1769 members, *then* it is \nexpected that the AEC's method has that false negative rate. \n\nThe number 1769 is important because, based on the data gathered by the AEC, *if* HAP could have submitted \n1769 members then they would have passed this hypothetical membership test. (Note, there is no mathematical \nreason that the membership test methodology could not simply allow longer lists; the only restriction is *AEC policy \nalone*.) \n\nHAP's Nov 2021 membe ship test had a false negative rate of 72.40% ± 0.12% if HAP has > 1769 members. \n\nThis means that, if HAP has more than 1769 members (which would imply they are an eligible party), that the \nprobability that HAP passed either the first test or failed the first but passed the second was only 0.476 -- i.e., 47.6%. \nThat's worse odds than a coin flip. \n\nS nce the AEC, *by the Commission's own policy,* does not allow a party to submit more than 1650 members as \npart of the test methodology, there is no way -- by the best known principles of statistics and the philosophy of \nscience available to us -- that the AEC can be statistically confident in the results of the membership test \nmethodology, and thus the Commission does not have statistical grounds for the decision to deregister. This is \nespecially poignant considering that HAP claims to have ~4,000 members nationally [1]. Considering the AEC's \nmeasurements to-date, it is reasonable to expect that HAP could produce an additional 129 members unless \nevidence can be produced to contradict this. The membership testing method does not gather such evidence -- and \nparties are forbidden from submitting additional members -- so it is a mystery how the AEC would have such \nevidence. In fact, if the lists that HAP submitted to the AEC have fewer than 1521 overlapping members, HAP has \n\n1\n\nLEX3070 Released Document No. 6Released under the Freedom of Information Act 198210\n\n\n--- Page 2 ---\n\nalready proven to the AEC that it does have sufficient membership. \n\nHow many members were on both lists submitted by HAP? \n\nGiven the above, I request that the decision to deregister HAP be set aside. \n\nAs evidence of my claims, please see [2] -- particularly Fig 6.6 which is the results of the statistical analysis of HAP's \nFeb 2022 membership test. (A link to the results of the analysis of HAP's Nov 2021 membership test are linked in Fig \n6.6's description.) \n\nAdditionally, I note that the AEC has made trivial mistakes in the documentation and execution of the method (see \n[3]), so I have no faith that those employees or delegates of the Commission that execute the method have any idea \nwhatsoever about how to do it correctly, what the requirements for statistical validity are, or how to check that they \nare not making a mistake. \n\nThus, the Commission should also reconsider their entire testing framework, setting aside all decisions to deregister \nor refuse registration on the basis of the results of the testing method until such a time when the Commission \nobtains the relevant skills necessary to develop a method that is not predetermined  n some cases. I can't request \nthat under s 141(2); it's just my opinion. Seems worth mentioning, though. \n\nMax Kaye \n\n[1]: \nhttps://www.aec.gov.au/Parties and Representatives/Party Registration/Deregistered parties/files/statement-of-\nreasons-health-australia-party.pdf \n\n[2]: https://xertrov.github.io/aec-membership-test-simulator/#6-suspected-farces \n\n[3]: https://xertrov.github.io/aec-membership-test-simulator/#circa-2012-to-2016 \n\n2\n\nLEX3070 Released Document No. 6Released under the Freedom of Information Act 19829\n\n\n--- Page 3 ---\n\n1. \n\n2. \n\n3. \n\n4. \n\n5. \n\n6. \n\n7. \n\n8. \n\n9. \n\n10. \n\n11. \n\n12. \n\n13. \n\n14. \n\n15. \n\n16. \n\n17. \n\n18. \n\n19. \n\n20. \n\n21. \n\n22. \n\n23. \n\n24. \n\n25. \n\n26. \n\n27. \n\n28. \n\n29. \n\nREDACTION CODES \n\nPersonal Information (name) redacted. \n\nPersonal Information (date of birth) redacted. \n\nPersonal Information (place of birth) redacted \n\nPersonal Information (citizenship) redacted. \n\nPersonal Information (racial or ethnic origin) redacted. \n\nPersonal Information (photograph) redacted \n\nPersonal Information (facsimile of signature) redacted. \n\nPersonal Information (facsimile of manuscript initialling) redacted. \n\nPersonal Information (Individual’s address) redacted. \n\nPersonal Information (Individual’s email address) redacted. \n\nPersonal Information (individual’s telephone number or mobile number) \nredacted. \n\nPersonal Information (individual’s political opinion) redacted. \n\nPersonal Information (opinion about individual) redacted. \n\nPersonal Information (Individuals current or former occupation). \n\nPersonal Information (employment history) redacted. \n\nPersonal Information (qualifications) redacted. \n\nPersonal Information (membership of a professional or trade association). \n\nPersonal Information (membership of a trade union). \n\nPersonal Information (health) redacted. \n\nPersonal Information (membership of a political association) redacted \n\nPersonal Information (religious beliefs or affiliations) redacted. \n\nPersonal Information (sexual orientation or practices). \n\nPersonal Information (criminal record). \n\nPersonal Information (identifying individual) redacted. \n\nPersonal Information (bank account details) redacted) \n\nBusiness information (bank account details) redacted. \n\nBusiness information (billing account details) redacted. \n\nBusiness information (ureasonably affect a person adversely in respect of his \nor her lawful business or professional affairs) redacted. \n\nBusiness Information (reasonably be expected to prejudice the future supply \nof information to the Commonwealth or an agency for the purpose of the \nadministration of a law of the Commonwealth or of a Territory or the \nadministration of matters administered by an agency). \n\n30. \n\nBusiness information (trade secret).\n\n\n--- Page 4 ---\n\n31. \n\n32. \n\n33. \n\n34. \n\n35. \n\n36. \n\n37. \n\n38. \n\nBusiness information (information having a commercial value that would be, \nor could reasonably be expected to be, destroyed or diminished if the \ninformation were disclosed). \n\nLegal Professional Communication redacted. \n\nDeliberative material redacted. \n\nElectoral Roll material redacted. \n\nTests, examinations or audits material redacted. \n\nManagement or assessment of personnel material redacted. \n\nProper and efficient conduct of the operations of AEC material redacted. \n\nLawful methods or procedures for preventing, detecting, investigating, or \ndealing with matters arising out of, breaches or evasions of the law redactged \n\n39. \n\nIrrelevant material redacted.\n\n"
