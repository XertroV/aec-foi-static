Key discussions involved:\n\n*   **Membership Testing Methodology:** The Commission, with input from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS), discussed and endorsed a proposed methodology for testing membership lists of non-parliamentary parties, an extension of the existing approach. They requested additional statistical advice from the ABS to refine parameters, ensuring a low probability of incorrectly accepting invalid or rejecting valid membership lists.\n*   **Political Party Register Review:** The Commission decided to initiate a review of the register of non-parliamentary parties. This involved providing notices under section 138A of the *Electoral Act* to each party, requiring them to provide information by December 2, 2021, to demonstrate they meet the new 1,500 membership eligibility requirement.\n\n### Relevance to FOI Request:\n\nThis document is highly relevant to the FOI request as it directly addresses key areas specified:\n\n*   **Evolving Methodology for Membership Verification:** It details the AEC's immediate response to the legislative amendments, specifically outlining the proposed and endorsed methodology for verifying the increased 1,500-member requirement.\n*   **ABS Advice on Membership Testing:** The minutes explicitly show the AEC seeking and receiving advice from the ABS regarding statistical parameters for membership testing, which is a core component mentioned in the FOI request overview.\n*   **Party Registration/Deregistration Processes:** The decision to conduct a comprehensive review of the non-parliamentary party register, requiring parties to prove their 1,500-member eligibility, directly pertains to the AEC's processes for maintaining party registration and potential deregistration if requirements are not met.\n*   **Legislative Amendments:** The entire meeting's focus is a direct consequence of the *Electoral Legislation Amendment (Party Registration Integrity) Act 2021*, which is central to the FOI request's context."

These documents primarily detail the Commission's decisions and discussions concerning political party registration, deregistration, and name changes, alongside the evolving methodology for verifying party membership, particularly in response to legislative amendments increasing the minimum member requirement from 500 to 1,500. Key discussions included seeking Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) advice on membership testing, and specific rulings on party names (e.g., \"The New Liberals,\" \"Liberal Democratic Party\"), deregistration (e.g., \"Australian People’s Party,\" \"VOTEFLUX.ORG\"), and re-registration (e.g., \"Seniors United Party of Australia\").\n [REQUEST OVERVIEW END] \n\n--- MAIN DOCUMENT TEXT START ---\n\n\n\n--- Page 1 ---\n\nMinutes \n\nAustralian Electoral Commission \nMeeting No. 274 \n\nDate: Wednesday 6 October 2021  Time: 4:00pm  Location: Microsoft Teams \n\nAttendees:  \nThe Hon.
