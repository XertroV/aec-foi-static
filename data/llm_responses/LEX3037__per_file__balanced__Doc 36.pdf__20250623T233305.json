The email requests the swift removal of a TikTok video that recorded an AEC staff member without their awareness or consent inside a counting centre. The request cites a breach of privacy rules and the identification of AEC staff as reasons for removal.\n\n### Relevance to FOI Request LEX3037\n\nThis document is highly relevant to FOI request LEX3037 as it exemplifies the direct engagement and communication channels established between the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) and major tech companies, specifically TikTok, during the 2022 federal election period. It demonstrates the AEC's proactive efforts, likely through its Electoral Integrity Assurance Taskforce, to address \"non-compliant content\" on social media platforms. While the specific issue is a privacy breach and unauthorized recording of staff rather than misinformation, it falls under the broader remit of safeguarding election integrity by managing content that impacts AEC operations and personnel. This aligns with the FOI request's description of AEC's collaboration with platforms for content referrals and direct communication to maintain election integrity.\n```"
