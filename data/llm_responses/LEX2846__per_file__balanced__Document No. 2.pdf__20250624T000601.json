It clarifies that telephone voting is an emergency measure for eligible individuals who test positive for COVID-19 after 6 pm on the Tuesday before polling day, requiring registered positive test results with state/territory health authorities. For earlier diagnoses, applying for a postal vote is recommended, illustrating the AEC's **adapted postal voting policy**.\n\nThe document outlines the voter's \"Customer Journey,\" including online registration, receiving a unique registration number, and encouraging voters to view ballot papers online before calling to reduce wait times. It also details the communication strategy to inform COVID-19 positive individuals about the service.\n\nSignificant **logistical challenges** are implied through the mention of \"likely long wait times,\" the \"significant delivery scale\" stood up in a short timeframe, and the deployment of approximately 7,000 operators for the service, suggesting the kind of staffing difficulties and operational pressures the AEC faced and the potential **financial challenges** from such rapid scaling. The document also reinforces **COVID-safe measures** at polling places by encouraging in-person voting for those able, including close contacts.\n\nA primary focus is on maintaining the **integrity of new voting methods**. The document emphasizes mechanisms to prevent double voting (real-time roll mark-off, voter declarations), details AEC-developed, robust procedures for call centre operations (even when using non-AEC staff), requires staff to sign **Political Neutrality disclosures**, and confirms the crucial role of **scrutineer observation** for all stages, from the telephone call process to secure ballot paper handling and counting. These measures underscore the AEC's commitment to robust complaint mechanisms and transparency in the new system."

  "prompt": "Considering this document as part of an FOI request, summarize the document and its relevance to the FOI request in markdown format. Provide only the markdown formatted summary text. Do not include any conversational filler or preamble.To aid you, the overview of the FOI request is: [REQUEST OVERVIEW START] The FOI request LEX2846 illuminated the Australian Electoral Commission's (AEC) extensive preparations for conducting federal elections amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. Released documents detailed the **Commonwealth Electoral (COVID Enfranchisement) Regulations 2022**, establishing a secure telephone voting system for eligible self-isolating voters diagnosed close to polling day, supported by detailed \"Customer Journey\" plans and staff scripts. The AEC also adapted its **postal voting policy** for COVID-positive individuals and noted reduced mobile polling. Revealed were significant **logistical and financial challenges**, including projected cost increases and staffing difficulties, prompting the AEC to seek greater legislative flexibility for emergency election management. The AEC ensured **COVID-safe measures** at polling places and maintained the integrity of new voting methods through staff neutrality, scrutineer observation, and robust complaint mechanisms.\n [REQUEST OVERVIEW END] \n\n--- MAIN DOCUMENT TEXT START ---\n\n\n\n--- Page 1 ---\n\nMedia responses – secure telephone voting \n\nTopline talking points \n\n•  Telephone voting has been introduced as an emergency measure and is strictly only for \n\npeople who have tested positive to COVID after 6pm on the Tuesday evening before polling \nday.  \n\n• \n\nIt will be available from 8.30am Thursday 19 May. \n\n•  People who tested positive from Saturday 14 May until then should apply for a postal vote.  \n\n•  To access the service electors must prove their eligibility and must have registered their \n\npositive COVID-19 test – either a PCR or RAT – with their state or territory health authority.  \nThis is a mandatory requirement. \n\n• \n\nImages of the ballot papers will be available for voters to view on the AEC website, to ensure \nthose voting by telephone are able to complete the process as easily as possible. \n\n•  Voter verification will work the same for telephone voting as any other method – voters will \nnot be required to present identification in order to have their vote marked against the \nelectoral roll. Voters will be making a legal declaration about their identity, as they do when \nvoting in person or by post, and that they have not previously voted in this election.  \n\n•  Previously, telephone voting was limited to voters who are blind or have low vision with just \n\nover 2,000 votes taken via telephone in 2019.  \n\n• \n\nIt is an emergency measure only and there will likely be long wait times to vote with this \nservice.   \n\n•  Anyone who is able to visit a polling place should do so. There are more COVID-19 safety \nmeasures in place than your trip to the local shops – so you can feel safe to turn up and \nvote.  \n\nHow secure telephone voting works \n\nHow will telephone voting work? \n\nThere’s two steps for secure telephone voting. \n\nFirst, people register to use the service on the AEC website. Voters will need to provide \nevidence of being COVID-19 positive and make a declaration about their eligibility.  \n\nOnce the registration form has been submitted, people will get a registration number sent by \nSMS or email. When they call to cast their vote, people will quote this registration number \nrather than their name and address to protect the secrecy of their vote. \n\nIf people don’t have internet access, they can register over the phone. But we expect the vast \nmajority to register online. \n\nWe’re asking people to visit the AEC website and look at an image of the ballot papers and \nconsider their preferences before calling to vote. This will help make the voting process quicker \nand reduce wait times for the service. \n\nThen they will call 1800 413 960. They quote their registration number and a call centre \noperator will record the vote. \n\nHow do people prove they’re COVID-19 positive? \n\nPeople can only use the telephone voting service if they have registered their positive COVID-19 \ntest – either a PCR or RAT – with their state or territory health authority. They’ll also need to \nprovide evidence of their PCR, such as date and time of positive test result, or evidence of their \nRAT, such as serial number.\n\n\n--- Page 2 ---\n\nHow can close contacts vote? \n\nClose contacts no longer need to isolate. This means they can attend a polling place to vote in \nperson. We expect they will follow local health authority guidelines and take appropriate \nCOVID-19 safety measures. \n\nWhat happens if a close contact has COVID-19 symptoms? \n\nThe AEC is recommending people plan their vote. If people don’t think they will be able to \nvote in person on election day, they may be eligible to apply for a postal vote or attend one of \nour early voting centres. If a family member has COVID-19 in the week before the election, \nclose contacts may consider voting early in case they become symptomatic. \n\nHow will COVID-19 positive people know about the service? \n\nThe AEC is running a voter services campaign, which explains to people their voting options if \nthey don’t think they will be able to vote in person on election day. This is available in up to 33 \nlanguages. \n\nIn addition, everyone who registers a positive COVID-19 test result with their state or territory \ngovernment will receive information on how to vote while in isolation. State and territory \nCOVID-19 web pages and call centres will also direct people to the AEC website to check their \nvoting options. \n\nWhat are the operating hours? \n\nOnline registration  \nOpens \nCloses \nPhone registration \n\nPhone voting  \n\nWednesday 18 May  \nSaturday 21 May  \nThursday 19 May   \nFriday 20 May \nSaturday 21 May \nThursday 19 May \nFriday 20 May \nSaturday 21 May \n\n6.01pm AEST  \n4pm AEST \n8.30am to 5.30pm local time \n8.30am to 5.30pm local time \n8am local time to 4pm AEST \n8.30am to 5.30pm local time \n8.30am to 6pm local time \n8am to 6pm local time \n\nIf a registered COVID-19 positive telephone voter is on the line when voting closes at 6pm on \nelection day they will be able to cast their vote, just as is the case for people in the queue at \n6pm at an election day polling place.  \n\nIntegrity of the service \n\nDoes this open up the possibility of people voting twice? \n\nNo. As part of the registration process, the voter’s name will be marked off the roll in real time. \nIf the voter has already voted they will not be able to register. \n\nVoters also have to make a declaration when they call to vote that they haven’t voted before in \nthis election. \n\nHow is the AEC ensuring electoral integrity given there will be non-AEC call centres taking votes? \n\nAll policies, procedures and training materials have been developed by the AEC in line with \nour existing election and call centre management procedures. As you’d expect, they’re \nstandardised, robust, and align with the electronically assisted voting provisions in the \nElectoral Act. \n\nIf pushed \nAll staff working on the call centre are employees of the Australia Public Service and have \nundertaken specific training for this service. They also must have signed a Political Neutrality \ndisclosure, and there are offences in the Regulation and lawful declarations that the elector \nneeds to make. Any breach is a criminal offence.\n\n\n--- Page 3 ---\n\nHow is the service scrutineered? \n\nCandidates and party-appointed scrutineers can observe the telephone voting process, as is the \ncase with every voting process we deliver. This is an important part of the transparency of \nAustralia’s election delivery. Voters can request a scrutineer not to observe their phone call, if \nthat’s their preference. \n\nThe ballot paper handling requirements in call centres will be subject to the same stringent \nballot paper handling and reconciliation requirements as in-person polling places.  \n\nVotes will only be counted following secure return to the relevant divisional offices, which is \nalso conducted under scrutineer observation. \n\nHow will the secure telephone votes be counted? \n\nAfter the close of voting on election day, all the envelopes will be sorted, reconciled and \npacked for secure dispatch to their home division. There, they’ll be receipted, opened and the \nballot papers counted. \n\nOperation of the service \n\nWho is delivering the call centre? \n\nThe secure telephone voting service is being managed by the Australian Electoral Commission, \nusing a number of Commonwealth department call centres.  \n\nOperators, like all people involved in the delivery of the election, are required to sign a political \nneutrality declaration – a statement that they will undertake their duties with impartiality.  \n\nHow many people do you think will cast a vote by phone? \n\nCOVID-19 case numbers continue to fluctuate. We’re working closely with the Department of \nHealth to model expected demand.  \n\nIf pushed \n\nThe one thing we know is that COVID-19 is unpredictable. In saying that, if people are tracking \nthe number of daily COVID-positive case numbers this should give them an idea of the number \nof calls we’re expecting.  \n\nWhile experts are predicting numbers to plateau, we’re building a service that will cater for \nabove the expected demand, so that there’s coverage if a new variant emerges or numbers \nunexpectedly rise in the week prior to the election. \n\nIf further pushed \n\nWe’ll have approximately 7000 operators for this service. While a significant delivery scale has \nbeen stood up in a short time frame, we’ve been very upfront that the nature of the service \nwill mean people may experience a wait.  \n\nHow many how people voted by phone? \n\n(From Sunday) XX people registered to vote by phone. We’re still reconciling how many then \ncalled to cast their vote by phone. \n\nLast updated: 11 May 2022 \n\nClearance: Kath Gleeson\n\n"
