            "text": "The document is a letter from the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) to an individual, informing them that their request for a review of the decision to deregister VOTEFLUX.ORG | Upgrade Democracy! (VFUD) has been denied. The AEC's rationale for refusal is that the individual is not a \"person affected by\" the delegate’s decision within the meaning of section 141(2) of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918, despite acknowledging the individual's dissatisfaction. The letter notes that other individuals *were* deemed \"persons affected\" and are proceeding with reviews. It then outlines the individual's right to seek a further review from the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT), detailing the application process, fees, and timelines.\n\nWithin the context of the FOI request overview, this document exemplifies government overreach by imposing procedural hurdles that restrict an individual's capacity to challenge what is perceived as an arbitrary and unjust government action. The overview argues the AEC's actions against VOTEFLUX assaulted individual rights, rational self-interest, and productive achievement, and this document shows a further layer of bureaucratic obstruction to seeking redress.\n\n**Analysis from an Objectivist Perspective:**\n\n*   **Reason:** The document contradicts the value of reason by substituting an arbitrary, undefined bureaucratic standard (\"person affected\") for objective reality. While acknowledging the individual's \"dissatisfaction\" (para 12) and their explicit reasoning—that VFUD's deregistration was \"unfair/unjust\" and that the party \"pose[s] a plausible attempt at contesting the status quo and creating a better life for all Australians\" (para 4)—the AEC dismisses this as insufficient grounds for standing. This disjunction between a clear, stated personal impact and the AEC’s narrow interpretation demonstrates a disregard for the rational connection between government action and its effect on a citizen's pursuit of a better life. The AEC's statement that \"the term 'person affected' is not defined in the Electoral Act and has not received judicial consideration in the context of electoral law\" (para 13) yet still applies a restrictive interpretation from \"other contexts\" highlights the reliance on an arbitrary, subjective standard rather than objective, demonstrable impact.\n\n*   **Individualism:** This document directly assaults individualism by subordinating the individual's expressed interest and right to political participation to a bureaucratic interpretation of legal standing. By determining that an individual is not \"affected\" simply as an \"elector enrolled on the Commonwealth Electoral Roll or a member of the Australian general public\" (para 15), the AEC dismisses the individual as a sovereign citizen whose political choices and capacity to support a party for \"a better life for all Australians\" are directly impacted by government decisions. This interpretation limits individual agency, placing administrative convenience and statutory definitions above the concrete, rational self-interest of a citizen seeking to engage politically. The fact that \"two other individuals\" were accepted as \"persons affected\" (para 17) underscores the arbitrary nature of the distinction, indicating that some \"particular connection\" deemed acceptable by the bureaucracy is required, rather than an objective assessment of impact on the individual's stated values and goals.\n\n*   **Free Enterprise:** While not directly about economic transactions, the principles of free enterprise extend to the freedom of association and the ability to engage in productive social and political endeavors. VOTEFLUX's efforts to accrue members and challenge the status quo are described as \"productive achievement\" in the FOI overview. This document, by creating a procedural barrier for an individual to challenge the deregistration of a political party they support, indirectly obstructs the free association and political participation that are analogous to free enterprise in the political sphere. It makes it harder for individuals to support and defend productive political endeavors, thereby stifling innovation and competition in the political market.\n\n**Evidence of Bureaucratic Obstacles, Forced Altruism, or Suppression of Productive Achievement:**\n\n*   **Bureaucratic Obstacles:**\n    *   **Arbitrary Standing:** The primary obstacle is the AEC's arbitrary and narrow interpretation of \"person affected\" (paras 12, 15), denying the individual the right to review despite their stated dissatisfaction and clear reasons for feeling impacted. This procedural hurdle adds an unnecessary layer of complexity and cost to seeking justice.\n    *   **Procedural Delay:** The note that \"no action could lawfully be undertaken regarding your application from 11 April 2022... until writs were returned on 23 June 2022\" (para 5) illustrates how external bureaucratic processes can impose significant, unavoidable delays on an individual's attempt to obtain redress.\n    *   **Financial Barrier to Justice:** The requirement of a $962 (standard) or $100 (reduced) fee to appeal the AEC's decision to the AAT (Page 6) constitutes a financial barrier. This elevates \"administrative convenience\" (cost recovery for the AAT) over the individual's ability to seek a just outcome, effectively monetizing the pursuit of legal redress against government action.\n\n*   **Forced Altruism:** The dismissal of an individual's concern as an \"elector or member of the Australian general public\" (para 15) implicitly pushes the individual to accept the AEC's arbitrary definitions and limitations, even if it means sacrificing their ability to actively support a political party aligned with their rational self-interest. It forces the individual to passively accept a bureaucratic decision that they perceive as unjust, rather than allowing them to act on their conviction for a \"better life for all Australians\" (para 4) through the political process.\n\n*   **Suppression of Productive Achievement:** By denying an individual the standing to challenge the deregistration of a party they explicitly support for \"creating a better life for all Australians\" (para 4), the AEC inhibits the individual's engagement in productive political action and stifles the efforts of parties like VOTEFLUX to innovate and \"Upgrade Democracy!\" The cumulative effect of such bureaucratic hurdles is to discourage individuals from investing time and effort in political movements and to make it easier for the state to suppress non-conforming or innovative political efforts, thereby undermining the free pursuit of productive achievement in the political sphere."

Analyze how the document reflects or contradicts the values of reason, individualism, and free enterprise. Note any evidence of bureaucratic obstacles, forced altruism, or suppression of productive achievement.\n\nTo aid you, the overview of the FOI request is: [REQUEST OVERVIEW START] The Australian Electoral Commission's (AEC) actions against VOTEFLUX.ORG | Upgrade Democracy! represent a stark Objectivist condemnation of government overreach, directly assaulting individual rights, rational self-interest, and productive achievement. The AEC's use of a demonstrably flawed and irrational membership testing methodology, despite internal expert admission of its statistical invalidity, constitutes a profound disregard for objective reality and reason—foundations essential for personal freedom and a just society. By arbitrarily limiting and rejecting VOTEFLUX's significant productive efforts in accruing members, the AEC actively suppresses individual initiative and disincentivizes rational self-interest, effectively punishing excellence and forcing stagnation under the guise of bureaucratic \"convenience.\" This prioritization of administrative \"costs\" over truth and liberty exemplifies the dangers of collectivism, where the individual is sacrificed for the arbitrary will of the state, thereby stifling the free association and productive endeavors of citizens and undermining the proper role of government as a protector of rights.\n [REQUEST OVERVIEW END] \n\n--- MAIN DOCUMENT TEXT START ---\n\n\n\n--- Page 1 ---\n\nDocument No 30\n\nAEC reference: LEX1984 \n\nBy email: \n\nDear \n\nRequest for review of decision under s 141 of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 \n\n1.\n\n2.\n\nThe Australian Electoral Commission (‘the Commission’) refers to your email dated\n6 May 2022, in which you requested that the Commission review the delegate’s\ndecision to deregister VOTEFLUX.ORG | Upgrade Democracy! (VFUD) under\nsection 137(6) of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 (‘Electoral Act’).\n\nThis letter is to notify you that the Commission has decided that it is unable to review\nthe delegate’s decision at your request.\n\nYour application \n\n3.\n\n4.\n\n5.\n\nOn 6 May 2022, the Commission Secretariat received an email from you, requesting\na review of the delegate’s decision to deregister VFUD under section 137(6) of the\nElectoral Act (‘delegate’s decision’).\n\nIn your email, you stated that you were linked to an article on VFUD’s website “via\none of their communication channels: https://www.voteflux.org/2022/04/20/wrongful-\nderegistration/” and agreed with the reasoning in that article for VFUD’s belief that\n“their deregistration was unfair/unjust”. You also stated that “there is no reason not to\npoll the list of active memberships extensively to reach the firmest result” and that\nVFUD “pose a plausible attempt at contesting the status quo and creating a better life\nfor all Australians”.\n\nThe Commission notes that no action could lawfully be undertaken regarding your\napplication from 11 April 2022 when the writs were issued for the recent federal\nelection until writs were returned on 23 June 2022.\n\nPage 1 \n\ns 47F (Personal Privacy)s 47F (Personal Privacy)s 47F (Personal Privacy)s 47F (Personal Privacy)\n\n\n--- Page 2 ---\n\nDecision \n\n6. \n\nThe Commission has considered your request and has decided that the Commission \nis unable to review the delegate’s decision at your request, because you are not a \nperson “affected by” the delegate’s decision within the meaning of section 141(2) of \nthe Electoral Act.  \n\nMaterial taken into account \n\n7. \n\nIn making this decision, the Commission has had regard to the material before it, \nincluding: \n\n(a)  your email dated 6 May 2022 requesting a review of the delegate’s decision;  \n\n(b)  the delegate’s decision and notice dated 24 March 2022 setting out her \n\nreasons for that decision; \n\n(c) the material and other information before the delegate in making the \n\ndelegate’s decision, including the list of 1,649 names provided by VFUD on \n7 December 2021 (7 December 2021 list); the list of 4,680 names provided \nby VFUD under cover of a letter dated 13 February 2022 (13 February 2022 \nlist); and the results of membership testing of the 7 December 2021 list and \nthe 13 February 2022 list set out at [16]-[24] of the delegate’s reasons for \ndecision; \n\n(d) correspondence between the Commission Secretariat and you, including the \nemails sent by the Commission Secretariat to you dated 24 June 2022 and \n4 July 2022; \n\n(e)  Part XI of the Electoral Act, in particular section 141.  \n\nSection 141 of the Electoral Act  \n\n8. \n\nSection 141(2) of the Electoral Act provides for making an application to the \nCommission for review of a “reviewable decision”. A decision to deregister a political \nparty under s 137(6) of the Electoral Act is a “reviewable decision”. \n\n9. \n\nSections 141(2) and 141(3) of the Electoral Act require the application: \n\n• be in writing; \n• be made to the Commission; \n• specify an address of the applicant; and  \n• include reasons for making the application.  \n\nYour request for review met these requirements. \n\nPage 2\n\n\n--- Page 3 ---\n\n10. \n\nIn addition, section 141(2) provides that an application can only be made: \n\n• by a person affected by the decision who is dissatisfied with the \n\ndecision; and \n\n• within the period of 28 days after the day on which the decision first \n\ncomes to the notice of the person, or within such further period as the \nCommission (either before or after the expiration of that period) \nallows. \n\n11. \n\nBy an email dated 24 June 2022, the Commission Secretariat advised you that the \nwrit for the recent election had been returned; that the Commission was therefore \nable to process your request; and that if you wished to submit an updated application \nor additional material, you were able to do so. By a further email dated 4 July 2022, \nthe Commission Secretariat specifically referred to the statutory requirements in \nsection 141(2) and invited you to provide such further submissions or comments as \nyou wished. The Commission notes that the Commission Secretariat received no \nresponse to its emails of 24 June 2022 and 4 July 2022. \n\n12.  On the material before it, the Commission is not satisfied that you are a person \n\n“affected by” the decision within the meaning of section 141(2) of the Electoral Act, \nalthough it accepts that you are dissatisfied with that decision. \n\n13. \n\n14. \n\n15. \n\nThe term “person affected” is not defined in the Electoral Act and has not received \njudicial consideration in the context of electoral law. Judicial consideration of the term \nin other contexts indicates that the meaning of the term in section 141(2) of the \nElectoral Act is referable to Part XI of the Electoral Act, having regard to the subject, \nscope and purpose of the Act as a whole. \n\nYour email of 6 May 2022 shows that you are dissatisfied with the delegate’s decision \nto deregister VFUD under section 137(6) of the Electoral Act, but this does not \nestablish that you are a person “affected by” the delegate’s decision within the \nmeaning of section 141(2) of the Electoral Act. \n\nThe Commission is of the view that a person is not “affected by” a decision to which \nsection 141(2) applies simply because the person is an elector enrolled on the \nCommonwealth Electoral Roll or a member of the Australian general public. The \nmaterial before the Commission does not indicate that you have any particular \nconnection to the delegate’s decision or to VFUD (for example, as a member of the \nParty). This material does not indicate that the delegate’s decision would have any \nparticular consequence for you other than as an elector or member of the public. \nHaving regard to the terms of section 141(2), Part XI of the Electoral Act and the Act \nas a whole, the Commission has concluded that this is not sufficient to make you a \nperson “affected by” the delegate’s decision for the purpose of section 141(2) of the \nElectoral Act.  \n\nPage 3\n\n\n--- Page 4 ---\n\n16. \n\n17. \n\nAccordingly, the Commission is of the view that you are not a “person affected” by \nthe delegate’s decision to deregister VFUD under section 137(6) of the Electoral Act \nand that you are therefore not eligible to apply for a review of that decision under \nsection 141 of the Electoral Act. \n\nOther matters \n\nThe Commission notes that the Commission Secretariat has received other \napplications for review of the delegate’s decision to deregister VFUD from two other \nindividuals who contest the delegate’s decision for the same or similar reasons to \nyour own. The Commission accepts that these individuals are “persons affected” by \nthe delegate’s decision and otherwise eligible to apply for a review of the delegate’s \ndecision. The Commission proposes to publish the outcome of its review of the \ndelegate’s decision on the AEC website. \n\nStatement of review rights \n\n18. \n\nA statement of review rights in respect of this decision is enclosed.  \n\nPage 4\n\n\n--- Page 5 ---\n\nYours sincerely, \n\nThe Hon Justice Susan Kenny AM  \n\nChairperson \n\nSeptember 2022 \n\nMr Tom Rogers \n\nElectoral Commissioner \n\nSeptember 2022 \n\nDr David Gruen AO \n\nAustralian Statistician  \n(non-judicial member) \n\nSeptember 2022 \n\nPage 5\n\n\n--- Page 6 ---\n\nYour review rights \n\nUnder s 141(5) of the Electoral Act, a person (including an organisation) affected by the \nCommission’s decision who is dissatisfied with the decision may make an application to the \nAdministrative Appeals Tribunal (‘the AAT’) for review of the decision.  \n\nHow is an application made to the AAT for a review of a Commission decision? \n\nIn accordance with s 29 of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975, the application \nmust: \n\n(a)  be made in writing; \n\n(b)  be accompanied by any prescribed fee; \n\n(c)  contain a statement of reasons for the application; and  \n\n(d)  be made within the prescribed time. \n\nThe application should also: \n\n(a)  specify the name of the applicant; and \n\n(b)  include an address at which documents in relation to the AAT proceedings \n\nmay be given.  \n\nMore information on how to apply to the AAT can be found on the AAT website: \nhttps://www.aat.gov.au/apply-for-a-review.    \n\nPrescribed fee \n\nThe AAT’s standard application fee is $962.
