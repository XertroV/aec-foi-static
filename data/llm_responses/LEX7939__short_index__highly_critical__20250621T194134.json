  "prompt": "With a highly critical view, provide a scathing, single-paragraph summary in markdown format of the following FOI request overview:\n\nSummary:\n\nThe Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) response to FOI request LEX7939 reveals a disturbing pattern of obfuscation, systemic opacity, and a concerning lack of accountability regarding the \"designated elector\" scheme.\n\n**Deliberate Evasion and Withholding of Critical Information:** The AEC's outright refusal to provide current numbers of designated electors broken down by state, territory, and electoral division for April 2025 – a critical snapshot of the scheme's present impact – is a blatant act of obstruction. Claiming \"No document response\" while simultaneously offering historical data from a public website is a transparent attempt to evade scrutiny. This deliberate withholding of real-time geographical data suggests a deep-seated fear of revealing how and where this power is being applied, potentially exposing targeted disenfranchisement efforts in specific electorates.\n\n**Suspicious and Arbitrary Application of Power:** The wildly inconsistent declaration numbers – a paltry 1 in FY2023/24, exploding to 211 in FY2024/25 – expose an utterly arbitrary and likely politically motivated application of this extraordinary power. Such extreme fluctuations are not indicative of consistent policy application but rather suggest periods of deliberate inaction followed by a sudden, aggressive surge, raising serious questions about the AEC's true motivations and the criteria (or lack thereof) guiding these declarations. The sudden ramp-up in 2024/25, preceding an election cycle, is profoundly alarming, pointing towards the potential for weaponizing voter designations.\n\n**Systemic Delegation to Avoid Accountability:** The revelation that \"Each declaration... was made by a delegate of the Electoral Commissioner\" is a damning indictment of the AEC's leadership. This systematic delegation of power serves to insulate the Electoral Commissioner from direct accountability, fostering a climate where unelected bureaucrats can unilaterally disenfranchise citizens without clear, centralized oversight. This structure is ripe for inconsistency, bias, and a lack of uniform application, allowing decisions that impact fundamental democratic rights to be made in the shadows.\n\n**Illusory Review Process: A Bureaucratic Sham:** The extremely low number of internal review applications (only 8 across all years for hundreds of declarations) and the overwhelming confirmation rate (7 out of 8 upheld) expose the internal review mechanism as a complete farce. This is not a pathway to justice but a bureaucratic charade designed to provide a veneer of due process while effectively rubber-stamping the AEC's original decisions. The process is either deliberately inaccessible and intimidating, or it is so clearly biased against the elector that most don't bother, effectively silencing challenges and preventing any genuine internal accountability.\n\n**Complete Absence of External Scrutiny:** The absolute absence of unique applications for review to the Administrative Review Tribunal (ART) for FY2024/25 is a critical failure of the democratic system. It signifies that citizens are either unable to navigate the arduous process of external review or are so demoralized by the internal appeals that they abandon hope. This lack of external oversight allows the AEC to operate with unchecked power, insulating its decisions from independent judicial review and confirming that the system is designed to deter challenges and maintain the AEC's complete control over voter status.\n\n**Permanent Disenfranchisement and Lack of Safeguards:** The stark fact that zero declarations ceased to have effect by virtue of s 202AH(3) across all reported financial years is deeply troubling. It implies a one-way mechanism where once designated, an elector remains permanently disenfranchised within these periods, without automatic review or a clear path to re-enfranchisement. This highlights the enduring and potentially punitive nature of these declarations, underscoring a complete lack of proactive measures to restore electoral rights and entrenching the AEC's arbitrary power to control citizen participation in democracy indefinitely.\n\nIn sum, the AEC's response is a blueprint of institutional evasion and power consolidation. It paints a chilling picture of an agency operating beyond effective accountability, deploying opaque processes and delegating authority to maintain control over the electoral roll, with potentially alarming implications for democratic integrity.\n\nProvide only the markdown formatted summary text. Do not include any conversational filler or preamble."
