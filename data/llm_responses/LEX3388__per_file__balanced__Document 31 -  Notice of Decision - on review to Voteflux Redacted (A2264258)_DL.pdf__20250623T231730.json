(VFUD) under section 141(4)(a) of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918, following applications for internal review.\n\n**Summary of the Document:**\nThe AEC Commission considered VFUD's arguments, which included claims that VFUD met the 1,500-member threshold (submitting a list of 4,680 names), that the AEC's statistical testing methodology was flawed, and that the delegate's non-random selection of 1,650 names from VFUD's 4,680-member list for testing was procedurally unfair and invalidated the results.\n\nThe Commission affirmed the deregistration. Critically, it acknowledged that the delegate's action of taking the \"top 1,650 names\" from the 4,680-member list for testing was a \"departure from the methodology\" and, consequently, the Commission placed \"no weight on its results.\" However, the Commission rejected VFUD's submission that merely providing a list of 4,680 names was sufficient evidence of meeting the membership threshold without proper testing. The Commission upheld its standard membership testing methodology as appropriate and rejected VFUD's criticisms regarding filtering, procedural fairness (e.g., not providing individual test outcomes), and alternative testing proposals. The affirmation of the delegate's decision implies reliance on the definitive failure of VFUD's initial membership test (7 December 2021 list) and VFUD's subsequent inability to provide a properly testable list conforming to the AEC's established methodology.\n\n**Relevance to the FOI Request:**\nThis document is the core internal review decision described in the FOI request overview. It directly addresses the key elements of the request, including:\n*   The AEC Commission's affirmation of VFUD's deregistration.\n*   The explicit acknowledgment by the AEC that the delegate's non-random testing of the second (4,680-member) list was a \"departure from the methodology\" and that \"no weight\" was placed on its results.\n*   The AEC's rationale for still upholding the deregistration, which rests on the party's failure to provide a properly testable list within the AEC's methodology, implicitly confirming the original deregistration based on the definitive failure of the first membership test and the inadequacy of subsequent submissions."

Do not include any conversational filler or preamble.To aid you, the overview of the FOI request is: [REQUEST OVERVIEW START] The FOI request concerned the deregistration of the political party VOTEFLUX.ORG | Upgrade Democracy! (VFUD) by the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) for failing to meet the mandatory 1,500-member threshold. This decision stemmed from VFUD's submitted membership lists failing the AEC's statistical testing methodology, which the party contended was fundamentally flawed, particularly after a procedural error saw the delegate non-randomly test only 1,650 names from a larger 4,680-member list. During the subsequent internal review, the AEC Commission affirmed the deregistration, critically acknowledging that the delegate's non-random testing of the second list was a \"departure from the methodology\" and placed \"no weight\" on its results. However, the deregistration was upheld based on the definitive failure of VFUD's *first* membership test and the party's subsequent failure to provide a properly testable list within the AEC's established, resource-constrained methodology.\n [REQUEST OVERVIEW END] \n\n--- MAIN DOCUMENT TEXT START ---\n\n\n\n--- Page 1 ---\n\nDocument No 31 \n\nAEC reference: LEX1994 \n\nBy email: \n\nBy email: \n\nDear \n\n and \n\nReview of decision under s 141(4) of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 – notice of decision \nunder s 141(7) \n\n1.\n\n2.\n\n3.\n\n and \n\nThe Australian Electoral Commission (the Commission) refers to the written applications\nmade by \nrespectively (applications for review), for review of the delegate’s decision to deregister\nVOTEFLUX.ORG | Upgrade Democracy!

\n\n(b)  the delegate’s decision made under section 137(6)(a) of the Electoral Act to deregister \nVFUD, with the notice of the reasons for the decision under section 137(6)(b) of the \nElectoral Act dated 24 March 2022 (reasons for decision); \n\n(c)  the material and other information before the delegate in making the delegate’s \n\ndecision, including the list of 1,649 names provided by VFUD on 7 December 2021 \n(7 December 2021 list); the list of 4,680 names provided by VFUD under cover of a \nletter dated 13 February 2022 (13 February 2022 list); and the results of membership \ntesting of the 7 December 2021 list and the 13 February 2022 list set out at [16]-[24] of \nthe delegate’s reasons for decision; \n\n(d)  correspondence between the Commission Secretariat and VFUD’s Registered Officer \n\n(\n\n relating to the Commission’s review of the delegate’s decision;  \n\n(e)  the methodology for testing membership lists as outlined in the AEC’s Party \n\nRegistration Guide and published on its website (Methodology); \n\n(f)  Part XI of the Electoral Act. \n\nMr Kaye’s submissions \n\n7. \n\nIn summary, in support of his application for review, \n\n submitted that: \n\n(a)  VFUD has at least 1,500 members, as VFUD submitted a membership list of 4,680 \n\nnames to the Commission; \n\n(b)  the Methodology is an invalid means of testing whether a political party, not being a \n\nParliamentary party, has “at least 1,500 members” for the purposes of section 137 of \nthe Electoral Act, because the Methodology involves testing only a sample of the \nnames on a party membership list limited to 1,500 – 1,650 names;  \n\n(c)  the Methodology erroneously assumes that a membership list limited in this way is an \n\nexhaustive list of the relevant party’s members; \n\n(d)  the Methodology may lead to a high probability of rejecting a valid list in some \n\ncircumstances, and in the case of VFUD, the methodology used by the delegate \nresulted in a 99% fail rate; \n\n(e)  the filtering out of the names on a membership list that cannot be matched to the \n\nElectoral Roll (or otherwise excluded) without replacement increases the chance that \na valid list will be rejected; \n\nPage 2 \n\ns 47F (Personal Privacy)s 47F (Personal Privacy\n\n\n--- Page 3 ---\n\n(f)  the delegate’s determination to test only the top 1,650 names on the 13 February \n\n2022 list, rather than selecting names at random from that list, invalidated the testing \nand was unfair;  \n\n(g)  the AEC does not provide information or feedback as to the outcome of membership \ntesting for each individual checked against the Electoral Roll or asked to confirm \nmembership, and this is procedurally unfair; and \n\n(h)  VFUD must be re-registered pending the outcome of review. \n\n submissions \n\n8. \n\nIn summary, in support of his application for review, \n\nsubmitted that:  \n\n(a)  VFUD should have been provided with a list of members who confirmed or denied \n\nmembership in the testing process and details of the timeframe for responses sought \nfrom them; \n\n(b)  the Commission should review the statistical method used in relation to the “top” 1,650 \nnames taken from the 13 February 2022 list for testing, and whether this resulted in \nerror; and \n\n(c)  the Commission should provide the mathematical proof of the sampling method used, \nand review the method and determine the rate at which this method would return a \nfalse negative. \n\nMethodology  \n\n9. \n\nThe Commission noted that the Electoral Act does not provide a method for ascertaining \nwhether a political party satisfies the numerical membership requirements of the Electoral Act. \nThe Commission considered the Methodology (as outlined in the AEC’s Party Registration \nGuide) for determining whether a non-Parliamentary party satisfies these membership \nrequirements. The Commission noted that the Methodology was the same as the sampling \nmethodology recommended by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS). The Commission \nconcluded that the Methodology was appropriate for this purpose. \n\n10. \n\nIn summary, the Methodology requires: \n\n(a)  the provision of a membership list of between 1,500 and 1,650 names for membership \n\ntesting; \n\n(b)  the removal from that list of:  \n\ni.  names that cannot be matched, either via an automated process or manually, \n\nto the Electoral Roll; \n\nii.  names relied on by another party for the purpose of registration or continued \n\nregistration; \n\niii.  duplicate names.   \n\nPage 3 \n\ns 47F (Personal Privacy)s 47F (Personal Privacy)\n\n\n--- Page 4 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 5 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 6 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 7 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 8 ---\n\nThe AEC requires a party to choose a maximum of 1,650 members for the \nmembership list included with their application. The AEC will return a membership list \nin excess of 1,650 members and ask the party to lodge the membership list with \nbetween 1,500 and 1,650 members.  \n\nThe Commission further notes that the delegate did not in fact return the 13 February \n2022 list, which contained the names of 4,680 individuals. Rather, contrary to the \nGuide and the Methodology, the delegate instructed an officer of the Commission to \ntake the top 1,650 names to create another list (the top 1,650 names list) and to test \nthe top 1,650 names list as described above. The Commission accepts that it cannot \ndraw any relevant conclusion from this testing process. The Commission has therefore \nplaced no weight on its results. The Commission accepts the relevant submissions of \n\n and \nsubmissions further.  \n\n in this regard, and it is unnecessary to consider these \n\n22. The Commission rejects the submission that the fact that VFUD provided a list of 4,680 names \n\nto the Commission was sufficient evidence that VFUD has at least 1,500 members. The \nCommission could not be satisfied that VFUD met the numerical membership requirements of \nthe Electoral Act on this basis alone; and the Commission was unable to test this list in \naccordance with the Methodology, which is in all the circumstances a rational, practical and fair \nway of testing the membership requirements of a non-Parliamentary party under the Electoral \nAct. \n\n23. The Commission also notes that the review applicants made criticisms of a more general nature \nregarding various aspects of the Methodology. The Commission’s response to these criticisms \nis set out below. \n\nFiltering  \n\n24. Both \n\n and \n\nobjected to the Commission’s practice of filtering out the names \n\non a membership list that cannot be matched to the Electoral Roll (or are otherwise excluded) \nwithout seeking to replace those names with the names of any additional members that a party \nmay be able to provide on the basis that it increases the error rate. \n\n25. The Commission rejects the submission that the filtering out of these names from a membership \n\nlist containing between 1,500 to 1,650 names increases the error rate (that is, the risk of \nerroneously rejecting a submitted membership list that in fact contains 1,500 party members). \nThe names taken out of such a list at this stage of the process are duplicate names and the \nnames of people who are ineligible to be included in counting the members of a non-\nParliamentary Party (being the deceased, those not enrolled on the Electoral Roll, individuals \nunder 18 years or relied on for registration purposes by another party (see section 123A)). It is \nonly after these names have been taken out of a submitted list that the membership testing \nsample size and maximum number of permitted denials can be properly calculated in \naccordance with the Methodology. The membership testing sample size is calculated relative to \nthe size of the list of names after filtering, not before. For example, one party could submit a list \nof 1650 names, 150 of which need to be filtered out. Another party could submit a list of 1500 \nnames, none of which need to be filtered out. The sample size for both parties, in accordance \nwith ABS advice, would be 18 individuals, with 0 denials permissible to pass testing. The \n\nPage 8 \n\ns 47F (Personal Privacy)s 47F (Personal Privacy)s 47F (Personal Privacys 47F (Personal Privacy\n\n\n--- Page 9 ---\n\nprobably of rejecting a valid list of 1500 members for either hypothetical party will be 0%. \nClearly, the error rate remains the same in both hypothetical cases, and does not increase \nbecause one party has had more names filtered out. \n\n26. Both \n\n and \n\n challenged the fact that the Commission did not as a matter of \npractice provide parties with details of the individuals affirming or denying party membership. \nThe Commission rejects the proposition that this constitutes a denial of procedural fairness. The \nidentity of these individuals is not relevant to the Commission’s inquiry, the purpose of which is \nto establish whether the party meets the numerical membership requirements under and in \naccordance with the Electoral Act by testing a membership list supplied by a party for \n have proposed any other relevant \nregistration purposes. Neither\npurpose. In keeping with the relevant purpose, and in conformity with section 137(2) of the \nElectoral Act and the interests of procedural fairness, the delegate gave VFUD an opportunity to \nprovide a statement setting out why VFUD should not be deregistered under section 137. \n responded by letter dated 13 February 2022, both \nVFUD’s Registered Officer, \nchallenging the Methodology and providing the 13 February 2022 list.  \n\nExcess Capacity argument \n\n27. In his “excess capacity” argument, \n\n contends that the Commission’s membership \n\ntesting process assumes, contrary to fact, that the 1,500 to 1,650 names submitted on a list of \nthe kind sought by the Commission are the only members of the relevant party. \nto demonstrate the weaknesses of this assumption by reference to statistical analyses in \nrelation to a “hypothetical case” consisting of a party with 9,000 members, of whom 4,500 are \nnot “validatable”, 1,800 would deny membership if asked by the AEC and 2,700 would be \n“legitimate”. These analyses proceed on the basis that the “hypothetical party” has provided a \nlist to the Commission comprising 1,650 party members who have been randomly selected from \nits pool of 4,500 “validatable” members. \n\n sought \n\n28. In response to this argument, the Commission notes that the composition of the list provided for \n\nthe purpose of membership testing is for the party to determine. As noted above, the \nCommission expects that a list provided for the express purpose of numerical membership \ntesting will be a high quality one, that is, a list that the party considers accurately records the \nnames of at least 1,500 party members (noting that the party can in fact submit up to 1,650 \nnames). Accordingly, the Commission rejects the hypothetical case and statistical analyses \n because they start from the premise that it is reasonable for a party to \nprovided by \nprovide a list of members who have been randomly selected without regard to whether those \nmembers would likely meet the requirements of the Electoral Act.  \n\nAlternative Methodology \n\n29. While not raised by the review applicants, the Commission notes for completeness the \n\nalternative methodology proposed by \nletter to the delegate. That alternative methodology, as articulated in the response, is as follows: \n\n on behalf of VFUD in his 13 February 2022 \n\nPage 9 \n\ns 47F (Personal Privacy)s 47F (Personal Privacy)s 47F (Personal Privacy)s 47F (Personal Privacy)s 47F (Personal Privacys 47F (Personal Privacys 47F (Personal Privacys 47F (Personal Privacy\n\n\n--- Page 10 ---\n\nBonus: a decisively superior methodology at no additional cost \n\nWe note that the AEC could, at very little cost (time, energy, expense, etc), dramatically increase the \nconfidence of their membership testing by accepting lists of more than 1650 members and following \nthis procedure: \n\n1.  Automatically match all possible members against the electoral roll (as is already done). The \ncost of automatically matching names against the electoral roll is constant regardless of the \ninput size (because it is done by computer). If less than 1650 names are automatically \nmatched, proceed to manual verification (as is done currently) and stop at 1650. Note that this \nwill only ever save the AEC time and money. It is economically rational to do this. \n2.  Where more than 1650 members can be automatically matched, record this number. \n3.  Select 1650 names from that list and conduct 53 trials. use the failure rate to estimate the \n\nprobability of a member being valid. \n\n4.  Use this probability, combined with the length of the list in step (2) to estimate the valid \n\nmembership population of the party being tested. \n\n5.  Calculate error measurements and confidence intervals, etc. (Or evaluate against \n\npredetermined thresholds.) \n\n6.  Determine eligibility. \n\n30. In assessing this argument, it should be borne in mind that, both before the delegate and on \nreview, a party’s task is to show the Commission that it should not be deregistered for the \nreason set out in the notice given under section 137(1) of the Electoral Act. The Commission \nalso observes that registration under the Electoral Act confers on political parties a number of \nbenefits – including the provision of public funds if certain additional criteria are met. It is, \ntherefore, incumbent on VFUD in this case to demonstrate to the Commission that it should not \nbe deregistered for the reason set out in section 137(1)(b) of the Electoral Act, being the reason \nset out in the notice. \n\n31. The Commission does not consider the proposed alternative methodology to be appropriate for \nthe purpose of determining whether a party has 1500 members in accordance with the Electoral \nAct. This is because such proposed alternative methodology requires the Commission to \nassume that the results of testing conducted on a random sample of 1,650 names drawn from a \nbroader list of members may reasonably be relied upon to form a view on the probability that \nthat broader list (which may be many multiples of 1,650) contains 1,500 members who meet the \nrequirements of the Electoral Act. The Commission is not persuaded that such an assumption \nwould be justified.  \n\nStatement of review rights \n\n32.
