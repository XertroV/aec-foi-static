This inquiry was triggered by public complaints and media reports, notably from *The Guardian*, alleging Laming used numerous pages (e.g., \"Redland Bay Bulletin,\" \"Redlands Institute\") disguised as community or news groups to promote political content and attack opponents without mandatory disclosures. The AEC confirmed an active investigation, noting 2018 Electoral Act amendments broadened social media authorisation, and issued formal notices to Laming for detailed information and to third parties (like Facebook) for data, with Facebook confirming its cooperation. Findings revealed some pages were removed or updated with authorisation, while others remained active and unauthorised."

The AEC monitored this sentiment and prepared standard responses.\n*   **Status of Facebook Pages:** AEC analysis found that some of the Facebook pages in question were subsequently removed, while at least one (Redland Bay Bulletin) was later updated by Andrew Laming to include proper authorisation details. Another page (Redlands Institute) remained active and unauthorised.\n*   **Information Gathering:** The AEC issued formal notices under Section 321F of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 to Andrew Laming, requiring him to provide detailed information and documents regarding the administration, content, and authorisation efforts for these Facebook pages. Similar notices were issued to third parties (implied to be Facebook Inc.) seeking relevant data.\n*   **Facebook's Cooperation:** During a Senate committee hearing, a Facebook representative confirmed their cooperation with the AEC's investigation into Laming's activities.\n\nProvide only the markdown formatted summary text. Do not include any conversational filler or preamble."
