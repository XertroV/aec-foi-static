The AEC's reliance on an external body for fundamental methodological guidance on what appears to be an internal administrative function further raises concerns about the electoral body's inherent capabilities or an undue bureaucratization of its oversight. Moreover, the protracted timeline, culminating in policy approval *before* a final external letter, points to a cumbersome, resource-intensive process that likely diverted taxpayer funds to unnecessarily complicate what should have been clear, efficient administrative procedures, rather than demonstrating sound governance."

The mere necessity of an FOI request to uncover these interactions underscores a lack of proactive transparency around internal decision-making processes.\n\nThe AEC's reliance on the ABS for \"detailed methodology\" concerning something as fundamental as party membership testing raises questions about the AEC's internal capabilities and potential mission creep. Why an electoral body requires external statistical expertise for what might be an administrative function suggests either a significant deficit in internal expertise or an undue bureaucratization of regulatory oversight.\n\nThe timeline—featuring multiple correspondences and an internal AEC minute approving policy *before* a final ABS letter—points to a potentially cumbersome and resource-intensive process. Such protracted inter-agency consultations for an internal policy could signal inefficiencies, diverting taxpayer resources and staff time to over-complicate what should be clear administrative procedures. The public is left to surmise whether this extensive back-and-forth reflects sound, efficient governance or an unnecessary expenditure of public funds.\n\nProvide only the markdown formatted summary text. Do not include any conversational filler or preamble."
