            "text": "### Summary of Document Content\n\nThis document is the official response to FOI request LEX7939, which sought statistical data regarding \"designated electors\" from the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC). It addresses the specific data points requested for financial years 2022/23, 2023/24, and 2024/25 (to date).\n\nKey data provided includes:\n\n*   **Total Designated Electors (Item 1):** The document states no direct response was provided for the overall number of designated electors or their breakdown by state/territory/electoral division. Instead, it directs the requester to the AEC website for historical totals per federal electoral event.\n*   **New Declarations (Item 2):**\n    *   FY2022/23: 37\n    *   FY2023/24: 1\n    *   FY2024/25 (to date): 211\n*   **Declaration Authority (Item 2a):** All new declarations reported were made by a delegate of the Electoral Commissioner.\n*   **Internal Review Applications (Item 3):**\n    *   FY2022/23: 4\n    *   FY2023/24: 0\n    *   FY2024/25 (to date): 4\n*   **Internal Review Outcomes (Item 4):**\n    *   FY2022/23: 4 confirmed\n    *   FY2023/24: N/A\n    *   FY2024/25 (to date): 3 confirmed, 1 set aside\n*   **Administrative Review Tribunal (ART) Applications (Item 4):** 0 applications in FY2024/25 to date.\n*   **Declarations Ceasing Effect (s 202AH(3)) (Item 5):** 0 instances recorded for FY2022/23, 2023/24, and 2024/25 to date.\n\n### Relevance to the FOI Request\n\nThe document directly addresses and provides data for most aspects of FOI request LEX7939 as outlined in the overview:\n\n*   It confirms that the **total number of designated electors** (and its breakdown) was not directly supplied but referenced as available on the AEC website, consistent with the FOI overview.\n*   It provides the specific **numbers of new declarations**, showing the notable increase to 211 in FY2024/25 and confirming all were made by a delegate, aligning precisely with the overview.\n*   It details the **number of internal review applications** (4 in FY2022/23 and 4 in FY2024/25) and their **outcomes** (predominantly confirmed, with one set aside in FY2024/25), directly supporting the overview's summary of review processes.\n*   It explicitly states that **no applications for review to the Administrative Review Tribunal** or instances of **declarations ceasing effect under s 202AH(3)** were recorded for the specified periods, confirming these points from the overview.\n\nIn essence, the document serves as the primary source material that corroborates and expands upon the statistical data points summarized in the FOI request overview, demonstrating the AEC's response to the specific queries."

  "prompt": "Considering this document as part of an FOI request, summarize the document and its relevance to the FOI request in markdown format. FYI the overview of the FOI request is: FOI request LEX7939 sought statistical data from the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) on \"designated electors,\" including their overall numbers, new declarations, and associated review processes. While the current total number of designated electors was referenced as available on their website rather than directly provided, the AEC reported 211 new declarations in FY2024/25 to date, a notable increase from previous years, with all declarations made by a delegate of the Electoral Commissioner. The request also revealed a small number of internal review applications (four in FY2022/23 and four in FY2024/25), predominantly resulting in confirmed decisions, though one was set aside in FY2024/25. No applications for review to the Administrative Review Tribunal or instances of declarations ceasing effect under s 202AH(3) were recorded for the specified periods.\n\nDocument Text:\n\nLEX7939  \n\nFOI Request LEX7939 â€“ Designated Electors Data  \n\nI seek access to the following, as at the close of rolls 7 April 2025: \n\n1.
