            "text": "The FOI documents reveal a government electoral body (AEC) exhibiting a profound lack of proactive strategy, astonishing incompetence, and a deeply concerning over-reliance on the self-serving, inadequate measures of foreign tech giants. The most damning implications are as follows:\n\n1.  **Crippling Regulatory Vacuum and Abdication of Duty:**\n    *   The \"Electoral communications escalation scenarios\" document explicitly admits that for many critical issues, including content that misleads voters or brings agencies into disrepute, the government's legal remedies are too slow (\"issue may be to stop the spread of disinformation during an election campaign\").\n    *   Most egregiously, for content that does not breach Commonwealth law but is clearly harmful (e.g., \"false news,\" \"spam,\" or misinformation about informal voting), the AEC openly states it relies entirely on \"Platform policy.\" This is a staggering admission that the Australian government has **outsourced fundamental aspects of electoral integrity to the opaque, self-regulated terms of service of private, profit-driven corporations.** This abdication of responsibility is a catastrophic failure of governance.\n    *   The document also acknowledges that \"Detection and attribution [of foreign interference] can be time and resource intensive, while disinformation strategies are cheap and agile,\" a chilling confession of being outmatched and outmanoeuvred by malicious actors.\n\n2.  **Alarming Lack of Engagement and Preparedness with Major Platforms:**\n    *   The FOI request explicitly asked for correspondence with Meta (Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp) and LinkedIn. The retrieved schedule lists **zero documents** for these dominant platforms, suggesting a critical failure of engagement or, worse, a deliberate blind spot. This indicates the AEC is either utterly disengaged with the most influential online spaces or their FOI response is deliberately incomplete, both being damning.\n    *   For platforms where engagement *is* evidenced (Google, Twitter, TikTok), it is consistently reactive and belated.\n        *   **Google:** AEC is \"chasing\" Google in May 2021 to \"formally begin our collaboration\" for an election due between August 2021 and May 2022. Google's initial outreach in December 2020 consists of providing *their own* global policies and asking the AEC to \"help us prepare for similar scenarios\" by explaining past Australian \"death tax issue\" misinformation. This shows Google dictating the terms of engagement and relying on the AEC to educate *them* on local threats, rather than Google proactively understanding the Australian landscape. The AEC's reliance on Google's generic \"How Google Fights Disinformation\" (dated *February 2019*) as an FOI response document further highlights this passive, uncritical acceptance of tech company narratives. Google's document itself states their algorithms \"do not identify the intent or factual accuracy of any given piece of content\" and \"avoiding judgments on the veracity of statements made about politics or current events\" – a direct admission that their priorities conflict with robust election integrity.\n        *   **Twitter:** As late as June 2020, for the Eden-Monaro by-election, the AEC was still asking Twitter to \"confirm the AEC’s point of contact,\" revealing a shocking lack of established, direct communication channels for urgent issues. Furthermore, attempts to schedule \"initial consultations\" for the 2021/22 Federal Election were met with Twitter contacts being on \"unavoidable leave,\" forcing the AEC to accommodate or reschedule, underscoring a power imbalance and a lack of depth in Twitter's Australian engagement. The AEC then segmented meetings, suggesting fragmented, less impactful discussions.\n        *   **TikTok:** In January 2022, just months before the Federal election, TikTok is proactively suggesting an \"Election Hub\" and offering to use AEC links/logo, essentially taking the lead on civic information dissemination. TikTok itself admitted its platform \"aren't really the platform to go to for politics/news,\" yet the AEC is shown to be relying on it.\n\n3.  **Bureaucratic Inefficiency and Lack of Urgency:**\n    *   The constant back-and-forth emails for scheduling \"initial\" meetings, struggling with \"busy calendars,\" and having \"declined\" meeting invites demonstrate internal bureaucratic lethargy and a failure to prioritize crucial pre-election engagement.\n    *   The existence of multiple, slightly different versions of the \"Electoral communications escalation scenarios\" document (e.g., dated 10 August 2021 and 29 October 2021) suggests internal disorganisation, a reactive approach to policy, or a prolonged, inefficient process to finalise critical protocols.\n\nIn summary, these documents paint a damning picture of a government agency unprepared for the realities of modern digital election interference. The AEC appears to be a minor player, reactive and largely powerless, while powerful tech companies set the terms, offer generic global solutions, and explicitly avoid assessing the truth of political content, leaving Australian electoral integrity dangerously exposed to exploitation."

Whilst we arent \nreally the platform to go to for politics/news we do have young first time voters on TikTok so our view internally is \nthat this Election Hub would be useful for many of our Australian users.  \n\nKind regards  \n\nDISCLAIMER: \n\nIf you have received this transmission in error please notify us immediately by return email and delete all copies.

The AEC is\nwelcome to share these links and information with stakeholders. \n\nElection Advertising: \n\nIf you intend to run election ads on Google platforms read the policy and if you need to register do so\nhere.  Leave at least 5 business days for approval. \nLearn how to use Google Ads via our free Digital Garage training platform. \nIndividuals and organisations can be verified. See the requirements. \nContact us to dispute an ad disapproval.\nEnsure you comply with Google Ads policies including our misrepresentation policy. If you are suspended\nfor a violation, you can appeal here. \nIf you see something amiss you can report an ad. Try to take a screenshot of what you are seeing, and to\nsave the URL so we can follow up as quickly as possible. \nSee the existing transparency reports for countries in which Google’s program is operating. These are\nupdated daily. Australia’s report will launch in 2021.\n\nAction Items\n\nPer the discussion today, following are a couple of places where we state our expectations that all\nadvertisers on our platforms comply with local law. If you have any feedback about the way this is\nexpressed, please let me know and I will pass onto the team for consideration:\n\nOn our Google Ads policy page under political content we state that \"We expect all political ads and\ndestinations to comply with the local campaign and election laws for any area the ads target. This\npolicy includes legally mandated election “silence periods”.\nOn the page titled Verification for election advertising in Australia the current requirement reads\n\"Attestation that the organisation applying for verification has or will satisfy the appropriate\n\n\n--- Page 2 ---\n\ndisclaimer requirements under Australian law.\". \n\nWe'd be happy to organise follow up discussion on misinformation as a shared challenge. It would be very\nuseful to understand the AEC's experience dealing with the death tax issue at the last election and\nperhaps working through any other case studies you are able to share, which could help us prepare for\nsimilar scenarios. Please let me know who I should work with at the AEC to coordinate this meeting. \nIn the meantime, our YouTube misinformation approach is here and more specifically, here is some\ninformation on how YouTube supports elections. You might recognise some of the issues as being more\nrelevant to the US and other countries, but it would be very helpful to understand any specific risks or\nthreats which may be applicable in Australia.\nPlease let me know if there are other ways that Google's public policy team might be able to support the\nAEC as we move closer to the election. Some updates from the last federal election are here, here here,\nand here to give you an idea of our work. \nI hope I've captured everything -- let me know if not! \n\nI look forward to continuing the conversation. \n\nYours sincerely, \n\nGovernment Affairs and Public Policy\n\n\n\n--- Page 1 ---\n\nAnastasia Batten\n\nFrom:\nSent:\nTo:\nCc:\nSubject:\n\nHi \n\n, \n\nEIAT\nWednesday, 9 June 2021 12:07 PM\n\nEIAT\nRE: AEC Engagement for the next Federal Election [SEC=OFFICIAL]\n\nI’m Anna, I work with Julie and she has asked me to come back to you on this one.

The \nAEC is welcome to share these links and information with stakeholders.  \n\nElection Advertising:  \n\n2\n\n\n--- Page 3 ---\n\n•€€€€€€€€ If you intend to run election ads on Google platforms read the policy and if you need to \nregister do so here.  Leave at least 5 business days for approval.  \n\n•€€€€€€€€ Learn how to use Google Ads via our free Digital Garage training platform.  \n\n•€€€€€€€€ Individuals and organisations can be verified. See the requirements.  \n\n•€€€€€€€€ Contact us to dispute an ad disapproval. \n\n•€€€€€€€€ Ensure you comply with Google Ads policies including our misrepresentation policy. If you \nare suspended for a violation, you can appeal here.  \n\n•€€€€€€€€ If you see something amiss you can report an ad. Try to take a screenshot of what you are \nseeing, and to save the URL so we can follow up as quickly as possible.  \n\n•€€€€€€€€ See the existing transparency reports for countries in which Google’s program is \noperating. These are updated daily. Australia’s report will launch in 2021. \n\nAction Items \n\n•  Per the discussion today, following are a couple of places where we state our expectations that all \nadvertisers on our platforms comply with local law. If you have any feedback about the way this is \nexpressed, please let me know and I will pass onto the team for consideration:  \n\no  On our Google Ads policy page under political content we state that \"We expect all political \nads and destinations to comply with the local campaign and election laws for any area the \nads target. This policy includes legally mandated election “silence periods”. \n\no  On the page titled Verification for election advertising in Australia the current requirement \nreads \"Attestation that the organisation applying for verification has or will satisfy the \nappropriate disclaimer requirements under Australian law.\".  \n\n•  We'd be happy to organise follow up discussion on misinformation as a shared challenge. It would \nbe very useful to understand the AEC's experience dealing with the death tax issue at the last \nelection and perhaps working through any other case studies you are able to share, which could \nhelp us prepare for similar scenarios. Please let me know who I should work with at the AEC to \ncoordinate this meeting.  \n\n•  In the meantime, our YouTube misinformation approach is here and more specifically, here is some \ninformation on how YouTube supports elections. You might recognise some of the issues as being \nmore relevant to the US and other countries, but it would be very helpful to understand any specific \nrisks or threats which may be applicable in Australia. \n\n•  Please let me know if there are other ways that Google's public policy team might be able to \n\nsupport the AEC as we move closer to the election. Some updates from the last federal election \nare here, here here, and here to give you an idea of our work.  \n\nI hope I've captured everything -- let me know if not!  \n\nI look forward to continuing the conversation.  \n\nYours sincerely,  \n\n3\n\n\n--- Page 4 ---\n\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 1 ---\n\nHow Google Fights \nDisinformation\n\n\n--- Page 2 ---\n\nOur work to tackle the intentional \nspread of misinformation across \nGoogle Search, Google News,  \nYouTube, and our advertising platforms. \n\nIntroduction .....................................................................................................................2\n\n       What is disinformation? ...........................................................................................2\n\n       Tackling disinformation across Google ..................................................................3\n\n       Teaming up with newsrooms and outside experts ................................................5\n\n       Getting ahead of future risks ...................................................................................7\n\nGoogle Search, Google News & Disinformation ..........................................................9\n\n       Background ...............................................................................................................9\n\n       Tackling disinformation on Google Search & Google News ................................10\n\nYouTube & Disinformation ...........................................................................................17\n\n       Background .............................................................................................................17\n\n       Tackling disinformation on YouTube ....................................................................18\n\nGoogle Advertising Products & Disinformation .........................................................25\n\n       Background .............................................................................................................25\n\n       Tackling disinformation on Google’s advertising platforms ................................26\n\nConclusion ....................................................................................................................29\n\n1\n\nFebruary 2019\n\n\n--- Page 3 ---\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe  open  Internet  has  enabled  people  to  create,  connect,  and  distribute  information  like  never  before.  It  has \nexposed us to perspectives and experiences that were previously out-of-reach. It has enabled increased access \nto knowledge for everyone.\n\nGoogle continues to believe that the Internet is a boon to society – contributing to global education, healthcare, \nresearch, and economic development by enabling citizens to become more knowledgeable and involved through \naccess to information at an unprecedented scale. \n\nHowever, like other communication channels, the open Internet is vulnerable to the organized propagation of false \nor misleading information. Over the past several years, concerns that we have entered a “post-truth” era have \nbecome a controversial subject of political and academic debate.\n\nThese  concerns  directly  affect  Google  and  our  mission  –  to  organize  the  world’s  information  and  make  it \nuniversally accessible and useful. When our services are used to propagate deceptive or misleading information, \nour mission is undermined. \n\nHow companies like Google address these concerns has an impact on society and on the trust users place in \nour  services.  We  take  this  responsibility  very  seriously  and  believe  it  begins  with  providing  transparency  into  \nour policies, inviting feedback, enabling users, and collaborating with policymakers, civil society, and academics \naround the world.\n\nThis document outlines our perspective on disinformation and misinformation and how we address it throughout \nGoogle. It begins with the three strategies that comprise our response across products, and an overview of our \nefforts beyond the scope of our products. It continues with an in-depth look at how these strategies are applied, \nand expanded, to Google Search, Google News, YouTube, and our advertising products. \n\nWe welcome a dialogue about what works well, what does not, and how we can work with others in academia, \ncivil society, newsrooms, and governments to meet the ever-evolving challenges of disinformation.\n\nWhat is disinformation?\n\nAs we’ve all experienced over the past few years, the words “misinformation”, “disinformation”, and “fake news” \nmean different things to different people and can become politically charged when they are used to characterize \nthe propagators of a specific ideology or to undermine political adversaries. \n\nHowever, there is something objectively problematic and harmful to our users when malicious actors attempt to \ndeceive them. It is one thing to be wrong about an issue. It is another to purposefully disseminate information one \nknows to be inaccurate with the hope that others believe it is true or to create discord in society. \n\nWe refer to these deliberate efforts to deceive and mislead using the speed, scale, and technologies of the open \nweb as “disinformation”.\n\nThe entities that engage in disinformation have a diverse set of goals. Some are financially motivated, engaging \nin  disinformation  activities  for  the  purpose  of  turning  a  profit.  Others  are  politically  motivated,  engaging  in \ndisinformation  to  foster  specific  viewpoints  among  a  population,  to  exert  influence  over  political  processes, \nor  for  the  sole  purpose  of  polarizing  and  fracturing  societies.  Others  engage  in  disinformation  for  their  own \nentertainment, which often involves bullying, and they are commonly referred to as “trolls”.\n\n2\n\nHow Google Fights Disinformation\n\n\n--- Page 4 ---\n\nLevels of funding and sophistication vary across those entities, ranging from local mom-and-pop operations to \nwell-funded and state-backed campaigns. In addition, propagators of disinformation sometimes end up working \ntogether, even unwittingly. For instance, politically motivated actors might emphasize a piece of disinformation \nthat financially motivated groups might latch onto because it is getting enough attention to be a potential revenue \nsource. Sometimes, a successful disinformation narrative is propagated by content creators who are acting in \ngood faith and are unaware of the goals of its originators. \n\nThis  complexity  makes  it  difficult  to  gain  a  full  picture  of  the  efforts  of  actors  who  engage  in  disinformation \nor  gauge  how  effective  their  efforts  may  be.  Furthermore,  because  it  can  be  difficult  to  determine  whether  a \npropagator of falsehoods online is acting in good faith, responses to disinformation run the risk of inadvertently \nharming legitimate expression.\n\nTackling disinformation in our products  \nand services\n\nWe have an important responsibility to our users and to the societies in which we operate to curb the efforts \nof  those  who  aim  to  propagate  false  information  on  our  platforms.  At  the  same  time,  we  respect  our  users’ \nfundamental human rights (such as free expression) and we try to be clear and predictable in our efforts, letting \nusers and content creators decide for themselves whether we are operating fairly. Of course, this is a delicate \nbalance, as sharing too much of the granular details of how our algorithms and processes work would make it \neasier for bad actors to exploit them.\n\nWe face complex trade-offs and there is no ‘silver bullet’ that will resolve the issue of disinformation, because:\n\n•  It can be extremely difficult (or even impossible) for humans or technology to determine the veracity of, or \n\nintent behind, a given piece of content, especially when it relates to current events. \n\n•  Reasonable  people  can  have  different  perspectives  on  the  right  balance  between  risks  of  harm  to  good \n\nfaith, free expression, and the imperative to tackle disinformation. \n\n•  The solutions we build have to apply in ways that are understandable and predictable for users and content \ncreators, and compatible with the kind of automation that is required when operating services on the scale \nof the web. We cannot create standards that require deep deliberation for every individual decision.\n\n•  Disinformation manifests differently on different products and surfaces. Solutions that might be relevant in \none context might be irrelevant or counter-productive in others. Our products cannot operate in the exact \nsame way in that regard, and this is why they approach disinformation in their own specific ways.\n\nOur  approach  to  tackling  disinformation  in  our  products  and  services  is  based  around  a  framework  of  three \nstrategies: make quality count in our ranking systems, counteract malicious actors, and give users more context. \nWe will outline them in this section, as well as the efforts we undertake beyond the scope of our products and \nservices  to  team  up  with newsrooms  and  outside experts, and  to  get ahead of  future  risks. It  is worth noting \nthat  these  strategies  are  also  used  to  address  misinformation  more  broadly,  which  pertains  to  the  overall \ntrustworthiness of the information we provide users in our products.\n\nIn  later  sections  of  this  paper,  we  will  detail  how  these  strategies  are  implemented  and  expanded  for  Google \nSearch, Google News, YouTube, and our advertising platforms. We adopt slightly different approaches in how we \napply these principles to different products given how each service presents its own unique challenges.\n\n3\n\n\n--- Page 5 ---\n\n1.  Make Quality Count\n\nOur products are designed to sort through immense amounts of material and deliver content that best meets \nour users’ needs. This means delivering quality information and trustworthy commercial messages, especially \nin contexts that are prone to rumors and the propagation of false information (such as breaking news events).\n\nWhile each product and service implements this differently, they share important principles that ensure our \nalgorithms treat websites and content creators fairly and evenly: \n\n•  Information is organized by “ranking algorithms”. \n\n•  These  algorithms  are  geared  toward  ensuring  the  usefulness  of  our  services,  as  measured  by  user \ntesting,  not  fostering  the  ideological  viewpoints  of  the  individuals  that  build  or  audit  them.  When  it \ncomes  to  Google  Search,  you  can  find  a  detailed  explanation  of  how  those  algorithms  operate  at  \ngoogle.com/search/howsearchworks.\n\n2.  Counteract Malicious Actors\n\nAlgorithms  cannot  determine  whether  a  piece  of  content  on  current  events  is  true  or  false,  nor  can  they \nassess the intent of its creator just by reading what’s on a page. However, there are clear cases of intent to \nmanipulate or deceive users. For instance, a news website that alleges it contains “Reporting from Bordeaux, \nFrance” but whose account activity indicates that it is operated out of New Jersey in the U.S. is likely not being \ntransparent with users about its operations or what they can trust it to know firsthand.\n\nThat’s why our policies across Google Search, Google News, YouTube, and our advertising products clearly \noutline behaviors that are prohibited – such as misrepresentation of one’s ownership or primary purpose on \nGoogle News and our advertising products, or impersonation of other channels or individuals on YouTube. \n\nFurthermore, since the early days of Google and YouTube, many content creators have tried to deceive our \nranking systems to get more visibility – a set of practices we view as a form of ‘spam’ and that we’ve invested \nsignificant resources to address. \n\nThis is relevant to tackling disinformation since many of those who engage in the creation or propagation of \ncontent for the purpose to deceive often deploy similar tactics in an effort to achieve more visibility. Over the \ncourse of the past two decades, we have invested in systems that can reduce ‘spammy’ behaviors at scale, \nand we complement those with human reviews. \n\n4\n\nHow Google Fights Disinformation\n\n\n--- Page 6 ---\n\n3.  Give Users More Context\n\nEasy  access  to  context  and  a  diverse  set  of  perspectives  are  key  to  providing  users  with  the  information \nthey need to form their own views. Our products and services expose users to numerous links or videos in \nresponse to their searches, which maximizes the chances that users are exposed to diverse perspectives or \nviewpoints before deciding what to explore in depth.\n\nGoogle  Search,  Google  News,  YouTube,  and  our  advertising  products  have  all  developed  additional \nmechanisms to provide more context and agency to users. Those include:\n\n•  “Knowledge”  or  “Information”  Panels  in  Google  Search  and  YouTube,  providing  high-level  facts  about  a \n\nperson or issue. \n\n•  Making it easier to discover the work of fact-checkers on Google Search or Google News, by using labels or \n\nsnippets making it clear to users that a specific piece of content is a fact-checking article.\n\n•  A “Full Coverage” function in Google News enabling users to access a non-personalized, in-depth view of a \n\nnews cycle at the tap of a finger. \n\n•  “Breaking News” and “Top News” shelves, and “Developing News” information panels on YouTube, making \nsure that users are exposed to news content from authoritative sources when looking for information about \nongoing news events. \n\n•  Information panels providing “Topical Context” and “Publisher Context” on YouTube, providing users with \ncontextual information from trusted sources to help them be more informed consumers of content on the \nplatform. These panels provide authoritative information on well-established historical and scientific topics \nthat have often been subject to misinformation online and on the sources of news content, respectively. \n\n•  “Why  this  ad”  labels  enabling  users  to  understand  why  they’re  presented  with  a  specific  ad  and  how  to \nchange  their  preferences  so  as  to  alter  the  personalization  of  the  ads  they  are  shown,  or  to  opt  out  of \npersonalized ads altogether.\n\n•  In-ad disclosures and transparency reports on election advertising, which are rolling out during elections \n\nin the US, Europe, and India as a starting point.\n\nWe also empower users to let us know when we’re getting it wrong by using feedback buttons across Search, \nYouTube, and our advertising products to flag content that might be violating our policies.\n\nTeaming up with newsrooms and outside experts\n\nOur  work  to  address  disinformation  is  not  limited  to  the  scope  of  our  products  and  services.  Indeed, \nother  organizations  play  a  fundamental  role  in  addressing  this  societal  challenge,  such  as  newsrooms,  \nfact-checkers,  civil  society  organizations,  or  researchers.  While  we  all  address  different  aspects  of  this  issue, \nit is only by coming together that we can succeed. That is why we dedicate significant resources to supporting \nquality  journalism,  and  to  weaving  together  partnerships  with  many  other  organizations  in  this  space. \n\n5\n\n\n--- Page 7 ---\n\nSupporting quality journalism\n\nPeople come to Google looking for information they can trust and that information often comes from the reporting \nof journalists and news organizations around the world.\n\nA thriving news ecosystem matters deeply to Google and directly impacts our efforts to combat disinformation. \nWhen quality journalism struggles to reach wide audiences, malicious actors have more room to propagate false \ninformation. \n\nOver the years, we’ve worked closely with the news industry to address these challenges and launched products \nand programs to help improve the business model of online journalism. These include the Accelerated Mobile \nPages  Project1  to  improve  the  mobile  web,  YouTube  Player  for  Publishers2  to  simplify  video  distribution  and \nreduce costs, and many more.\n\nIn  March  2018,  we  launched  the  Google  News  Initiative  (GNI)3  to  help  journalism  thrive  in  the  digital  age.  \nWith a $300 million commitment over 3 years, the initiative aims to elevate and strengthen quality journalism, \nevolve  business  models  to  drive  sustainable  growth,  and  empower  news  organizations  through  technological \ninnovation. $25M of this broader investment was earmarked as innovation grants for YouTube to support news \norganizations in building sustainable video operations.\n\nOne  of  the  programs  supported  by  the  Google  News  Initiative  is  Subscribe  with  Google4,  a  way  for  people  to \neasily  subscribe  to  various  news  outlets,  helping  publishers  engage  readers  across  Google  and  the  web. \nAnother  is  News  Consumer  Insights,  a  new  dashboard  built  on  top  of  Google  Analytics,  which  will  help  news \norganizations  of  all  sizes  understand  and  segment  their  audiences  with  a  subscriptions  strategy  in  mind.  \nMore details on these projects and others can be found at g.co/newsinitiative.\n\nPartnering with outside experts\n\nAddressing disinformation is not something we can do on our own. The Google News Initiative also houses our \nproducts, partnerships, and programs dedicated to supporting news organizations in their efforts create quality \nreporting that displaces disinformation. This includes:\n\n•  Helping  to  launch  the  First  Draft  Coalition  (https://firstdraftnews.org/),  a  nonprofit  that  convenes  news \norganizations and technology companies to tackle the challenges around combating disinformation online \n– especially in the run-up to elections. \n\n•  Participating in and providing financial support to the Trust Project (http://thetrustproject.org/), of which \nGoogle  is  a  founding  member  and  which  explores  how  journalism  can  signal  its  trustworthiness  online. \nThe Trust Project has developed eight indicators of trust that publishers can use to better convey why their \ncontent should be seen as credible, with promising results for the publishers who have trialed them.\n\n•  Partnering  with  Poynter’s  International  Fact-Checking  Network  (IFCN)5,  a  nonpartisan  organization \ngathering  fact-checking  organizations  from  the  United  States,  Germany,  Brazil,  Argentina,  South  Africa, \nIndia, and more. \n\nIn  addition,  we  support  the  work  of  researchers  who  explore  the  issues  of  disinformation  and  trust  in  \njournalism by funding research at organizations like First Draft, the Oxford University’s Reuters News Institute,  \nMichigan University’s Quello Center for Telecommunication Management law, and more. \n\n6\n\nHow Google Fights Disinformation\n\n\n--- Page 8 ---\n\nFinally, in March 2018, Google.org (Google’s philanthropic arm) launched a $10 million global initiative to support \nmedia literacy around the world in the footsteps of programs we have already supported in the UK, Brazil, Canada, \nIndonesia, and more. \n\nWe will continue to explore more ways to partner with others on these issues, whether by building new products \nthat might benefit the work of journalists and fact-checkers, supporting more independent initiatives that help \ncurb disinformation, or developing self-regulatory practices to demonstrate our responsibility.\n\nGetting ahead of future risks\n\nCreators of disinformation will never stop trying to find new ways to deceive users. It is our responsibility to make \nsure we stay ahead of the game. Many of the product strategies and external partnerships mentioned earlier help \nus reach that goal. In addition, we dedicate specific focus to bolstering our defenses in the run-up to elections \nand invest in research and development efforts to stay ahead of new technologies or tactics that could be used \nby malicious actors, such as synthetic media (also known as ‘deep fakes’).\n\nProtecting elections\n\nFair elections are critical to the health of democracy and we take our work to protect elections very seriously. Our \nproducts can help make sure users have access to accurate information about elections. For example, we often \npartner with election commissions, or other official sources, to make sure key information like the location of \npolling booths or the dates of the votes are easily available to users. \n\nWe  also  work  to  protect  elections  from  attacks  and  interference,  including  focusing  on  combating  political \ninfluence operations, improving account and website security, and increasing transparency.\n\nTo prevent political influence operations, working with our partners at Jigsaw, we have multiple internal teams \nthat identify malicious actors wherever they originate, disables their accounts, and shares threat information with \nother companies and law enforcement officials. We routinely provide public updates about these operations.7\n\nThere  is  more  we  can  do  beyond  protecting  our  own  platforms.  Over  the  past  several  years,  we  have  taken \nsteps  to  help  protect  accounts,  campaigns,  candidates,  and  officials  against  digital  attacks.  Our  Protect  Your \nElection project8 offers a suite of extra security to protect against malicious or insecure apps and guards against \nphishing. To protect election and campaign websites, we also offer Project Shield9, which can mitigate the risk of \nDistributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. \n\nIn the run-up to elections, we provide free training to ensure that campaign professionals and political parties are \nup-to-speed on the means to protect themselves from attack. For instance, in 2018, we trained more than 1,000 \ncampaign professionals and the eight major U.S. Republican and Democratic committees on email and campaign \nwebsite security. \n\nFurthermore,  as  a  part  of  our  security  efforts,  for  the  past  eight  years,  we  have  displayed  warnings  to  Gmail \nusers who are at risk of phishing by potentially state-sponsored actors (even though, in most cases, the specific \nphishing attempt never reaches the user’s inbox). \n\n7\n\n\n--- Page 9 ---\n\nFinally, in order to help understand the context for the election-related ads they see online, we require additional \nverification for advertisers who wish to purchase political ads in the United States, provide transparency about the \nadvertiser to the user, and have established an online transparency report and creative repository on US federal \nelections.10\n\nWe look forward to expanding these tools, trainings, and strategies to more elections in 2019, starting with efforts \nfocused on two of the world’s largest upcoming elections, which are in Europe11 and in India.12\n\nExpecting the unexpected \n\nCreators of disinformation are constantly exploring new ways to bypass the defenses set by online services in an \neffort to spread their messages to a wider audience.\n\nTo  stay  ahead  of  the  curve,  we  continuously  invest  resources  to  stay  abreast  of  the  next  tools,  tactics,  or \ntechnologies that creators of disinformation may attempt to use. We convene with experts all around the world \nto understand what concerns them. We also invest in research, product, and policy developments to anticipate \nthreat vectors that we might not be equipped to tackle at this point. \n\nOne example is the rise of new forms of AI-generated, photo-realistic, synthetic audio or video content known as \n“synthetic media” (often referred to as “deep fakes”). While this technology has useful applications (for instance, \nby opening new possibilities to those affected by speech or reading impairments, or new creative grounds for \nartists and movie studios around the world), it raises concerns when used in disinformation campaigns and for \nother malicious purposes.\n\nThe field of synthetic media is fast-moving and it is hard to predict what might happen in the near future. To help \nprepare for this issue, Google and YouTube are investing in research to understand how AI might help detect such \nsynthetic content as it emerges, working with leading experts in this field from around the world.\n\nFinally,  because  no  detector  can  be  perfect,  we  are  engaging  with  civil  society,  academia,  newsrooms,  and \ngovernments to share our best understanding of this challenge and work together on what other steps societies \ncan  take  to  improve  their  preparedness.  This  includes  exploring  ways  to  help  others  come  up  with  their  own \ndetection tools. One example may involve releasing datasets of synthesized content that others can use to train \nAI-based detectors.13\n\n8\n\nHow Google Fights Disinformation\n\n\n--- Page 10 ---\n\nGoogle Search,  \nGoogle News & Disinformation \nBackground\n\nGoogle  created  its  search  engine  in  1998,  with  a  mission  to  organize  the  world’s  information  and  make  it \nuniversally accessible and useful. At the time, the web consisted of just 25 million pages. \n\nToday, we index hundreds of billions of pages – more information than all the libraries in the world could hold and \nserve people all over the world. Search is offered in more than 150 languages and over 190 countries. \n\nWe continue to improve on Search every day. In 2017 alone, Google conducted more than 200,000 experiments \nthat resulted in about 2,400 changes to Search. Each of those changes is tested to make sure it aligns with our \npublicly available Search Quality Rater Guidelines,14 which define the goals of our ranking systems and guide the \nexternal evaluators who provide ongoing assessments of our algorithms.\n\nOver the past 20 years, we have grappled with the tension between the open access to information and expression \nthat  the  web  enables  and  the  need  to  ensure  trust  in  authoritative  information.  Our  work  on  disinformation \ncontinues to be informed by these dual goals, as we attempt to strike the right balance in tackling this challenge. \n\nDifferent  types  of  content  may  require  different  approaches  to  ranking  and  presentation  in  order  to  meet  our \nusers’  needs.  Google  News  arose  from  such  a  realization  and  was  one  of  the  first  products  Google  launched \nbeyond Search. Former Googler Krishna Bharat observed that when people searched for news after the tragic \n9/11 attacks in New York, Google responded with old news stories about New York rather than the latest events. \nHe set about to fix that, and on September 22, 2002, Google News was born.\n\nOver  time,  Google  News  has  improved,  including  how  we  present  content  related  to  current  events  in  Google \nSearch. In 2018, we launched a reimagined Google News that uses a new set of AI techniques to take a constant \nflow of information as it hits the web, analyze it in real-time, and organize it around breaking news events.15\n\nin  our  mission  and \n\nThrough  all  of  this,  we’ve  remained \ngrounded \nthe \nimportance  of  providing  greater  access \nto  information,  helping  users  navigate \nthe  open  web.  We  continue  to  believe \nthat  this  access \nis  fundamental  to \nhelping people make sense of the world \naround  them,  exercise  their  own  critical \nthinking,  and  make  informed  decisions \nas citizens.\n\nGoogle News App\n\n9\n\n\n--- Page 11 ---\n\nTackling disinformation on Google Search  \n& Google News\n\nSince  Google’s  early  days,  malicious  actors  have  attempted  to  harm  or  deceive  Search  users  through  a  wide \nrange  of  actions,  including  tricking  our  systems  in  order  to  promote  their  own  content  (via  a  set  of  practices \nwe refer to as “spam”), propagating malware, and engaging in illegal acts online. The creators and purveyors of \ndisinformation employ many of the same tactics.\n\nDisinformation  poses  a  unique  challenge.  Google  is  not  in  a  situation  to  assess  objectively,  and  at  scale,  the \nveracity of a piece of content or the intent of its creators. Further, a considerable percentage of content contains \ninformation that cannot be objectively verified as fact. This is because it either lacks necessary context, because \nit is delivered through an ideological lens others may disagree with, or because it is constructed from contested \ndatapoints. \n\nDisinformation  also  raises  broader  concerns  of  harm.  In  the  worst  cases,  the  impacts  of  disinformation \ncampaigns can affect an entire society. The stakes of accurately identifying disinformation are higher because \ndisinformation often concerns issues at the core of political society for which the free exchange of ideas and \ninformation among genuine voices is of the greatest importance.\n\nTo deal with this issue, Google Search and Google News take a pragmatic approach that reinforces the product \nstrategies we have highlighted in the opening section of this paper:\n\n•  Make Quality Count\n\n•  We use ranking algorithms to elevate authoritative, high-quality information in our products.\n\n•  We  take  additional  steps  to  improve  the  quality  of  our  results  for  contexts  and  topics  that  our  users \n\nexpect us to handle with particular care.\n\n•  Counteract Malicious Actors\n\n•  We  look  for  and  take  action  against  attempts  to  deceive  our  ranking  systems  or  circumvent  \n\nour policies.\n\n•  Give Users More Context\n\n•  We provide users with tools to access the context and diversity of perspectives they need to form their \n\nown views.\n\n10\n\nHow Google Fights Disinformation\n\n\n--- Page 12 ---\n\nDo Google News and Google Search combat disinformation  \nin the same ways? \n\nGoogle News’ focus – coverage of current events – is narrower than that of Google Search. However, their \ngoals are closely related. Both products present users with trustworthy results that meet their information \nneeds about the issues they care about. \n\nFor that reason, both products have a lot in common when it comes to the way they operate For instance, \nranking in Google News is built on the basis of Google Search ranking and they share the same defenses \nagainst “spam” (attempts at gaming our ranking systems).\n\nIn addition, both products share some fundamental principles: \n\n•  They use algorithms, not humans, to determine the ranking of the content they show to users No individual \nat Google ever makes determinations about the position of an individual webpage link on a Google Search \nor Google News results page. \n\n•  Our algorithms are geared toward ensuring the usefulness of our services, as measured by user testing, \n\nnot fostering the ideological viewpoints of the individuals who build or audit them. \n\n•  The  systems  do  not  make  subjective  determinations  about  the  truthfulness  of  webpages,  but  rather \nfocus  on  measurable  signals  that  correlate  with  how  users  and  other  websites  value  the  expertise, \ntrustworthiness, or authoritativeness of a webpage on the topics it covers. \n\nThat said, because Google News’ purposes are explicitly narrower than those of Google Search and solely \nfocused on coverage of current events, it builds its own ranking systems and content policies on top of \nthose of Google Search.\n\nWhen it comes to ranking, this means that the systems we use in Google News and in places that are \nfocused  on  News  in  Google  Search  (e.g.  our  “Top  Stories”  Carousel  or  our  “News” Tab)  make  special \nefforts  to  understand  things  like  the  prominence  of  a  news  story  in  the  media  landscape  of  the  day, \nwhich articles most relate to that story, or which sources are most trusted for specific news topics. It \nalso means that Google News might give additional importance toward factors that indicate a webpage’s \nnewsworthiness  or  journalistic  value  for  users,  such  as  its  freshness  or  (for  specific  tabs  within   \nGoogle News).\n\nWhen it comes to content policies: \n\n•  Google Search aims to make information from the web available to all our users. That’s why we do not \nremove  content  from  results  in  Google  Search,  except  in  very  limited  circumstances.  These  include \nlegal  removals,  violations  of  our  webmaster  guidelines,  or  a  request  from  the  webmaster  responsible  \nfor the page. \n\n•  Google Search contains some features that are distinct from its general results, such as Autocomplete. \nFor  features  where  Google  specifically  promotes  or  highlights  content,  we  may  remove  content  that \nviolates their specific policies.16\n\n•  Because  Google  News  does  not  attempt  to  be  a  comprehensive  reflection  of  the  web,  but  instead  to \nfocus  on  journalistic  accounts  of  current  events,  it  has  more  restrictive  content  policies  than  Google \nSearch. Google News explicitly prohibits content that incites, promotes, or glorifies violence, harassment, \nor dangerous activities. Similarly, Google News does not allow sites or accounts that impersonate any \nperson or organization, that misrepresent or conceal their ownership or primary purpose, or that engage \nin coordinated activity to mislead users.17\n\n11\n\n\n--- Page 13 ---\n\nWith those nuances in mind, it is still safe to think of Google News and Google Search’s approaches to \ndisinformation  and  misinformation  are  mostly  similar,  and  the  content  of  the  following  sections  apply \nto both products. Where there is a difference, it will be outlined explicitly in the body of the text or in a \ndedicated callout box.\n\nWe use ranking algorithms to elevate high-quality  \ninformation in our products\n\nRanking  algorithms  are  an  important  tool  in  our  fight  against  disinformation.  Ranking  elevates  the  relevant \ninformation that our algorithms determine is the most authoritative and trustworthy above information that may \nbe less reliable. These assessments may vary for each webpage on a website and are directly related to our users’ \nsearches. For instance, a national news outlet’s articles might be deemed authoritative in response to searches \nrelating to current events, but less reliable for searches related to gardening.\n\nFor most searches that could potentially surface misleading information, there is high-quality information that \nour ranking algorithms can detect and elevate. When we succeed in surfacing high-quality results, lower quality \nor outright malicious results (such as disinformation or otherwise deceptive pages) are relegated to less visible \npositions in Search or News, letting users begin their journey by browsing more reliable sources.\n\nOur ranking system does not identify the intent or factual accuracy of any given piece of content. However, it is \nspecifically designed to identify sites with high indicia of expertise, authority, and trustworthiness.\n\nHow do Google’s algorithms assess expertise, authority,  \nand trustworthiness?\n\n•  Google’s algorithms identify signals about pages that correlate with trustworthiness and authoritativeness. \nThe  best  known  of  these  signals  is  PageRank,  which  uses  links  on  the  web  to  understand \nauthoritativeness.\n\n•  We are constantly evolving these algorithms to improve results – not least because the web itself keeps \nchanging.  For  instance,  in  2017  alone,  we  ran  over  200,000  experiments  with  trained  external  Search \nEvaluators and live user tests, resulting in more than 2,400 updates to Google Search algorithms.\n\n•  To perform these evaluations, we work with Search Quality Evaluators who help us measure the quality \nof Search results on an ongoing basis. Evaluators assess whether a website provides users who click on \nit with the content they were looking for, and they evaluate the quality of results based on the expertise, \nauthoritativeness, and trustworthiness of the content.\n\n•  The resulting ratings do not affect the ranking of any individual website, but they do help us benchmark \nthe quality of our results, which in turn allows us to build algorithms that globally recognize results that \nmeet high-quality criteria. To ensure a consistent approach, our evaluators use the Search Quality Rater \nGuidelines (publicly available online)18 which provide guidance and examples for appropriate ratings. To \nensure  the  consistency  of  the  rating  program,  Search  Quality  evaluators  must  pass  a  comprehensive \nexam and are audited on a regular basis.\n\n•  These  evaluators  also  perform  evaluations  of  each  improvement  to  Search  we  roll  out:  in  side-by-side \nexperiments,  we  show  evaluators  two  different  sets  of  Search  results,  one  with  the  proposed  change \nalready implemented and one without. We ask them which results they prefer and why. This feedback is \ncentral to our launch decisions.\n\nFor more information about how our ranking work, please visit:  \nwww.google.com/search/howsearchworks \n\n12\n\nHow Google Fights Disinformation\n\n\n--- Page 14 ---\n\nWe take additional steps to improve the trustworthiness of our results for \ncontexts and topics that our users expect us to handle with particular care. \n\nOur  Search  Quality  Raters  Guidelines  acknowledge  that  some  types  of  pages  could  potentially  impact  the \nfuture  happiness,  health,  financial  stability,  or  safety  of  users.  We  call  those  “Your  Money  or  Your  Life”  pages \nor  YMYL.  We  introduced  the  YMYL  category  in  2014. They  include  financial  transaction  or  information  pages, \nmedical  and  legal  information  pages,  as  well  as  news  articles,  and  public  and/or  official  information  pages \nthat are important for having an informed citizenry. This last category can comprise anything from information \nabout local, state, or national government processes or policies, news about important topics in a given country,  \nor disaster response services. \n\nFor  these  “YMYL”  pages,  we  assume  that \nusers  expect  us  to  operate  with  our  strictest \nstandards  of \ntrustworthiness  and  safety.  \nAs  such,  where  our  algorithms  detect  that \na  user’s  query  relates  to  a  “YMYL”  topic,  we \nwill  give  more  weight  in  our  ranking  systems \nlike  our  understanding  of  the \nto  factors \nauthoritativeness, expertise, or trustworthiness \nof the pages we present in response.\n\nOur Search Quality Raters Guidelines\n\nSimilarly,  we  direct  our  Google  Search \nevaluators  to  be  more  demanding  in  their \nassessment of the quality and trustworthiness \nof  these  page  than  they  would  otherwise. \nin  2016,  we  added  additional \nSpecifically, \nguidance to our Search Quality Rater Guidelines advising evaluators to give lower quality ratings to informational \npages that contain demonstrably inaccurate content or debunked conspiracy theories. While their ratings don’t \ndetermine individual page rankings, they are used to help us gather data on the quality of our results and identify \nareas where we need to improve. This data from Search Evaluators also plays a significant role in determining \nwhich changes we roll out to our ranking systems. \n\nBeyond specific types of content that are more sensitive to users, we realize that some contexts are more prone \nto the propagation of disinformation than others. For instance, breaking news events, and the heightened level \nof interest that they elicit, are magnets for bad behavior by malicious players. Speculation can outrun facts as \nlegitimate news outlets on the ground are still investigating. At the same time, malicious actors are publishing \ncontent on forums and social media with the intent to mislead and capture people’s attention as they rush to \nfind trusted information. To reduce the visibility of this type of content, we have designed our systems to prefer \nauthority over factors like recency or exact word matches while a crisis is developing.\n\nIn  addition,  we  are  particularly  attentive  to  the  integrity  of  our  systems  in  the  run-up  to  significant  societal \nmoments in the countries where we operate, such as elections.19\n\nWe actively look for and take action against attempts to deceive  \nour ranking systems or circumvent our policies.\n\nGoogle  is  designed  to  help  users  easily  discover  and  access  the  webpages  that  contain  the  information  they \nare looking for. Our goals are aligned with those of site owners who publish high-quality content online because \nthey want it to be discovered by users who might be interested. That’s why we provide extensive tools and tips \n\n13\n\n\n--- Page 15 ---\n\nto  help  webmasters  and  developers \nmanage \ntheir  Search  presence  and \nsucceed  in  having  their  content,  sites, \nand  apps  found.  We  provide  interactive \nwebsites, videos, starter guides, frequent \nblog  posts,  user  forums,  and  live  expert \nsupport  to \ninform  webmasters.  Our \npublicly  available  webmaster  guidelines \ncomplement these resources by outlining \nsome  of  the  tips  and  behaviors  that  we \nrecommend webmasters adopt to make \nit  easiest  for  our  systems  to  crawl  and \nindex their websites.20\n\nGoogle Webmaster Guidelines\n\nNot all site owners act in good faith. Since the early days of Google, many have attempted to manipulate their way \nto the top of Search results through deceptive or manipulative behavior, using any insights into the functioning \nof  our  systems  they  can  get  to  try  to  circumvent  them. The  earliest  example  of  such  attempts  dates  back  to \n1999, when Google’s founders published a seminal paper on PageRank, a key innovation in Google’s algorithm.21  \nThe paper described how our algorithms use links between websites as an indicator of authority. Once that paper \nwas published, spammers tried to game Google by paying each other for links. \n\nThese manipulative behaviors aim to elevate websites to users not because they are the best response to a query, \nbut because a webmaster has deceived our systems. As such, they are considered “spam” and run afoul of our \ncore mission. Our webmaster guidelines clearly spell out actions that are prohibited and state that we will take \naction against websites engaging in such behaviors. \n\nWhile  not  all  spammers  engage  in  disinformation,  many  of  the  malicious  actors  who  try  to  distribute \ndisinformation (at all levels of sophistication or funding) engage in some form  of spam. The tactics they use  \nare  similar  to  those  of  other  spammers.  Therefore,  our  work  against  spam  goes  hand-in-hand  with  our  work \nagainst disinformation. \n\nOur algorithms can detect the majority of spam and demote or remove it automatically. The remaining spam is \ntackled manually by our spam removal team, which reviews pages (often based on user feedback) and flags them \nif they violate the Webmaster Guidelines. In 2017, we took action on 90,000 user reports of search spam and \nalgorithmically detected many more times that number.\n\nAs our tactics improve and evolve, so does spam. One of the trends we observed in 2017 was an increase in \nwebsite hacking, both for spamming search ranking and for spreading malware. We focused on reducing this \nthreat  and  were  able  to  detect  and  remove  from  Search  results  more  than  80  percent  of  these  sites  over  the \nfollowing year. \n\nWe continue to be vigilant regarding techniques used by spammers and remain conscientious of what we share \nabout the ways our ranking systems work so as not to create vulnerabilities they can exploit.\n\n14\n\nHow Google Fights Disinformation\n\n\n--- Page 16 ---\n\nGoogle News policies against deceptive content\n\nIn addition to other efforts to fight spam, Google News’ content policies prohibit: \n\n•  Sites or accounts that impersonate any person or organization;\n\n•  Sites that misrepresent or conceal their ownership or primary purpose; \n\n•  Sites or accounts that engage in coordinated activity to mislead users – including, but not limited to, sites \nor accounts that misrepresent or conceal their country of origin or that direct content at users in another \ncountry under false pretenses.\n\nIn addition to algorithmic signals that might indicate such behavior, where there is an indication that a \npublisher may be violating our policies, such as through a user report or suspicious account activity, our \nTrust and Safety team will investigate and, where appropriate, take action against that site and related \nsites that can be confirmed to be operating in concert.\n\nWe provide users with the context and diversity of perspectives  \nthey need to form their own views.\n\nFrom  the  very  beginning  of  Google  Search,  the  very  nature  of  Google  Search  results  pages  has  ensured  that \nwhen looking for information on news or public interest topics they care about, users are presented with links to \nmultiple websites and perspectives. \n\nThis  remains  true  today.  When  users  search  for  news  on \nlinks. \nGoogle,  they  are  always  presented  with  multiple \nIn  many  cases,  they  are  also  presented  with  additional \nelements  that  help  them  get  more  context  about  their \nsearch.  For  instance,  “Knowledge  Panels”  might  show  in \nSearch  results  to  provide  context  and  basic  information \nabout  people,  places,  or  things  that  Google  knows  about. \nFact-check  tags  or  snippets  might  show  below \nlinks  \nin  Google  Search  and  Google  News,  outlining  that  a  specific \npiece of content purports to fact-check a claim made by a third \nparty.22 Or we might call out related searches or questions that \nusers tend to ask about the topic of a search query. \n\nFact-Check on Google Search\n\nLocal Coverage & Timeline in Google News\n\nIn  Google  News,  additional  cues  may  help  users  pick  up  on  points  of  context  that  are  particularly  relevant  to \nNews stories, such as “Opinion” or “User-Generated Content” tags under articles that news publishers want to \nsignal as such; or algorithmically generated story timelines that let users explore at-a-glance the milestones of  \na news story over the weeks or months that led to the day’s events. \n\nDoes Google personalize the content that shows in Google Search and \nGoogle News so that users only see news consistent with their views, \nsometimes known as “filter bubbles”?\n\nWe try to make sure that our users continue to have access to a diversity of websites and perspectives. \nGoogle Search and Google News take different approaches toward that goal.\n\n15\n\n\n--- Page 17 ---\n\nGoogle Search: contrary to popular belief, there is very little personalization in Search based on users’ \ninferred interests or Search history before their current session. It doesn’t take place often and generally \ndoesn’t significantly change Search results from one person to another. Most differences that users see \nbetween their Search results and those of another user typing the same Search query are better explained \nby other factors such as a user’s location, the language used in the search, the distribution of Search index \nupdates throughout our data centers, and more.23 Furthermore, the Top Stories carousel that often shows \nin Search results in response to news-seeking searches is never personalized. \n\nGoogle News: To meet the needs of users who seek information on topics they care about, Google News \naims to strike a balance between providing access to the same content and perspectives as other users \nand presenting content that relates to news topics one cares about. To do this, Google News offers three \ninterconnected ways to discover information: \n\n•  ‘Headlines’  and  ‘Top  Stories’:  To  help  users  stay  on  top  of  the  top  trending  news  in  their  country,  the \n“Headlines” and “Top Stories” tabs shows the major stories and issues that news sources are covering at \nany point in time and shows them to everyone in a non-personalized manner. \n\n•  For You: To help users stay on top of the news that matter to them, the “For You” tab lets them specify the \ntopics, publications, and locations they are interested in so they can see the news that relates to those \nselections. Additionally, and depending on their permission settings, the “For You” tab may show them \nnews they may be interested in in light of their past activity on Google products. \n\n•  Full Coverage: To help users access context and diverse perspectives about the news stories they read, the \n“Full Coverage” feature in Google News lets users explore articles and videos from a variety of publishers \nrelated to an article or news story of their choice. The “Full Coverage” feature is not personalized and is \naccessible in one click or tap from most articles in the “For You” and “Headlines” tabs. \n\nImportantly, for both services, we never personalize content based on signals relating to point of view \non  issues  and/or  political  leanings  –  our  systems  do  not  collect  such  signals,  nor  do  they  have  an \nunderstanding of political ideologies. \n\nWe constantly improve our algorithms, policies, and partnerships,  \nand are open about issues we have yet to address. \n\nBecause the malicious actors who propagate disinformation have the incentive to keep doing so, they continue to \nprobe for new ways to game our systems, and it is incumbent on us to stay ahead of this technological arms race. \nA compounding factor in that challenge is that our systems are constantly confronted with searches they have \nnever seen before. Every day, 15% of the queries that our users type in the Google Search bar are new.\n\nFor  these  reasons,  we  regularly  evolve  our  ranking  algorithms,  our  content  policies,  and  the  partnerships  \nwe enter into as part of our efforts to curb disinformation. \n\nWe are aware that many issues remain unsolved at this point. For example, a known strategy of propagators of \ndisinformation is to publish a lot of content targeted on “data voids”, a term popularized by the U.S. based think \ntank Data and Society to describe Search queries where little high-quality content exists on the web for Google to \ndisplay due to the fact that few trustworthy organizations cover them.24 This often applies, for instance, to niche \nconspiracy theories, which most serious newsrooms or academic organizations won’t make the effort to debunk. \nAs a result, when users enter Search terms that specifically refer to these theories, ranking algorithms can only \nelevate links to the content that is actually available on the open web – potentially including disinformation. \n\nWe  are  actively  exploring  ways  to  address  this  issue,  and  others,  and  welcome  the  thoughts  and  feedback  \nof researchers, policymakers, civil society, and journalists around the world.\n\n16\n\nHow Google Fights Disinformation\n\n\n--- Page 18 ---\n\nYouTube & \nDisinformation\nBackground\n\nYouTube  started  in  2005  as  a  video-sharing  website  and  quickly  evolved  into  one  of  the  world’s  most  vibrant \nonline communities. Thousands, then millions, then billions of people connected through content that educated, \nexcited, or inspired them. YouTube is one of the world’s largest exporters of online cultural and learning content \nand is a significant driver of economic activity, providing many of its creators with the ability to make a livelihood \nby using its services. \n\nDisinformation is not unique to YouTube. It is a global problem afflicting many platforms and publishers. When a \nplatform fosters openness, as we do at YouTube, there’s a risk that unreliable information will be presented. While \ndisinformation has been a problem as long as there’s been news to report, the Internet has made it possible for \ndisinformation to spread further and faster than ever before. We take our responsibility to combat disinformation \nin this domain seriously. To be effective at our size, we invest in a combination of technological solutions with a \nlarge and growing base of human talent. Technology provides scale and speed, while human talent provides the \ncontextual knowledge needed to fine-tune and improve our systems every step of the way.\n\nYouTube  has  developed  a  comprehensive  approach  to  tackling  controversial  content  on  our  platform.  \nThis approach is guided by three principles:\n\n1.  Keep content on the platform unless it is in violation of our Community Guidelines\n\n2.  Set a high bar for recommendations\n\n3.  Monetization is a privilege\n\nFrom  these  principles,  we  create  robust  systems  to  responsibly  manage  all  types  of  controversial  content, \nincluding disinformation. \n\nGiven  how  broad  the  spectrum  of  disinformation  is,  we  implement  the  three  product  strategies  mentioned \nin  our  opening  section  in  ways  that  are  relevant  to  YouTube’s  specific  products,  community,  and  challenges: \n\n•  Make Quality Count\n\n•  We deploy effective product and ranking systems that demote low-quality disinformation and elevate \n\nmore authoritative content\n\n•  Counteract Malicious Actors \n\n•  We rigorously develop and enforce our content policies\n\n•  We protect the integrity of information tied to elections through effective ranking algorithms, and tough \n\npolicies against users that misrepresent themselves or who engage in other deceptive practices \n\n•  We remove monetary incentives through heightened standards for accounts that seek to utilize any of \n\nYouTube’s monetization products\n\n•  Give Users Context\n\n•  We provide context to users via information panels on YouTube \n\n17\n\n\n--- Page 19 ---\n\nWe take our responsibilities as a platform seriously. We believe a responsible YouTube will continue to embrace \nthe democratization of access to information while providing a reliable and trustworthy service to our users.\n\nTackling disinformation on YouTube\n\nGiven  the  spectrum  of  content  and  intent,  it  is  necessary  to  have  a  nuanced  approach  that  strikes  the  right \nbalance between managing our users’ expectations to express themselves freely on the platform with the need to \npreserve the health of the broader community of the creator, user, and advertiser ecosystem. Let’s take a closer \nlook at the three guiding principles on which we base our approach for YouTube:\n\n1.  Keep content on the platform unless it is in violation  \n\nof our Community Guidelines\n\nYouTube’s  Community  Guidelines25  prohibit  certain  categories  of  material,  including  sexually  explicit  content, \nspam, hate speech, harassment and incitement to violence. We aim to balance free expression with preventing \nharmful  content in order to maintain a vibrant community.  Striking this balance is never easy, especially for  a \nglobal platform. YouTube has always had Community Guidelines, but we revise them as user behavior changes \nand as the world evolves. \n\nYouTube also maintains a more detailed and living set of enforcement guidelines that provide internal guidance on \nthe enforcement of the public Community Guidelines. These enforcement guidelines are extensive and dynamic \nto ensure that the policies apply to changing trends and new patterns of controversial content online. YouTube \ndoes not typically disclose these updates to the public because doing so would make it easier for unscrupulous \nusers to evade detection. \n\nTo help formulate rules that are consistent, unbiased, well-informed, and broad enough to apply to a wide scope \nof  content,  YouTube  often  relies  on  external  subject  matter  experts  and  NGOs  to  consult  on  various  issues. \nYouTube  has  also  worked  with  independent  experts  as  a  member  of  the  Global  Network  Initiative  (GNI),26  to \nestablish  key  principles  to  guide  content  review  efforts  and  systems,  including  notifying  users  if  a  video  is \nremoved and allowing for appeals. To honor YouTube’s commitment to human rights, we also make exceptions \nto the Community Guidelines for material that is educational, documentary, scientific, and/or artistic.\n\nConsistent enforcement\nWith  hundreds  of  hours  of  new  content  uploaded  to  YouTube  every  minute,  clear  policies  and  enforcement \nguidelines are only part of what matters. To maintain a site where abuse is minimized, the systems used to curtail \nabuse must scale. YouTube has always relied on a mix of humans and technology to enforce its guidelines and \nwill continue to do so. \n\nYouTube has thousands of reviewers who operate 24/7 to address content that may violate our policies and the \nteam  is  constantly  expanding  to  meet  evolving  enforcement  needs.  Our  review  teams  are  diverse  and  global. \nLinguistic  and  cultural  knowledge  is  needed  to  interpret  the  context  of  a  flagged  video  and  decide  whether  it \nviolates our guidelines. Reviewers go through a comprehensive training program to ensure that they have a full \nunderstanding  of  YouTube’s  Community  Guidelines.  We  use  frequent  tests  as  part  of  the  training  process  to \nensure quality and knowledge retention. Human reviewers are essential to evaluating context and to ensuring that \neducational, documentary, scientific, and artistic content is protected.\n\n18\n\nHow Google Fights Disinformation\n\n\n--- Page 20 ---\n\nWe strive to be as transparent \nas  possible  when  it  comes \nto  actions  we \ntake  on \ncontent  on  our  platform. \nis  why  we  release \nThat \na  Community  Guidelines \nEnforcement Report27 where \nwe give insight into the scale \nand  nature  of  our  extensive \npolicy  enforcement  efforts. \nIt  shows \nthat  YouTube’s \n‘crime  rate’  is  low  –  only  a \nfraction  of  YouTube’s  total \nviews  are  on  videos  that \nviolate company policies.\n\nYouTube flagging and review decisions continuously improves our systems\n\nApplication to disinformation\nThere are several policies in the Community Guidelines that are directly applicable in some form to disinformation. \nThese include policies against spam, deceptive practices, scams,28 impersonation,29 hate,30 and harassment.31\n\nThe  policy  against  spam,  deceptive  practices,  and  scams  prohibits  posting  large  amounts  of  untargeted, \nunwanted,  or  repetitive  content  in  videos,  comments,  private  messages,  especially  if  the  main  purpose  of  the \ncontent is to drive people off to another site. Similarly, activity that seeks to artificially increase the number of \nviews, likes, dislikes, comments, or other metrics either through the use of automated systems or by serving up \nvideos to unsuspecting viewers is against our terms. Additionally, content that exists solely to incentivize viewers \nfor engagement (views, likes, comments, etc.), or by coordinating at scale with other users to drive up views for \nthe primary purpose of interfering with our systems, is prohibited. \n\nOne of the abuses this policy covers is content that deliberately seeks to spread disinformation that could suppress \nvoting or otherwise interfere with democratic or civic processes. For example, demonstrably false content that \nclaims one demographic votes on one day while another votes on a separate day would be in violation of our \npolicies. \n\nAnother applicable policy regards impersonation. Accounts seeking to spread disinformation by misrepresenting \nwho they are via impersonation are clearly against our policies and the account will be removed. For example, if \na user copies a channel’s profile, background, or text, and writes comments to make it look like somebody else’s \nchannel posted the comments, we remove the channel. Impersonation can also occur if a user creates a channel \nor video using another individual’s real name, image, or other personal information to deceive people into thinking \nthey are someone else on YouTube. \n\nYouTube has clear policies against hate and harassment. Hate speech refers to content that promotes violence \nagainst, or has the primary purpose of inciting hatred against, individuals or groups based on certain attributes, \nsuch as race or ethnic origin, religion, disability, gender, age, veteran status, or sexual orientation/gender identity. \nHarassment  may  include  abusive  videos,  comments,  messages,  revealing  someone’s  personal  information, \nunwanted sexualization, or incitement to harass other users or creators. Users that spread disinformation that \nruns afoul of either our hate or harassment policies will be removed and further appropriate action taken.\n\n19\n\n\n--- Page 21 ---\n\n2.  Set a high bar for recommendations\n\nOur primary objective when it comes to  our  search  and discovery systems is to  help people find content that \nthey  will  enjoy  watching,  whether  through  their  Homepage,  Watch  Next,  or  Search  results.  We  aim  to  provide \ncontent that lets users dive into topics they care about, broaden their perspective, and connect them to the current \nzeitgeist. When a user is seeking content with high intent – subscribing to a channel or searching for the video –  \nit  is  our  responsibility  to  help  users  find  and  watch  the  video.  On  the  other  hand,  in  the  absence  of  strong  or \nspecific intent for a particular video, we believe it is our responsibility to not proactively recommend content that \nmay be deemed low quality.\n\nHow our approach to recommendations has evolved\nWhen YouTube’s recommendation systems first launched, it sought to optimize for content that got users to click. \nWe noticed that this system incentivized creators to publish misleading and sensationalist clickbait, and users \nwould click on the video but very quickly realize the content was not something they liked. The system was failing \nto meet our user-centric goals. \n\nTo  provide  a  better  service  for  our  users,  we  began  to  look  at  the  amount  of  time  a  video  was  watched,  and \nwhether it was watched to completion, rather than just whether it was clicked. Additionally, we began to demote \nclickbait. We realized that watchtime was a better signal to determine whether the content we were surfacing to \nusers was connecting them to engaging content they’d enjoy watching. But we learned that just because a user \nmight be watching content longer does not mean that they are having a positive experience. So we introduced \nsurveys to ask users if they were satisfied with particular recommendations. With this direct feedback, we started \nfine-tuning and improving these systems based on this high-fidelity notion of satisfaction. \n\nThe efforts to improve YouTube’s recommendation systems did not end there. We set out to prevent our systems \nfrom serving up content that could misinform users in a harmful way, particularly in domains that rely on veracity, \nsuch as science, medicine, news, or historical events. \n\nTo that end, we introduced a higher bar for videos that are promoted through the YouTube homepage or that are \nsurfaced to users through the “watch next” recommendations. Just because content is available on the site, it \ndoes not mean that it will display as prominently throughout the recommendation engine. \n\nAs  has  been  mentioned  previously,  our  business  depends  on  the  trust  users  place  in  our  services  to  provide \nreliable, high-quality information. The primary goal of our recommendation systems today is to create a trusted \nand positive experience for our users. Ensuring these recommendation systems less frequently provide fringe or \nlow-quality disinformation content is a top priority for the company. The YouTube company-wide goal is framed \nnot just as “Growth”, but as “Responsible Growth”.\n\n20\n\nHow Google Fights Disinformation\n\n\n--- Page 22 ---\n\nBeyond  removal  of  content  that  violates  our  community  guidelines,  our  teams  have  three  explicit  tactics  \nto support responsible content consumption. They are: \n\n•  Where possible and relevant, elevate authoritative content from trusted sources. In areas such as music \nor entertainment, relevance, newness, or popularity might be better signals to tilt our systems to achieve \nthe user’s desired intent and connect them to quality content they’d enjoy. But as we describe in our Search \nsection, in verticals where veracity and credibility are key, including news, politics, medical, and scientific \ndomains,  we  work  hard  to  ensure  our  search  and  recommendation  systems  provide  content  from  more \nauthoritative sources.\n\n•  Provide users with more context (often text-based information) to make them more informed users on \nthe content they consume. On certain types of content, including content produced by organizations that \nreceive state or public funding or topical content that tends to be accompanied by disinformation online, \nwe have started to provide information panels that contain additional contextual information and links to \nauthoritative third-party sites so that our users can make educated decisions about the content they watch \non our platform.\n\n•  Reduce  recommendations  of  low-quality  content.  We  aim  to  design  a  system  that  recommends \nquality  content  while  less  frequently  recommending  content  that  may  be  close  to  the  line  created  by \nour  Community  Guidelines,  content  that  could  misinform  users  in  harmful  ways,  or  low-quality  content \nthat  may  result  in  a  poor  experience  for  our  users,  like  clickbait.  For  example,  content  that  claims  that \nthe  Earth  is  flat  or  promises  a  “miracle  cure”  for  a  serious  disease  might  not  necessarily  violate  our \nCommunity  Guidelines,  but  we  don’t  want  to  proactively  recommend  it  to  users.  Our  incentives  are  to  \nget this right for our users, so we use everyday people as evaluators to provide input on what constitutes \ndisinformation or borderline content under our policies, which in turn informs our ranking systems.\n\nCase Study: Applying Our Principles to YouTube News & Politics\n\nDisinformation in news and politics is a priority given its importance to society and the outsized impact \ndisinformation can have during fast-moving news events. Although news content only generates a small \nfraction of overall YouTube watchtime, it’s a specific use case that is especially important to us. \n\nIn July 2018, YouTube announced product and partnership tactics that directly apply our guiding content \nmanagement principles to news.32\n\nThe  first  solution  included  making  authoritative  sources  readily  available.  To  help  meet  this  goal,  we \ncreated a system to elevate authoritative sources for people coming to YouTube for news and politics. \nFor example, if a user is watching content from  a trusted news source, the “watch next” panel should \nsimilarly display content from other trusted news sources. Assumed within this principle is the demotion \nof disinformation content that we outlined earlier. \n\nThe team has also built and launched two cornerstone products – the Top News shelf and the Breaking \nNews shelf – to prominently display authoritative political news information. The Top News shelf triggers \nin response to search queries that have political news-seeking intent, and provides content from verified \nnews channels. These systems rely on a variety of signals that are derived from Google News and from \nour internal systems when a user might be seeking information on a given topic.\n\n21\n\n\n--- Page 23 ---\n\nThe Breaking News shelf triggers on \nthe YouTube homepage automatically \nwhen there is a significant news event \nhappening in a specific country. \n\nSimilar  to  the  Top  News  shelf,  only \ncontent  from  authoritative  sources \nis  eligible  to  be  displayed  in  the \nBreaking News shelf. \n\nMore  recently,  YouTube  has  been \ndeveloping  products \nthat  directly \naddress a core vulnerability involving \nthe  spread  of  disinformation  in  the \nimmediate  aftermath  of  a  breaking \nnews  event.  After  a  breaking \nnews  event,  it  takes  some  time  for \njournalists  to  create  authoritative \nfact-based video content and upload \nit  to  YouTube,  while  unscrupulous \nuploaders  can  more  quickly  upload \nbizarre conspiracy theories.\n\nTop News Shelf on YouTube Search\n\nBreaking News Shelf on YouTube Home\n\nIn  these  events,  YouTube’s  systems  historically  delivered  the  most \nrelevant content that matched the typed query, and without appropriate \nguardrails would display content from these users seeking to exploit \nthis vulnerability.\n\nThe  first  step  toward  a  resolution  involved  creating  systems  that \ndetermine  when  a  breaking  news  event  might  be  happening,  which \ntilts  results  tied  to  that  event  toward  authority  and  away  from  strict \nrelevance,  popularity,  or  recency.  This  helped  display  content  from \ncredible sources. \n\nFurthermore,  while  authoritative  video  content  takes  time,  credible \ntext-based  reporting  is  much  quicker.  As  a  result,  YouTube  launched \na  product  that  displays  an  information  panel  providing  text-based \nbreaking  news  content  from  an  authoritative  news  source  while  a \nsignificant news event is developing. The information panel also links \ndirectly to the article’s website so that viewers can easily access and \nread the full article about the news event.\n\nInformation Panel Providing Breaking News Context \n\nOnce a critical mass of authoritative news videos has been published \non the topic, Breaking News and Top News shelves begin to take over \nas the primary news consumption experiences on the platform. \n\n22\n\nHow Google Fights Disinformation\n\n\n--- Page 24 ---\n\nThe  second  solution  focuses  on  providing  context  to  help  people \nmake their own decisions. There are certain instances where YouTube \nprovides  viewers  with  additional  information  to  help  them  better \nunderstand the sources of news content they watch. For example, if a \nchannel is owned by a news publisher that is funded by a government, \nor is otherwise publicly funded, an information panel providing publisher \ncontext  is  displayed  on  the  watch  page  of  the  channel’s  videos.  This \ninformation panel indicates how the publisher is funded and provides a \nlink to the publisher’s Wikipedia page. \n\nAnother information panel product that was launched in 2018 aims to \nprovide  additional  factual  information  from  outside  sources  around \ntopics that tend to be accompanied by disinformation online, particularly \non  YouTube.  Users  may  see  panels  alongside  videos  on  topics  such \nas “moon landing hoax” that link to information from credible sources, \nincluding Encyclopedia Britannica and Wikipedia. \n\nInformation Panel Providing Publisher Context\n\nAn  information  panel  providing  topical  context  may  appear  in  Search \nresults or on the watch page of videos. It will include basic, independent \ninformation about a given topic and will link to a third-party website to \nallow viewers to learn more about the topic. This information panel appears alongside all videos related \nto the topic, regardless of the opinions or perspectives expressed in the videos. Information panels do not \naffect any video features or monetization eligibility.\n\nThe third solution involves supporting \nthat \njournalism  with \nallows news to thrive.\n\ntechnology \n\nThese \nissues \nimportant  societal \ngo  beyond  any  single  platform \nand  involve  shared  values  across \nour  society.  The  fight  against \ndisinformation is only as good as the \nquality of news information available \nin  the  ecosystem,  and  are  intent  on \ndoing our part to support the industry \nif we are to truly address the broader \nproblem  of  disinformation.  We \nbelieve  quality  journalism  requires \nsustainable  revenue  streams  and \nthat  we  have  a  responsibility  to \nsupport  innovation  in  products  and \nfunding for news.\n\nInformation Panel Providing Topical Context on YouTube Search and Watch Pages\n\nSeveral years ago, YouTube developed a solution in partnership with key publishers to help newsrooms \nimprove and maximize their video capabilities. The program is called Player for Publishers, and it allows \npublishers  to  use  YouTube  to  power  the  videos  on  their  sites  and  applications.  The  program  is  free   \nand 100% of the advertising revenue for ads sold by the publisher and served on their own properties goes \nto the publisher. \n\n23\n\n\n--- Page 25 ---\n\nsustainable \n\nin  building \n\nIn  addition,  last  year,  YouTube  committed  $25M \nin  funding,  as  part  of  a  broader  $300M  investment \nby  the  Google  News  Initiative,33  to  support  news \norganizations \nvideo \noperations. YouTube announced34 the winners of our \nfirst ever innovation funding program. These partners \nhail from 23 countries across the Americas, Europe, \nAfrica,  and  Asia-Pacific,  representing  a  diverse \nmix  of  broadcasters,  traditional  publishers,  digital \npublishers, news agencies, local media, and creators. \nBest practices gained from this program will be shared publicly via case studies, providing all newsrooms \nthe opportunity to learn and apply insights as we work together to support the development of long-term, \nsustainable news video businesses. \n\nPlayer for Publishers\n\nIn conjunction with this investment, YouTube created a news working group – a quarterly convening of \nnews  industry  leaders  with  whom  we  are  collaborating  to  shape  the  future  of  news  on  YouTube.  The \nnews working group consists of top broadcasters, publishers, creators, and academics around the world \nand they have been providing feedback on items such as how to better quantify authoritativeness, what \nadditional types of information might be useful to provide to users in our information panel projects, and \nwhat more we can do to support online video operations in newsrooms. Given how complex these issues \nare, we know we can’t work in a silo. We must partner with industry and civil society to come together \naround solutions that work.\n\n3.  We view monetization on our platform as a privilege\n\nMany people use YouTube simply to share their content with the world. Creators who meet the eligibility criteria \ncan  apply to join the YouTube Partner Program, which makes their videos eligible to run advertising and earn \nmoney through Google’s advertising products. Monetizing creators must comply with advertiser-friendly content \nguidelines. Advertising will be disabled from running on videos that violate these policies. \n\nOver  the  last  few  years,  YouTube  and  Google’s  advertising  products  have  taken  steps  to  strengthen  the \nrequirements for monetization so that spammers, impersonators, and other bad actors can’t hurt the ecosystem \nor  take  advantage  of  good  creators.  To  apply  for \nmembership  in  the  YouTube  Partner  Program, \nthe  thresholds  were  increased  for  channels  to  be \ndeemed  eligible.  Channels  must  have  generated \n4,000 watch hours in the previous 12 months and \nhave more than 1,000 subscribers. \n\nFollowing  application,  YouTube’s  review  team \nensures \nthe  channel  has  not  run  afoul  of \nmonetization, content, and copyright policies prior \nto  admitting  them  to  the  program.  Only  creators \nwith sufficient history and demonstrated advertiser \nsafety will receive access to ads and other monetization products. In changing these thresholds, YouTube has \nsignificantly improved the protections in place against impersonating creators.\n\nProcess for Admittance to YouTube Partner Program\n\nMore information on how Google protects its monetization services from abuse is discussed in the next section, \n“Google Ads & Disinformation”.\n\n24\n\nHow Google Fights Disinformation\n\n\n--- Page 26 ---\n\nGoogle Advertising  \nProducts & Disinformation\nBackground\n\nGoogle provides multiple products to help content creators – website builders, video makers, and app developers \n–  make  money  from  doing  what  they  love.  Our  advertising  products  enable  creators  to  place  ads  within  the \ncontent they make and manage the process by which they sell space in that content. In addition, we have products \nfor advertisers to purchase that inventory across various content creators.\n\nGoogle  Ads  and  DV  360  help  businesses of  all  sizes  get  their  messages  to  the  audiences  they  need  to  grow. \nThese services are “front doors” for advertisers of all sizes to buy ads across Google’s monetization products \nand platforms – connecting them with billions of people finding answers on Search, watching videos on YouTube, \nexploring new places on Google Maps, discovering apps on Google Play, and more. \n\nAdSense, AdMob, and Ad Manager, support content creators’ and publishers’ efforts to create and distribute their \ncreations. We launched AdSense in 2003 to help publishers fund their content by placing relevant ads on their \nwebsite. Over time, it has become a core part of our advertising products, serving more than 2 million website \nowners around the world.\n\nOur  ads  and  monetization  products  enable  businesses  of  all  sizes  from  around  the  world  to  promote  a  wide \nvariety of products, services, applications, and websites on Google and across our partner sites and apps, making \nit possible for Internet users to discover more content they care about.\n\nWe  also  understand  that  the  content  of  both  ads  and  publisher  sites  needs  to  be  safe  and  provide  a  positive \nexperience for users. We aim to protect users and ensure a positive ad experience across our partner sites and \napps as well as owned and operated properties like Maps and Gmail, by creating clear policies that govern what \ncontent can and cannot be monetized. When we create these policies, we think about our values and culture as \na company, as well as operational, technical, and business considerations. We regularly review changes in online \ntrends and practices, industry norms, and regulations to keep our policies up-to-date. And, we listen to our users’ \nfeedback and concerns about the types of ads they see. \n\nAs we create new policies and update existing ones, we strive to ensure a safe and positive experience for our \nusers.  We  also  consider  the  impact  that  certain  kinds  of  content  will  have  on  our  advertisers  and  publishers. \nFor example, some advertisers do not want their ads shown next to particular types of publisher content, and  \nvice versa. \n\nAt the same time, we are mindful that the advertisers and publishers who use our services represent a broad \nrange of experiences and viewpoints and we don’t want to be in the position of limiting those viewpoints or their \nability to reach new audiences. \n\nOftentimes, these goals are in tension with one another. We aim for a balanced approach that prevents harm to \nour users by putting limits on the types of content we allow to be monetized without being overly restrictive, while \nalso creating clear, enforceable, and predictable policies for advertisers and publishers. \n\nWe have a responsibility to balance the imperatives of making sure we leave room for a variety of opinions to be \nexpressed, while preventing harmful or misrepresentative content on our advertising platforms. \n\n25\n\n\n--- Page 27 ---\n\nTackling disinformation on Google’s  \nadvertising products \n\nThe considerations described above influence the policies we create for advertisers and publishers, and those \npolicies are the primary way by which our advertising platforms implement the strategies to counter disinformation \nthat we mention in the opening section of this paper, including: \n\n•  Counteract Malicious Actors\n\n•  We look for, and take action against, attempts to circumvent our policies.\n\n•  Give Users More Context\n\n•  “Why this ad” labels enabling users to understand why they’re presented with a specific ad and how to \nchange their preferences so as to alter the personalization of the ads they are shown, or to opt out of \npersonalized ads altogether.\n\n•  In-ad disclosures and transparency reports on election advertising, which are rolling out during elections \n\nin the U.S., Europe, and India as our starting point.\n\nGoogle’s  policies  to  tackle  disinformation  on  our  advertising  platforms  favor  an  approach  that  focuses  on \nmisrepresentative or harmful behavior by advertisers or publishers while avoiding judgments on the veracity of \nstatements made about politics or current events. To that end, we have developed a number of policies designed \nto catch bad behaviors, including many that can be associated with disinformation campaigns.\n\nWhile we do not classify content specifically as “disinformation”, we do have a number of long-standing content \npolicies aimed at preventing deceptive or low-quality content on our platforms. These policies complement, and \nbuild on, the strategies we outline in the opening section of this paper.\n\nEach  of  these  policies  reflect  a  behavior-based  approach  to  fighting  deceptive  content.  Rather  than  make  a \njudgment on specific claims, we enforce policies against advertiser and publisher behavior that is associated \nwith misrepresentative or harmful content. \n\nThe policies described in this document are current as of the publication of this paper but are also subject to \ncontinual refinement and improvement to take into account emerging trends and threats to ensure the integrity of \nour platforms and the information we are providing to partners and users.\n\nManaging “scraped” or unoriginal content\n\nIn order to ensure a good experience for users and advertisers, we have policies for publishers that limit or disable \nad serving on pages with little to no value and/or excessive advertising.35 This results in a significant number of \npolicy violations. In 2017, we blocked over 12,000 websites for “scraping,” duplicating and copying content from \nother sites, up from 10,000 in 2016.36 \n\nAlso,  Google  Ads  does  not  allow  advertisements  that  point  users  to  landing  pages  with  insufficient  original \ncontent. This includes content that is replicated from another source without providing any additional value in \nthe form of added content or functionality. For example, a site that consists of news articles that are scraped \nfrom other sources without adding additional commentary or value to the user would not be allowed to advertise  \nwith us.37\n\n26\n\nHow Google Fights Disinformation\n\n\n--- Page 28 ---\n\nMisrepresentation\n\nWe have long prevented ads that intend to deceive users by excluding relevant information or giving misleading \ninformation about products, services, or businesses. This includes making false statements about the advertiser’s \nidentity or qualifications, or making false claims that entice a user with an improbable result. \n\nOur  policies  on  misrepresentation  were  extended  to  content  that  is  available  via  our  monetization  products \n(AdSense, AdMob, and Ad Manager) in 2016, and are publicly available online.38\n\nWe made an additional update to our Google Ads and AdSense policies in 2018 to specifically state that it’s not \nacceptable to direct content about politics, social issues, or matters of public concern to users in a country other \nthan your own, if you misrepresent or conceal your country of origin or other material details about yourself or \nyour organization. \n\nInappropriate content\n\nWe also have long-standing policies to disallow monetization of shocking, dangerous, or inappropriate content \non our advertising platforms, the details of which are publicly available online.39 This includes derogatory content, \nshocking or violent content, or ads that lack reasonable sensitivity toward a tragic event.\n\nPolitical influence operations \n\nAs  discussed  in  a  blog  post  in  August  2018,  we  have  also  conducted  investigations  into  foreign  influence \noperations on our advertising platforms.40 To complement the work of our internal teams, we engage independent \ncybersecurity experts and top security consultants to provide us with intelligence on these operations. Actors \nengaged in these types of influence operations violate our policies and we swiftly remove such content from our \nservices and terminate these actors’ accounts. \n\nElection integrity\n\nWhen it comes to elections, we recognize that it is critical to support democratic processes by helping users get \nimportant voting information, including insights into who is responsible for the political advertising content they \nsee on our platforms. \n\nBeginning  with  the  2018  U.S.  Congressional  midterm  election,  we  require  additional  verification  for  anyone \nwho  wants  to  purchase  an  election  ad  on  Google  in  the  U.S.,  and  require  that  advertisers  confirm  they  are  a \nU.S.  citizen  or  lawful  permanent  resident.41  In  an  effort  to  provide  transparency  around  who  is  paying  for  an \nelection ad, we also require that ad creatives incorporate a clear disclosure of who is paying for it. Additionally, \nwe released a Transparency Report specifically focused on election ads.42 This Report describes who  is  buying  \nelection-related   ads   on   our   platforms   and   how   much   money   is  being  spent.  We  have  also  built  a  searchable \nlibrary  for  election  ads  where  anyone  can  find  election  ads  purchased  on  Google  and  who  paid  for  them.43  \nIn  parallel,  we  updated  our  personalized  ads  policies  to  require  verification  for  all  advertisers  who  use  our \nlimited  political  affiliation  options  to  target  ads  to  users  or  to  promote  advertisers’  products  and  services \nin the United States.44\n\n27\n\n\n--- Page 29 ---\n\nAs  we  look  ahead  to  2019,  we  are  also \nplanning  to  extend  these  election  integrity \nefforts to other elections around the globe. \nSimilar  to  our  approach  for  U.S.  federal \nelections,  we  will  be  requiring  verification \nand  disclosure  for  election  ads  in  the \nEuropean  Union  Parliamentary  elections45 \nIndian  Lok  Sabha  election.46  \nand  the \nthat  mention  a  political  party, \nAds \ncandidate,  or  current  office  holder  will \nbe  verified  by  Google  and  be  required  to \ndisclose to voters who is paying for the ad. \nWe will also be introducing respective Political Ads Transparency Reports and searchable ad libraries for each of \nthese elections that will provide more information about who is purchasing election ads, who is being targeted, \nand how much money is being spent.\n\nThe new political advertising section in our Transparency Report shows how much \n\nmoney is spent across states and congressional districts for U.S. federal elections\n\nIn  addition  to  these  specific  efforts,  we’re \nthinking  hard  about  elections  and  how  we \ncontinue to support democratic processes \naround  the  world,  including  by  bringing \nmore  transparency  to  political  advertising \nonline, by helping connect people to useful \nand  relevant  election-related  information, \nand  by  working \nto  protect  election \ninformation  online.  We  will  continue  to \ninvest  in  initiatives  that  build  further  on  \nour commitment to election transparency.\n\nConsistent Enforcement\n\nThe political advertising section in our U.S. Transparency Report also shows which ads had the highest \n\nviews, the latest election ads running on our platform, and explores specific advertisers’ campaigns\n\nOur enforcement teams use a variety of robust methods to ensure content on our advertising platforms adheres \nto our policies, including machine learning, human review, and other technological methods. This approach is very \nsimilar to the one used by YouTube and described earlier in this paper. We have always relied on a combination of \nhumans and technology to enforce our policies and will continue to do so. \n\nWhen  we  find  policy  violations  we  take  action  to  enforce  our  policies.  Depending  on  the  policy  violation,  this \ncan include blocking a particular ad from appearing and removing ads from a publisher page or site. In cases of \nrepeated or egregious violations, we may disable an account altogether.47/48  Every year we publish a report on our \nefforts to remove bad actors from our advertising ecosystem.49\n\nWe also know that some content, even if it complies with our policies, may not be something that all advertisers \nwant  to  be  associated  with.  That’s  why,  in  addition  to  these  policies,  we  provide  advertisers  with  additional \ncontrols, and help them exclude certain types of content that, while in compliance with our policies, may not fit \ntheir brand or business. These controls let advertisers exclude certain types of content or terms from their video, \ndisplay and search advertising campaigns. Advertisers can exclude whole categories of content such as politics, \nnews, sports, beauty, fashion, and many others. Similarly, publishers can also review and block certain ads from \nshowing on their pages, including by specific advertiser URL, general ad category like “apparel” or “vehicles”, and \nsensitive ad category like “religion” or “politics”. \n\n28\n\nHow Google Fights Disinformation\n\n\n--- Page 30 ---\n\nConclusion\n\nTackling  the  propagation  of  false  or  misleading  information  is  core  to  Google’s  mission  and  to  ensuring  our \nproducts remain useful to the billions of users and partners who utilize our services every day. While we have \nalways fought against malicious actors’ efforts to manipulate our systems and deceive our users, it’s never been \nmore important to thwart them and to ensure we provide our users with information worthy of the trust they have \nin our services. \n\nAs we have outlined in this paper, this is not a straightforward endeavor. Disinformation and misinformation can \ntake many shapes, manifest differently in different products, and raise significant challenges when it comes to \nbalancing risks of harm to good faith, free expression, with the imperative to serve users with information they \ncan trust. \n\nWe  believe  that  we’re  at  our  best  when  we  improve  our  products  so  they  continue  to  make  quality  count,  to \ncounteract  malicious  actors,  and  to  give  users  context,  as  well  as  working  beyond  our  products  to  support  a \nhealthy journalistic ecosystem, partner with civil society and researchers, and stay one step ahead of future risks. \n\nWe  are  constantly  striving  to  make  progress  on  these  issues. This  is  by  no  means  a  solved  problem,  and  we \nknow  that  we  have  room  to  make  progress.  We  welcome  a  constructive  dialogue  with  governments,  civil \nsociety, academia, and newsrooms on what more can be done to address the challenges of misinformation and \ndisinformation and hope that this paper will be useful in sparking these conversations. \n\n29\n\n\n--- Page 31 ---\n\nhttps://www.poynter.org/channels/fact-checking \n\n34  \n\nhttps://youtube.googleblog.com/2018/07/building-\n\nReferences\n\n1  \n\nhttps://europe.googleblog.com/2015/10/\n\nintroducing-accelerated-mobile-pages.html \n\n2  \n\nhttps://www.blog.google/outreach-initiatives/google-news-\n\ninitiative/digital-news-initiative-introducing/\n\nhttps://g.co/newsinitiative\n\nhttps://blog.google/topics/google-news-initiative/\n\nintroducing-subscribe-google/\n\nhttps://jigsaw.google.com/ \n\nhttps://www.blog.google/technology/safety-security/\n\nupdate-state-sponsored-activity/ \n\nhttps://protectyourelection.withgoogle.com/\n\nhttps://projectshield.withgoogle.com/\n\n3  \n\n4  \n\n5  \n\n6  \n\n7  \n\n8  \n\n9  \n\n10  \n\nhttps://transparencyreport.google.com/political-ad \n\n11  \n\nhttps://www.blog.google/around-the-globe/google-europe/\n\nsupporting-european-union-parliamentary-elections/ \n\n12  \n\nhttps://india.googleblog.com/2019/01/bringing-\n\nmore-transparency-to-indian.html \n\n13  \n\nOn January 31st 2019, we have made a dataset of synthetic speech available \n\nto all participants in the third-party and independent 2019 ASVspoof challenge, \n\nwhich invites researchers from all around the world to test countermeasures \n\n30  \n\nhttps://support.google.com/youtube/\n\nanswer/2801939?hl=en&ref_topic=2803176 \n\n31  \n\nhttps://support.google.com/youtube/\n\nanswer/2802268?hl=en&ref_topic=2803176 \n\n32  \n\nhttps://youtube.googleblog.com/2018/07/building-\n\nbetter-news-experience-on.html\n\n33  \n\nhttps://newsinitiative.withgoogle.com/ \n\nbetter-news-experience-on.html \n\n35  \n\nRead more: https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/1346295?hl=en\n\n36  \n\nRead more: https://support.google.com/adsense/\n\nanswer/1348737?hl=en&ref_topic=1261918\n\n37  \n\nRead more: https://support.google.com/adspolicy/\n\nanswer/6368661?hl=en&ref_topic=1626336\n\n38  \n\nGoogle Ads Misrepresentation Policy: https://support.google.com/\n\nadspolicy/answer/6020955 - AdSense misrepresentative content policy: \n\nhttps://support.google.com/adsense/answer/1348688 \n\n39  \n\nGoogle Ads Dangerous or Derogatory Policy: https://support.google.com/\n\nadspolicy/answer/6015406; AdSense Dangerous or Derogatory Policy: https://\n\nsupport.google.com/adsense/answer/1348688?hl=en&rd=1#Dangerous_or_\n\nderogatory_content; AdSense Shocking Content policy: https://support.google.\n\ncom/adsense/answer/1348688?hl=en&rd=1#Shocking_content\n\nagainst fake (or ‘spoofed’) speech.

Given the changes that have occurred\nsince May 2019, it would be good to arrange a teleconference to speak with you in\nthe next week.\n\nCan you please also confirm the AEC’s point of contact at Twitter, if the AEC identifies\nany communications on your platform that breach the Electoral Act.
