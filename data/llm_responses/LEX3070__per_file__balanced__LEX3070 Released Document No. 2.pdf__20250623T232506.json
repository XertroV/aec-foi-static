            "text": "*   **Document Type and Purpose:** This document is a formal request from the Democratic Labour Party (DLP) to the Australian Electoral Commissioner, dated 31 March 2022, seeking a review of the decision to deregister the party under section 137(6)(a) of the *Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918*. This aligns directly with the FOI request for applications made under s 141(2) concerning review decisions.\n\n*   **Key Challenges to AEC Processes:** The DLP raises several substantial objections, strongly echoing themes identified in the FOI request overview:\n    *   **Procedural Unfairness & Denial of Natural Justice:** The DLP alleges it was denied the opportunity to provide additional membership lists and that its explicit requests for permission to do so were ignored, while other parties were seemingly allowed to submit new lists without explicit permission. It contends that the AEC's actions, particularly those of Delegate Joanne Reid, demonstrate inconsistency and potential bias, leading to an unjust assessment.\n    *   **Flawed Membership Verification Methodology:** The document extensively challenges the AEC's statistical sampling method for verifying party membership. The DLP argues that using a sample of only 42 members to conclude on 1572 members is \"questionable from the standpoints of both procedural fairness and legal validity,\" not \"fair\" or \"robust,\" and merely \"indicative rather than definitive.\" It asserts that a definitive assessment requires contacting all provided members, and the AEC's convenience should not supersede democratic rights. This directly supports the FOI request's theme of challenges to the AEC's \"statistically flawed, unfair\" membership verification.\n    *   **Allegations of Discriminatory Treatment:** The DLP expresses concern that \"conservative Christian parties such as the DLP and the Christian Democrats appear to have been singled out for quick deregistration,\" while \"left-leaning secular parties such as “Derryn Hinch’s Justice Party,” the Health Australia Party, and the Australian Progressives (all mentioned in the FOI overview) remained registered despite similar notices. This reinforces the broader FOI request theme of challenges to the AEC's administrative consistency and potential arbitrary outcomes.\n\n*   **Requested Outcome:** The DLP requests immediate re-establishment of its registration and a re-assessment of its entitlement based on a new list of 1650 members provided with the appeal.\n\n*   **Relevance to FOI Request:** This document is a prime example of an application made under s 141(2) and serves as significant evidence for the FOI request's overarching theme: the \"strong theme of challenges to the AEC's administrative processes,\" particularly concerning party membership verification methodology and allegations of unfair or arbitrary deregistration outcomes."

Do not include any conversational filler or preamble.To aid you, the overview of the FOI request is: [REQUEST OVERVIEW START] The FOI request (LEX3070) sought applications made to the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) under s 141(2) of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 during early 2022, concerning reviews of party registration and deregistration decisions. The released documents, primarily communications and a detailed statistical analysis, reveal a strong theme of challenges to the AEC's administrative processes. Key content includes multiple parties (e.g., Democratic Labour Party, Flux, Health Australia Party) arguing that the AEC's party membership verification methodology is statistically flawed, unfair, and results in arbitrary deregistration outcomes, with Flux providing extensive analysis asserting the method is \"rigged.\" Additional challenges include the Australian Progressives alleging a clerical error in their deregistration, an objection to the registration of the David Pocock party based on candidate eligibility and name consistency, and an objection to the Australian Federation Party's logo for potential voter confusion.\n [REQUEST OVERVIEW END] \n\n--- MAIN DOCUMENT TEXT START ---\n\n\n\n--- Page 1 ---\n\nPO Box 678 \nCivic Square \nACT 2608 \n\n31 March 2022 \n\nMr Tom Rogers \n Australian Electoral Commissioner \nLocked Bag 4007  \nCanberra City ACT 2601 \n\nBy email to: commission.secretariat@aec.gov.au \n\nDear Mr Rogers \n\nREQUEST FOR REVIEW OF DECISION \n\nPursuant to section 141(2) of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918, (the Electoral Act), we \nrequest a review of the decision on 4 March 2022 by the Delegate of the Commissioner, Joanne \nReid, to deregister the Democratic Labour Party (the DLP) under section 137(6)(a) of the Act. \n\nIn the first instance, it is of concern to us that amongst many small parties which have received \nNotices of Intent to Deregister, conservative Christian parties such as the DLP and the Christian \nDemocrats appear to have been singled out for quick deregistration while left-leaning secular \nparties such as “Derryn Hinch’s Justice Party” which also received similar notices months before \nthe DLP continue to be registered. It is also of great concern to us that we appear to have been \ndenied natural justice in our efforts to comply with the minimum 1500 member requirement by \nbeing restricted to only providing 1650 names, by having only a tiny sample of these being \ncontacted by the Electoral Commission and then finally by being denied the opportunity to \nprovide any additional lists of members.\n\n\n--- Page 2 ---\n\nOn 27 January 2022 we received a letter from the AEC delegate, Joanne Reid, advising us of the \nintention to deregister the DLP. We were given a month to supply “a statement, in writing, \nsetting out the reasons why the party should not be deregistered.” \n\nShortly after this notice I, as registered officer, had a conversation with a member of the AEC \nwho rang me. I asked what we could include in the statement and was advised we could \nprovide any statement that would explain why we should not be deregistered. I twice asked \nwhether we “can we supply a new list of members” and was advised the statement can contain \nanything that demonstrates why we should not be deregistered. The person I spoke with did \nnot refer to a new list or whether a new list could be supplied.  \n\nOn 26 February 2022, we submitted our statement setting out the reasons why we should not \nbe deregistered including the fact that we did have over 1500 members, The email we sent with \nthe statement specifically asked for permission to submit a new list of names and the \nstatement itself also specifically asked for permission to submit a new list of names.  \n\nWe now find that parties who never asked for permission were permitted to lodge new lists \nalong with their statement and those lists were accepted by the AEC. This despite no reference \nto supplying a new list being mentioned in the “intention to deregister” letter we received and \nno acknowledgment or suggestion that a new list could be lodged being mentioned in my \nphone conversation with the AEC, despite my specifically asking that question. \n\nAt the very least the AEC, who are happy to call and advise us that we are being deregistered, \ncould have called and said a new list would be accepted if supplied within 24 hours. I am \nseriously concerned about impartiality in the AEC when some parties were permitted to lodge a \nnew list supposedly without permission while those who sought permission were ignored, to \ntheir detriment.  \n\nInstead of acting on the request contained in the DLP’s statement and email, the statement \nseems to have been given priority for denial, because barely four business days later we \nreceived the notice of ‘Intention to Deregister.’ Meanwhile, the “Derryn Hinch Justice Party” \nwhich was listed for deregistration on 17 December 2021, the Health Australia Party which was \nlisted on 18 January 2022 and the Australian Progressives which was listed on 11 January 2022 \nall remain on the list of registered parties.  \n\nI would suggest the least the AEC could do is to immediately restore the DLP to the list of \nRegistered Parties while examining the new list of members supplied with this appeal.\n\n\n--- Page 3 ---\n\nAttached to this statement is another list of 1650 members. As mentioned we request we be \nafforded the same treatment as other parties and our qualification for registration be \nimmediately re-established then re-assessed based on this list.   \n\nIn the Notice of Decision on Party Registration dated 4 March 2022, the Delegate, Joanne Reid, \nsimply asserts that she “rejects the reasons outlined by (the DLP) in its statement provided on \n26 February 2022” including both the issue of the legal validity of the sampling process used to \nassess the membership number and the fact that the DLP advised that it has more membership \nnames which it was prevented from providing, without explaining how or why this “rejection” is \ndecided upon.  The fact that the DLP requested permission to lodge another list of members in \nthe very statement the Delegate rejects while other parties, whom the same delegate would \npresumably have dealt with for deregistration purposes, were permitted to lodge new lists \napparently without permission seems to be unfair and suggests the Delegates reasons for \nrejection of our statement are inconsistent with her or the AEC’s actions. \n\nMs Reid declares that she “remain(s) satisfied that the (DLP) does not have 1500 members” \ndespite the fact that we have advised that we have more than the maximum 1650 sample we \nwere permitted to provide, so it is not clear how the Delegate would arrive at this prejudicial \nconclusion when it appears to be at odds with all available facts. \n\nThe use of a sample of only 42 members to draw conclusions regarding the membership status \nof 1572 members would appear to be questionable from the standpoints of both procedural \nfairness and legal validity. In the Notice, the Delegate declares that her faith in the validity of \nthis approach derives from the fact that the Electoral Commission “has previously concluded \nthat the methodology was appropriate for membership testing because it was rational, fair and \npractical in all the circumstances,” however her own organization’s endorsement of its own \nprocess is an entirely circular justification and provides no credibility whatsoever. In fact, from a \nstatistical standpoint, a parametric estimate of valid membership numbers using such a tiny \nsample must have a huge standard error and so can only logically be regarded as indicative \nrather than definitive. \n\nMoreover, the Delegate’s statement that she considers that a statistical estimate “provide(s) a \nmore robust method for ascertaining whether a party has satisfied the requirements of the \nElectoral Act than a statement by the party” appears disingenuous.  \n\nWe did not, nor obviously would anyone else, seriously suggest that an assertion of \nmembership numbers had any weight in assessing eligibility for registration. We merely pointed\n\n\n--- Page 4 ---\n\nout that we had additional members which we could have provided if we had been told that we \nwere allowed to do so. \n\nIn fact, the key question that we raised was neither this nor whether the ABS provided \nestimation method was an effective indicative tool, but rather whether statistical extrapolation \nfrom a sample of only 42 members could be a fair and valid method to decide definitively that a \nparty which supplied 1650 member names did not have 1500 members. \n\nThe DLP would contend that the only way to definitively assess whether a party has the \nminimum 1500 members required by the amended Electoral Act is for the AEC to contact each \nand all of the members provided.  \n\nWhile this may be a major task for the AEC, given that rejection of a party’s claim to the \nrequired membership denies it the right to participate in our nation’s democratic processes, we \nsubmit respectfully that the AEC’s convenience should not be the primary consideration. \n\nAs set out in the Administrative Review Council’s Best Practice Guide to Decision Making, an \nimportant legal requirement in any administrative decision making is to conform to the \nprinciples of natural justice, to the extent that “natural justice generally applies whenever a \nstatute gives power to make an administrative decision that might adversely effects the rights, \ninterests or legitimate expectations of an individual or organization.”1  Moreover, as the guide \nmakes clear, “the requirement of natural justice comes from general administrative law, not \nthe particular statue being administered”2 and these obligations for administrative decision \nmakers are reflected in the Australian Public Service Values and Code of Conduct set down in \nthe Australian Public Service Commissioner’s Directions 2016 and the Public Service Act 1999.      \n\nThe wording of the Delegate’s written decision suggests to us that she may have been \nunfamiliar with these obligations. \n\nIn conclusion, the grounds upon which we request review of the Delegate’s decision are \n\n1.  That in not being advised that we were allowed to submit additional names as part of \n\nour statement on 26 February 2022 as other parties did, we were denied natural justice \nin the decision making process; \n\n1 Administrative Review Council Best Practice Guide 2, “Decision Making: Natural Justice”, 2007, p4 \n2 Ibid, p5\n\n\n--- Page 5 ---\n\n2.  That in not responding to our request for permission to lodge a new list of names, as \n\ncontained in both our email and statement of 26 February 2022, the DLP was denied the \nability to demonstrate our eligibility to registration as was granted to numerous other \nparties; \n\n3.  That the means of statistical extrapolation by which the minimum membership is \n\ndetermined is neither “fair” nor “robust” but merely indicative and therefore does not \ncomply with the AEC’s legal obligations to definitively determine eligibility for \nregistration under the Electoral Act; \n\n4.  That because the AEC failed to contact 1530 of the 1650 members we supplied, the AEC \n\ndenied us a just and equitable assessment of our membership; and \n\n5.  That wording of the Delegate’s written response suggests an apprehended bias against \n\nus and raises the possibility that we were not afforded an objective assessment. \n\nAccordingly we request that our registration be immediately re-established while our ongoing \nentitlement to registration is re-assessed by the Commission, including an assessment of the \nnew list of 1650 member names which we attach.  \n\nYours sincerely \n\nStephen Campbell \nFederal Secretary and Registered Officer \nDemocratic Labour Party\n\n"
