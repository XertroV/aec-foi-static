This included:\n*   The number of designated electors (total, by state/territory, by electoral division) as of a future date (April 7, 2025).\n*   The number of designated elector declarations made in financial years 2022/23, 2023/24, and 2024/25 to date, and who made these declarations (Electoral Commissioner or a delegate).\n*   Data on unique applications for internal review of designated elector declarations and their outcomes (confirmed or set aside) within the same financial years.\n*   Information on unique applications for review to the Administrative Review Tribunal (ART) and declarations ceasing effect by virtue of s 202AH(3) of the Act.\n\n**Documents from the FOI Request:**\nThe 'documents' consist of a single FOI release document (LEX7939) which directly presents the original request questions alongside the AEC's responses. For the first part of the request concerning future-dated designated elector numbers, no specific new document was generated, as stated in a decision letter. However, the AEC included a table of historical designated elector numbers extracted from their public website. For all other questions, direct numerical and descriptive answers were provided within the document itself.\n\n**Main Content from the FOI Request Documents:**\n*   **Future Designated Elector Data (as of 7 April 2025):** No specific document response was provided for this future date. Instead, the document includes a table of historical designated elector numbers per federal electoral event from the 2019 federal election onwards, sourced from the AEC website.\n*   **Designated Electors Declared (by financial year):**\n    *   2022/23: 37\n    *   2023/24: 1\n    *   2024/25 (to date): 211\n    All declarations captured for these years were made by a delegate of the Electoral Commissioner.\n*   **Unique Applications for Internal Review of a Designated Elector Declaration:**\n    *   2022/23: 4\n    *   2023/24: 0\n    *   2024/25 (to date): 4\n*   **Outcome of Unique Internal Review Decisions:**\n    *   2022/23: 4 confirmed\n    *   2023/24: N/A (as no applications were made)\n    *   2024/25 (to date): 3 confirmed, 1 set aside\n*   **Unique Applications for Review to the Administrative Review Tribunal (2024/25 to date):** 0\n*   **Declarations Ceasing to Have Effect by s 202AH(3) (2022/23, 2023/24, 2024/25 to date):** 0"
