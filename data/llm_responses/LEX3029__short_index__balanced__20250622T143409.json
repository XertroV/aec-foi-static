While early independent tests (2016-2017) found no issues replicating the AEC's 2013 WA Senate count, a subsequent 2021 report by Conway and Teague identified significant discrepancies. This report detailed that the AEC's software used tie-breaking rules inconsistent with the Electoral Act, noted the non-implementation of bulk exclusions (which can alter outcomes), and highlighted ambiguities in the Electoral Act concerning the count's termination. The report proposed various legislative and procedural recommendations, including publishing the AEC's code, correcting tie-breaking, and clarifying statutory definitions, to which the AEC subsequently responded."

  "prompt": "Create a concise, single-paragraph summary in markdown format of the following FOI request summary:\n\nSummary:\n\n## Summary of FOI Request Documents\n\nThis summary focuses on documents released in relation to an FOI request, the primary purpose of which appears to be to obtain information concerning the accuracy, methodology, and identified issues or proposed corrections related to the Australian Electoral Commission's (AEC) Senate election counting algorithm and associated scrutiny processes.\n\n### Documents from the FOI Request\n\nThe following documents were released in connection with the request, as listed in \"Attachment A – LEX3029\":\n\n*   **Document 1:** \"For Information: Independent test of senate counts [SEC=UNCLASSIFIED]\" (20/07/2016) - Released in part (S47F – personal privacy).\n*   **Document 2:** \"Bowland’s recounts for various scenarios... [SEC=UNCLASSIFIED]\" (02/08/2017) - Released in part (S47F – personal privacy).\n*   **Document 3:** \"Corrections to the Senate Counting algorithm\" (31/08/2021) - Released in part (S22 – Relevance).\n*   **Document 4:** \"Corrections to the AEC's counting code, and recommended amendments to the Electoral Act, for Senate Counting & Scrutiny\" (31/08/2021) - Released in full.\n*   **Document 5:** \"Research team notes on the Conway Teague paper\" (22/09/2021) - Document withheld (S47C – Deliberative matter).\n*   **Document 6:** \"RE: Corrections to the Senate Counting algorithm [SEC=OFFICIAL]\" (19/10/2021) - Released in full.\n*   **Document 7:** \"Senate Counting and Scrutiny\" (18/10/2021) - Released in full.\n\n### Main Content from the FOI Request Documents\n\nThe documents primarily discuss the verification and potential issues with the AEC's electronic Senate vote counting system, along with recommendations for legislative and procedural changes.\n\n*   **Independent Verification (Documents 1 & 2):**\n    *   In 2016, Grahame Bowland, a WA Greens member, independently developed Python code (`dividebatur`) to replicate the Senate count based on legislation. He found **no issues** with the AEC's results for the 2013 WA Senate election, stating his software exactly reproduced the official count for both initial and recount scenarios. He also tested \"lost\" votes scenarios.\n    *   By 2017, Bowland was still actively running scenarios, including those covering section 44 possibilities (regarding candidate disqualification).\n\n*   **Conway & Teague Report on Corrections and Amendments (Documents 3 & 4):**\n    *   A report by Dr Andrew Conway and A/Prof Vanessa Teague (dated 31/08/2021) was submitted to the AEC, outlining findings on the AEC's Senate count software and the Electoral Act.\n    *   **Identified Errors/Discrepancies:**\n        *   **Tie-breaking:** The AEC's software was found to break ties in a way inconsistent with the Electoral Act, Section 273 31(b). An example from the 2016 WA Senate special election was provided where the wrong candidate (M. Hercock instead of S. Fargher) was excluded due to an incorrect tie-breaking rule application. The report notes such errors could alter election outcomes.\n        *   **Bulk Exclusions:** The AEC has not implemented bulk exclusions (Electoral Act Section 273 (13A)) since 2013, likely under the mistaken belief it cannot alter outcomes. The report demonstrates, with examples, that bulk exclusions *can* change election outcomes due to altered elimination orders and rounding effects.\n        *   **Termination Ambiguity:** The Electoral Act does not clearly define when the distribution of preferences ends, specifically concerning the application of subsections (17) and (18) which deal with the last remaining vacancies. This ambiguity could affect who wins or the order of election. For example, in the 2016 South Australian Senate special election, immediate application of subsection (17) could have led to a different winner (McEwen instead of Gichuhi).\n    *   **Recommendations:**\n        *   **Transparency:** AEC should publish its official code for the Senate count to facilitate scrutiny and allow for alignment with legislation.\n        *   **Correct Tie-Breaking:** Either correct AEC code to follow legislation or amend legislation to match current AEC practice (if code is published).\n        *   **Formalize Tie-Breaking Policy:** Legislate the apparent policy of favoring candidates lower on the ballot in cases of otherwise unresolved ties.\n        *   **Remove Bulk Exclusion:** Remove subsections (13A), (13B), (13C), (13AA), and relevant definitions from the Act to avoid ambiguity and potential for altered outcomes.\n        *   **Clarify Termination of Count:** Remove subsection (17) or clarify it applies only after all paper transfers are complete. Clarify when subsection (18) applies.\n        *   **Audit Digitization Process:** Conduct a rigorous statistical audit of preference data files against physical paper ballots to ensure accuracy and provide public evidence of the process's integrity.\n\n*   **AEC Response (Documents 6 & 7):**\n    *   Document 6 is an email from Kristen Wild (AEC) to Vanessa Teague, confirming the attachment of the AEC's response to the Conway & Teague report.\n    *   Document 7, titled \"Senate Counting and Scrutiny\" (18/10/2021), is the AEC's formal response to the issues raised by Conway and Teague. **The content of this specific document is not provided in the supplied text.**\n\nProvide only the markdown formatted summary text. Do not include any conversational filler or preamble."
