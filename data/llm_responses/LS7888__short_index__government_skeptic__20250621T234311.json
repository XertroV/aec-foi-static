  "prompt": "From a government skeptic's viewpoint, provide a concise, single-paragraph summary in markdown format of the following FOI request overview:\n\nSummary:\n\nThe Australian Electoral Commission's (AEC) response to FOI request LS7888 reveals a troubling lack of transparency, questionable data manipulation, and apparent inefficiency in its Indigenous Electoral Participation Program (IEPP) during 2018-2019.\n\nDespite requests for comprehensive documentation on planning, progress, indigenous involvement, and costs, the AEC released a limited set of emails and internal briefs. Notably absent are detailed planning documents, formal progress reports, any figures on Indigenous people involved in the program's design, and crucially, any information on the final cost or staffing allocated to this \"new methodology.\" This withholding of basic accountability metrics immediately raises suspicions of a deliberate lack of transparency regarding public funds and genuine community engagement.\n\nThe \"new methodology\" itself appears to be less about tangible improvements in Indigenous enrolment and more about an advantageous shift in measurement. Previously, the AEC's own 2014 research indicated an \"alarmingly low\" Indigenous enrolment rate of around 58%. The new approach, leveraging Centrelink data, conveniently presented a dramatically \"improved\" rate of 76.4% in 2018, rising slightly to 76.6% in 2019. However, internal documents reveal this new method relies on \"courageous assumptions\" and produces figures that \"should nevertheless still be regarded as indicative only\" and \"not and cannot be considered 100% accurate.\" The Deputy Electoral Commissioner explicitly warned against the \"critical context\" of these caveats being \"lost over time,\" implying a risk of deliberate misrepresentation at higher levels.\n\nFurther scrutiny reveals significant operational inefficiencies. A key \"enrolment stimulation event\" in early 2019, targeting over 72,000 \"potentially unenrolled Indigenous Australians\" identified through the new data, resulted in a meager 2,646 enrolments—a conversion rate of approximately 3.6%. This constitutes a significant waste of resources on an ineffective outreach strategy. Internal emails also highlight persistent data quality issues, such as \"significant matching error\" for older Indigenous Australians, undermining the very \"robustness\" claimed for the new methodology. Compounding this, a data analyst noted that 2019 enrolment figures initially looked \"strange\" and required a \"fix\" before being reported, raising concerns about the reliability and rigor of internal reporting.\n\nIn essence, the documents suggest that rather than genuinely addressing the deep-seated issues leading to low Indigenous enrolment, the AEC focused on a new, statistically dubious methodology that presented a more palatable picture. The lack of transparent reporting on costs, staffing, and genuine Indigenous involvement, coupled with the demonstrably inefficient outreach efforts and internal data integrity concerns, points to a bureaucratic exercise more focused on managing perception than achieving substantive outcomes.\n\nProvide only the markdown formatted summary text. Do not include any conversational filler or preamble."
