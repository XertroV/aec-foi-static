            "text": "An FOI request concerning \"Client Details\" on the Australian Electoral Commission's (AEC) transparency website revealed that the information is already publicly available. This outcome immediately raises questions about efficiency and genuine transparency. The need for an FOI request to confirm the accessibility of purportedly public information suggests either a significant flaw in the AEC's public information architecture—making 'transparent' data practically undiscoverable—or an inefficient use of FOI resources to process requests for already-published material. This process potentially serves to inflate government claims of transparency by formally \"releasing\" information that was never truly withheld, distracting from areas where genuine opacity or bureaucratic waste may persist."
