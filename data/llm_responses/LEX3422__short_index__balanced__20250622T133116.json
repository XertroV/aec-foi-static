Thus, it defines the procedural handling within the broader framework, referring to other specialized policies for detailed privacy complaint management.\n\n*   **Regarding Online Electoral Roll Management, Unlawful Disclosures, Suspicious Access Detection, and Access Data (Requests 2a, 2b, 3, 4):**\n    *   The \"Complaints Management Procedures\" document **does not contain** specific policies, guidelines, rules, procedures, or measures pertaining to the *management of online access to the Australian electoral roll*, the *detection and prevention of unlawful disclosures of protected information via the AEC’s website*, or *measures to detect suspicious/excessive access* to the electoral roll online. Its focus is on the process of handling complaints about AEC services, not the technical management or security features of online systems or data.\n    *   As a procedural document, it **does not contain** specific data on electoral roll access from narrow IP ranges as requested (Request 4).\n\nProvide only the markdown formatted summary text. Do not include any conversational filler or preamble."
