            "text": "This document is a letter dated 20 March 2021, from an individual to the Australian Electoral Commissioner, formally requesting an internal review of the decision to deregister the Seniors United Party of Australia (SUPA). The letter argues that the AEC's membership testing methodology unfairly disadvantages parties representing an elderly demographic. Specific reasons cited include a higher death rate, prevalence of terminal health issues, increased incidence of dementia or memory loss preventing members from recalling their membership, and an unwillingness among elderly members to answer \"yes\" to questions from strangers over the phone. The document asserts SUPA's unique importance in representing the aged and asks for the deregistration decision to be set aside and the party re-registered, suggesting the current test itself is flawed for this demographic.\n\nThis document is relevant to the FOI request (LEX3177) as it articulates the specific grounds on which SUPA challenged the fairness and practicality of the AEC's membership testing methodology. It outlines the very claims of unfairness (e.g., due to demographics and alleged errors in member verification) that the AEC's \"Commission Paper – Review of the delegate’s decision to deregister the Senior United Party of Australia\" (the primary document sought by the FOI) would systematically address to demonstrate that its methodology was \"rational, fair and practical.\" This letter provides the specific context and detailed objections that necessitated the AEC's defence of its methodology's application."

  "prompt": "Considering this document as part of an FOI request, summarize the document and its relevance to the FOI request in markdown format. Provide only the markdown formatted summary text. Do not include any conversational filler or preamble.To aid you, the overview of the FOI request is: [REQUEST OVERVIEW START] This FOI request (LEX3177) sought documents supporting the Australian Electoral Commission's (AEC) conclusion that its membership testing methodology was \"rational, fair and practical.\" The primary released document, the \"Commission Paper – Review of the delegate’s decision to deregister the Senior United Party of Australia\" (17 Nov 2021), details the AEC's methodology, developed by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) and re-endorsed in 2017, as the foundation for its appropriateness. The paper outlines three membership testing rounds for the Seniors United Party of Australia (SUPA), with initial tests in October 2020 and February 2021 failing to meet the 500-member threshold, leading to deregistration. However, a September 2021 test, conducted during an internal review, successfully verified SUPA's membership, leading to the party's re-registration. The paper also systematically addresses SUPA's claims of unfairness (e.g., due to demographics, alleged errors, lack of scrutineers), asserting the methodology's consistent application, impartiality, and focus on formal membership, thus demonstrating its adherence to the principles of rationality, fairness, and practicality.\n [REQUEST OVERVIEW END] \n\n--- MAIN DOCUMENT TEXT START ---\n\n\n\n--- Page 1 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 2 ---\n\n20 th March 2021 \n\nMr Tom Rogers, \nAustralian Electoral Commissioner, \nLocked Bag 4007, \nCANBERRA \nACT 2601 \ncommission.secretariat@aec.gov.au \nAEC 02 6271 4552 \n\nRequest for an Internal Review of decision to Deregister \n\nthe SENIORS UNITED PARTY OF AUSTRALIA \n\nunder s 141(2) of the Electoral Act \n\nDear Mr Rogers, \n\nMy name is \nand dissatisfied with, the decision by the Australian Electoral Commission to deregister the Seniors \nUnited Party of Australia, ( SUPA).  \n\nand I am the applicant for this review. I am a person affected by, \n\nconsider the reasons below which I feel give a strong argument for the AEC to set aside the decision \nunder review and make a decision in substitution for the decision set aside. That is, to reregister the \nparty. \n\n I ask you to please \n\nThe reasons I feel the AEC should consider are:- \n\nDEMOGRAPHIC  REASONS \n\nBecause of the demographic which the party attempts to represent, that is over 60 years of age, our \nmainly elderly membership suffers a higher than normal attrition rate to other political parties. \n\nSUPA’s high loss of members is due to:- \n\n1.   A much higher death rate than in other political parties, as well as long lasting terminal \n      health issues of members that would stop the aged from participating as a member. \n\n2.   A much higher rate of dementia, or loss of memory, which prevents members recalling that \n      they are members when the AEC calls. This would be a considerable cause for members to \n      answer negatively to membership questions by the AEC representative. ( \n\nOut of scopeOut of scopeOut of scopeOut of scopeOut of scopeOut of scope\n\n\n--- Page 3 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 4 ---\n\nunderstand, of its fear of losing the approximately $1million dollars it receives from the NSW State \ngovernment. Then we have the National Seniors which appears to have agreements with \ncommercial interests. Possibly the best is the Council for the Ageing (COTA) which appears to be \nthe best, but is getting little recognition from the press. \n\nNow it has been suggested there are ten lobbyists for every  parliamentarian in Federal parliament. \nLobbyists that are paid huge amounts and which have huge amounts to advertise to influence public \nopinion in their favour, which can oppose the needs of the elderly, or place the needs of the elderly \nsecondary to making profits. \n\nSUPA is needed to help the Federal government continually see that the requirements of the Aged \nare not being met, and advise the Federal government without a conflict of interest. \n\nREQUEST \n\nConsidering the reasons I have given, including the far higher natural attrition rate of our elderly \nmembers, which the vast majority are, their greater chance of lose of memory, and there \nunwillingness to answer “yes “to questions by strangers  over the phone,   and also the fact that \nSUPA alone represents such a large demographic in Australia’s population, I respectfully ask the \nAEC to please consider these reasons and set aside the failed decision and substitute it with a \npass decision. \n\nThanking you for this review. \n\nADDENDUM \n\nI would suggest that under the present test for registration any party representing the Aged with \nmembers mainly in that demographic would more than likely fail the registration test. I believe even \nmajor political parties could possibly fail the test. \n\nYours Faithfully, \n\nOut of scope\n\n"
