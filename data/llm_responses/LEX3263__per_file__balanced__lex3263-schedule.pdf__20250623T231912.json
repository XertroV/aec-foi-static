Do not include any conversational filler or preamble.To aid you, the overview of the FOI request is: [REQUEST OVERVIEW START] An FOI request (LEX3263) sought data on Australian federal election voting processes in New Zealand over the last four general elections, specifically covering in-person and postal declaration votes at the Wellington High Commission and Auckland Consulate-General, postal votes returned directly to the AEC from NZ addresses, and briefing documents for the decision not to offer in-person voting in Wellington in 2022. Released documents provided this quantitative data and a DFAT minute, revealing Wellington had 0 in-person votes in 2022 (resulting in a significant increase in its postal votes), while Auckland continued in-person voting but also saw a substantial rise in postal votes. Direct AEC postal returns from NZ significantly decreased in 2022. The DFAT minute confirmed the Wellington decision stemmed from a redacted risk analysis and recommendations for overseas voting.\n [REQUEST OVERVIEW END] \n\n--- MAIN DOCUMENT TEXT START ---\n\n\n\n--- Page 1 ---\n\nRequest for: \n\nFOI REQUEST NO.
