The meeting, classified as \"OFFICIAL:Sensitive,\" lists senior AEC personnel as required attendees, including Tom Rogers (the Electoral Commissioner), Jeff Pope, Lynn White, Tim Courtney, Thomas Ryan, and Holly Castro.\n\n**Relevance to FOI Request:**\nThis document is relevant to the FOI request as it indicates high-level internal discussions within the AEC during the period of its active investigation into Andrew Laming MP's Facebook pages. The \"ELT papers\" subject suggests a review or discussion of significant and sensitive matters by the Executive Leadership Team. Given the ongoing nature and public profile of the Laming investigation concerning electoral authorisation laws, it is plausible that updates, strategies, or findings related to this inquiry were among the topics discussed at this senior-level meeting. It provides insight into the internal administrative and decision-making processes of the AEC concerning compliance matters."

Do not include any conversational filler or preamble.To aid you, the overview of the FOI request is: [REQUEST OVERVIEW START] The FOI request disclosed documents detailing the Australian Electoral Commission's (AEC) investigation into Andrew Laming MP's Facebook pages for compliance with federal electoral authorisation laws. This inquiry was triggered by public complaints and media reports, notably from *The Guardian*, alleging Laming used numerous pages (e.g., \"Redland Bay Bulletin,\" \"Redlands Institute\") disguised as community or news groups to promote political content and attack opponents without mandatory disclosures. The AEC confirmed an active investigation, noting 2018 Electoral Act amendments broadened social media authorisation, and issued formal notices to Laming for detailed information and to third parties (like Facebook) for data, with Facebook confirming its cooperation. Findings revealed some pages were removed or updated with authorisation, while others remained active and unauthorised.\n [REQUEST OVERVIEW END] \n\n--- MAIN DOCUMENT TEXT START ---\n\n\n\n--- Page 1 ---\n\nAEC.0002.0001.1987\n\nOrganiser: Terri ThomasSubject: ELT papers + Teams invite (if required) [SEC=OFFICIAL:Sensitive]Required: Tom Rogers; Jeff Pope; Lynn White; Tim Courtney; Thomas Ryan; Holly CastroLocation: Microsoft Teams MeetingStart time: 19 Apr 2021 10:30:00 +1000End time: 19 Apr 2021 12:00:00 +1000________________________________________________________________________________Microsoft Teams meetingJoin on your computer or mobile appClick here to join the meeting<https://teams.microsoft.com/l/meetup-join/19%3ameeting_MTE5ZGQxNGQtYzc1Ny00YzRkLWE2MjQtN2QyYTUwNzNjNzll%40thread.v2/0?context=%7b%22Tid%22%3a%22c1eefc4f-a78a-4616-a218-48ba01757af3%22%2c%22Oid%22%3a%224c860715-0137-491a-aea6-f6bb9aaf8a14%22%7d>[https://www.aec.gov.au/_template/css/img/aec-logo-homepage.png]This meeting invitation was generated by the AEC Microsoft Teams instanceLearn More<https://aka.ms/JoinTeamsMeeting> | Meeting options<https://teams.microsoft.com/meetingOptions/?organizerId=4c860715-0137-491a-aea6-f6bb9aaf8a14&tenantId=c1eefc4f-a78a-4616-a218-48ba01757af3&threadId=19_meeting_MTE5ZGQxNGQtYzc1Ny00YzRkLWE2MjQtN2QyYTUwNzNjNzll@thread.v2&messageId=0&language=en-US>________________________________________________________________________________\n\n"
