(VFUD) by the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) for failing to meet the mandatory 1,500-member threshold. This decision stemmed from VFUD's submitted membership lists failing the AEC's statistical testing methodology, which the party contended was fundamentally flawed, particularly after a procedural error saw the delegate non-randomly test only 1,650 names from a larger 4,680-member list. During the subsequent internal review, the AEC Commission affirmed the deregistration, critically acknowledging that the delegate's non-random testing of the second list was a \"departure from the methodology\" and placed \"no weight\" on its results. However, the deregistration was upheld based on the definitive failure of VFUD's *first* membership test and the party's subsequent failure to provide a properly testable list within the AEC's established, resource-constrained methodology."

  "prompt": "Create a concise, single-paragraph summary in markdown format of the following FOI request summary:\n\nSummary:\n\n## Summary of FOI Request Documents\n\n### 1. Main Purpose of the FOI Request\n\nThe primary purpose of the FOI request was to obtain documents related to the deregistration of the political party VOTEFLUX.ORG | Upgrade Democracy! (VFUD), specifically focusing on the delegate's decision to deregister the party under section 137(6) of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 (the Electoral Act) and the subsequent internal review processes initiated by aggrieved individuals.\n\n### 2. Documents from the FOI Request\n\nThe released documents, as outlined in the \"Schedule of Relevant Documents,\" encompass a range of materials associated with the deregistration and review:\n\n*   **Core Decisions & Notices:** The delegate's notice of decision to deregister VOTEFLUX.ORG | Upgrade Democracy! and the statement of reasons (dated 24 March 2022); a minute recommending deregistration; and subsequent notices from the Electoral Commission regarding internal review outcomes (including one refusal and one affirmation of the deregistration).\n*   **Applications for Review:** Three separate applications for review under s 141(2) of the Electoral Act by individuals challenging the deregistration decision.\n*   **Internal Correspondence:** Emails from AEC Party Registration Section confirming membership status, and communications from the Commission Secretariat requesting further information or inviting submissions for the review.\n*   **Membership Lists & Testing Results:** VOTEFLUX.ORG | Upgrade Democracy!'s submitted membership lists (initially 1,649 members, later 4,680 members); the delegate's letter requesting a list of 1,500-1,650 members; an email instructing the testing of the submitted lists; and the results of the membership testing for both lists.\n*   **Methodology & Policy Documents:** The AEC's \"Guide for registering a party\" (dated 10 September 2021), outlining its membership testing process; Commission meeting minutes endorsing the party registration testing methodology (dated 6 October 2021 and 20 March 2016); an extract of the ABS sample size calculator; advice from the ABS Chief Methodologist on sampling and methodology; and an initial estimate of costs for increasing sample sizes.\n*   **Supplementary Attachments:** Additional supporting documents for the Commission Paper.\n\n*(Note: Several documents were released as \"edited copies\" or \"exempt in full\" due to applicable exemptions such as personal privacy (s 47F) and legal professional privilege (s 42).)*\n\n### 3. Main Content Relating to the FOI Request\n\n**A. Basis for Deregistration:**\n*   VOTEFLUX.ORG | Upgrade Democracy! was deregistered because the AEC delegate was \"satisfied on reasonable grounds that the Party does not have at least 1,500 members,\" a mandatory requirement for non-Parliamentary political parties under the Electoral Act. This conclusion was reached after the party's submitted membership lists failed to satisfy the AEC's testing criteria.\n\n**B. AEC's Membership Testing Methodology:**\n*   The AEC's standard methodology, developed in consultation with the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS), requires parties to submit a membership list of between 1,500 and 1,650 names.\n*   This list is filtered to remove ineligible individuals (e.g., duplicates, those not on the Electoral Roll, or those already supporting another party).\n*   A random sample from the *filtered* list is then contacted to confirm membership. The sample size and maximum number of permissible denials are determined by an ABS-derived formula, aiming for a low probability (<6%) of incorrectly rejecting a valid list and a low probability (<2%) of incorrectly accepting an invalid one.\n*   This methodology was endorsed by the Commission in October 2021, following an increase in the statutory membership requirement from 500 to 1,500 members.\n\n**C. VOTEFLUX.ORG | Upgrade Democracy!'s Membership Tests and Review Applicants' Arguments:**\n*   **First Membership List (December 2021):** VOTEFLUX.ORG | Upgrade Democracy! submitted a list of 1,649 members, which underwent testing and *failed* to meet the required threshold.\n*   **Second Membership List (February 2022) and Procedural Flaw:** In response to the deregistration notice, VOTEFLUX.ORG | Upgrade Democracy! provided a new list containing 4,680 names, challenging the AEC's methodology.\n    *   Crucially, the AEC delegate, departing from standard procedure, instructed staff to test *only the top 1,650 names* from this alphabetically sorted list, rather than drawing a random sample from the entire 4,680 names. This sub-list also failed the membership test.\n*   **Applicants' Core Criticisms:**\n    *   The main applicant (Max Kaye) extensively argued that the AEC's methodology is fundamentally flawed, producing an unacceptably high rate of \"false negatives\" (incorrectly rejecting eligible parties). He contended that limiting submitted lists to 1,650 members ignores parties with \"excess capacity\" (many more members than the limit) and that filtering without replacement further exacerbates error rates.\n    *   The applicant specifically highlighted that the delegate's non-random selection of the \"top 1,650 names\" from the larger list invalidated the second test's results as unrepresentative and statistically unsound.\n    *   Applicants also sought greater transparency, requesting details on individual membership confirmations/denials.\n\n**D. AEC Commission's Internal Review Decision:**\n*   **Standing to Apply for Review:** One application for review was rejected because the applicant was deemed not to be a \"person affected by\" the delegate's decision as defined by the Electoral Act.\n*   **Affirmation of Deregistration:** For the other eligible review applications, the Commission affirmed the delegate's decision to deregister VOTEFLUX.ORG | Upgrade Democracy!\n*   **Key Concession Regarding Second Test:** The Commission *agreed* with the applicants that the delegate's instruction to test *only the top 1,650 names* from the 4,680-member list was a \"departure from the methodology.\" Consequently, the Commission acknowledged that \"no relevant conclusion\" could be drawn from this testing and, therefore, placed \"no weight\" on its results in making its decision.\n*   **Justification for Affirmation Despite Flawed Second Test:** The Commission affirmed deregistration primarily based on the following:\n    *   The *first* membership test (of the 1,649-member list) *did* fail under the AEC's established and endorsed methodology.\n    *   VOTEFLUX.ORG | Upgrade Democracy! did not subsequently provide a new membership list (within the 1,500-1,650 limit) for proper re-testing, despite being invited to do so.\n    *   The untested 4,680-member list, by itself, was considered to have \"only limited persuasive value.\"\n    *   The Commission maintained that its existing methodology, while a \"compromise between a defensible process and a reasonable use of Commonwealth resources,\" remained appropriate. It rejected VOTEFLUX.ORG | Upgrade Democracy!'s proposed alternative methodology (allowing larger lists for testing) due to concerns about its statistical justification for extremely large lists and the significant increase in resources (e.g., a sample size of 564 from a 4,680-member list) that would be required.\n\nProvide only the markdown formatted summary text. Do not include any conversational filler or preamble."
