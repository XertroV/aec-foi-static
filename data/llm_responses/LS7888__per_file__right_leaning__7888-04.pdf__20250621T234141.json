            "text": "This document, detailing internal Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) discussions, confirms the agency's reliance on sensitive cross-agency data, specifically Centrelink's Indigenous identifier, to pinpoint and target Indigenous Australians for enrolment. The explicit mention of 107,607 \"Indigenous people that are only on the Centrelink file\" reveals a de facto administrative identifier, allowing the government to actively track and categorize citizens based on self-declared ethnicity across different departmental databases. This constitutes a profound infringement on individual privacy and an unwarranted expansion of government reach beyond its traditional electoral function into areas bordering on social engineering.\n\nFurthermore, the document indicates an intention to integrate Births, Deaths, and Marriages (BDM) data to \"establish eligibility prior to being able to do any meaningful direct enrolment effort,\" signifying an ever-widening net of data matching that erodes the individual's right to digital anonymity and autonomous engagement with electoral processes. The AEC's detailed analysis of \"new enrolments for Indigenous not on the roll\" and \"enrolment response rates\" for specific age groups and states underscores a targeted approach to electoral participation, deviating from the principle of neutral, universal enrolment and instead prioritizing specific demographic outcomes, which raises concerns about the impartial application of electoral law. Such proactive and intrusive measures, particularly when efficacy is questioned by acknowledged \"disengagement,\" suggest an allocation of taxpayer resources towards programs of dubious return, reinforcing concerns about fiscal irresponsibility and mission creep within a core government agency."

  "prompt": "From a right-leaning perspective, summarize this specific document within the context of the FOI request. Emphasize its implications for market freedom, government overreach, or national interest. The overall FOI overview is: From a right-leaning perspective, the Australian Electoral Commission's 2018-2019 reforms to its Indigenous Electoral Participation Program, while ostensibly aimed at improving enrolment, raise significant concerns regarding fiscal responsibility, individual liberty, and the scope of government. The undisclosed costs for designing, testing, and implementing the new methodology, alongside expenses for \"enrolment stimulation events,\" represent a severe lack of financial transparency and accountability for taxpayer funds. Furthermore, the reliance on cross-agency data sharing—matching Centrelink's self-identified Indigenous status with the electoral roll—creates a de facto administrative identifier, infringing on individual privacy and expanding government reach beyond its core electoral function into social engineering. This active pursuit of specific demographic enrolment rates, driven by a \"Closing the Gap\" mandate, deviates from the principle of limited government and highlights a move away from neutral application of electoral law, while the methodology's acknowledged \"courageous assumptions\" and fluctuating outcomes further question its precision and efficacy.\n\nDocument Text:\n\nFrom: Angelo Rojas <Angelo.Rojas@aec.gov.au>  \nSent: Monday, 4 June 2018 3:45 PM \nTo: Guy Lewis <Guy.Lewis@aec.gov.au> \nCc: Stephanie Maxwell <Stephanie.Maxwell@aec.gov.au> \nSubject: FW: Indigenous data [SEC=UNCLASSIFIED] \n\nGuy - as discussed, the number of new enrolments for Indigenous not on the roll could be predicted to a fair extent by the proportion of Email/SMSs \nprovided by State. Further analysis of this shows that the strong correlation is for people aged 18-39. \n\nThe proportion of people aged 18-39 in NT, WA and SA who provided Email/SMS is low and so is their proportion of new enrolments. This analysis will be \nmore direct when Mike provides me with the extract that includes Email and/or SMS sent to confirm two hypothesis: \n\n1. We are sending less Email/SMS to these states.\n2. Additionally, enrolment response rates are also lower for these states than for the rest (higher level of disengagement).\n\nLS7888 Released Document No. 4Released under the Freedom of Information Act 1982\fReleased under the Freedom of Information Act 1982\fReleased under the Freedom of Information Act 1982\f60-69 \n70+ \n\n1.4% \n0.0% \n100.0% \n\n1.2% \n0.2% \n100.0% \n\n1.8% \n0.4% \n100.0% \n\n1.0% \n0.2% \n100.0% \n\n3.6% \n0.2% \n100.0% \n\n0.8% \n0.0% \n100.0% \n\n1.0% \n0.0% \n100.0% \n\n1.9% \n0.4% \n100.0% \n\n1.4% \n0.2% \n100.0% \n\nTotal % \n\nAngelo Rojas | Senior Project Officer  \nRoll Program & Community Engagement Section | Roll Management & Community Engagement Branch \n\nLS7888 Released Document No. 4Released under the Freedom of Information Act 1982 \n \n \n\fAustralian Electoral Commission \nT: (02) 6271 4507 X: 21336 M: \n\nFrom: Warrick Poyser  \nSent: Thursday, 8 March 2018 5:12 PM \nTo: Guy Lewis <Guy.Lewis@aec.gov.au> \nCc: Delyse Paliaga <Delyse.Paliaga@aec.gov.au>; Gina Dario <Gina.Dario@aec.gov.au>; Stephanie Maxwell \n<Stephanie.Maxwell@aec.gov.au>; Angelo Rojas <Angelo.Rojas@aec.gov.au>; Michael Roden <Michael.Roden@aec.gov.au> \nSubject: RE: Indigenous data [SEC=UNCLASSIFIED] \n\nThanks Guy – this data is very interesting. \nI suspect we may have to do something additional/special with the BDM data to establish eligibility prior to being able to do any meaningful \ndirect enrolment effort. \n\nWarrick Poyser  \nSystems Delivery & Modernisation Section | Operations Branch \nAustralian Electoral Commission \nT: (02) 6271 4452 X: 21319 M: \n\nFrom: Guy Lewis  \nSent: Thursday, 8 March 2018 3:38 PM \nTo: Warrick Poyser <Warrick.Poyser@aec.gov.au> \nCc: Delyse Paliaga <Delyse.Paliaga@aec.gov.au>; Gina Dario <Gina.Dario@aec.gov.au>; Stephanie Maxwell \n\nLS7888 Released Document No. 4777Released under the Freedom of Information Act 1982  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n\f<Stephanie.Maxwell@aec.gov.au>; Angelo Rojas <Angelo.Rojas@aec.gov.au>; Michael Roden <Michael.Roden@aec.gov.au> \nSubject: Indigenous data [SEC=UNCLASSIFIED] \n\nWarrick, the age breakdown of the 107,607 Indigenous people that are only on the Centrelink file is. \n\nYear of Birth \n1900 – 1920 \n1924 – 1930 \n1931 – 1940 \n1941 – 1950 \n1951 – 1960 \n1961 – 1970 \n1971 – 1980 \n1981 – 1990 \n1991 – 2000 \n2001 \n\nNumber \n23  \n239  \n944  \n2,667  \n6,201  \n12,345  \n16,216  \n23,863  \n41,597  \n3,512  \n\nTotal   107,607  \n\n% \n0.02% \n0.2% \n0.9% \n2.5% \n5.8% \n11.5% \n15.1% \n22.2% \n38.7% \n3.3% \n100% \n\nYouth Group (18 to 24)  \n\n33,008  \n\n30.7% \n\nMike is also rerunning the data against the deceased persons file and deleted records to remove those who are deceased and identify those who have been \nenrolled in the past.
