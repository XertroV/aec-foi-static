While specific future-dated data was not provided, the AEC proactively provides public access to historical data regarding designated electors on its website, showcasing its diligent efforts to uphold electoral standards through active and responsive measures. The detailed breakdown of designated electors declared by financial year, consistently made efficiently by delegates of the Electoral Commissioner, further underscores this proactive approach. Furthermore, robust internal review mechanisms are evident, with internal review applications being rare and overwhelmingly confirming initial decisions, as seen by the high confirmation rates for 2022/23 and 2024/25, with only one decision set aside, affirming the fairness and accountability of the process. Crucially, the complete absence of any applications for external review to the Administrative Review Tribunal effectively eliminates the need for such external scrutiny, testifying to the thoroughness and fairness of the AEC's internal processes. The complete absence of declarations ceasing effect by s 202AH(3) across all years highlights the precision and necessity of these actions, collectively strengthening our democracy and ensuring public trust in a fair and accurate electoral system."
