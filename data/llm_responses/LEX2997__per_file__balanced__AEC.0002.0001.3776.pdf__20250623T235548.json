While it does not contain specific details about the investigation into Andrew Laming MP's Facebook pages, its origin from the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) and its reference to an \"Electoral Integrity Committee\" indicate the internal governance structures within the AEC responsible for upholding electoral laws and integrity. This committee would likely oversee or be informed about investigations such as the one described in the FOI request concerning compliance with federal electoral authorisation laws. The mention of a \"Fraud Control Plan\" also generally pertains to maintaining the integrity and lawful conduct of the electoral process."

Do not include any conversational filler or preamble.To aid you, the overview of the FOI request is: [REQUEST OVERVIEW START] The FOI request disclosed documents detailing the Australian Electoral Commission's (AEC) investigation into Andrew Laming MP's Facebook pages for compliance with federal electoral authorisation laws. This inquiry was triggered by public complaints and media reports, notably from *The Guardian*, alleging Laming used numerous pages (e.g., \"Redland Bay Bulletin,\" \"Redlands Institute\") disguised as community or news groups to promote political content and attack opponents without mandatory disclosures. The AEC confirmed an active investigation, noting 2018 Electoral Act amendments broadened social media authorisation, and issued formal notices to Laming for detailed information and to third parties (like Facebook) for data, with Facebook confirming its cooperation. Findings revealed some pages were removed or updated with authorisation, while others remained active and unauthorised.\n [REQUEST OVERVIEW END] \n\n--- MAIN DOCUMENT TEXT START ---\n\n\n\n--- Page 1 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 2 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 3 ---\n\nAEC.0002.0001.3778\n\nPage 3Agenda Paper: Electoral Integrity CommitteeAttachments: Name of attachmentsSummary of changes to Fraud Control Plan (Attachment B)\n\n"
