            "text": "These FOI documents reveal a concerning expansion of government regulatory reach into the operations of a private technology company, Twitter, under the guise of electoral compliance. The Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) is seen attempting to offload its enforcement responsibilities onto Twitter, demanding the company implement content removal or blocking for non-compliant electoral communications and threatening legal action if it fails to do so.\n\nFrom a conservative perspective, this presents several significant deviations from core principles:\n\n*   **Economic Efficiency & Fiscal Responsibility:** The AEC's proposed framework effectively turns Twitter into an unpaid enforcement arm of the government. This imposes significant, uncompensated compliance costs and operational burdens on a private enterprise, diverting resources from innovation and value creation towards government-mandated content policing. It represents a subtle but impactful form of regulatory tax on the private sector, externalizing government expenses rather than transparently funding them through taxpayer dollars. This is fiscally irresponsible for the government, as it avoids direct costs by imposing them on the private sector.\n*   **Individual Liberty & Limited Government:** The most striking deviation is the threat to individual liberty and free speech. The AEC demands Twitter 'remove or block' content that lacks specific government-mandated authorization, including anonymous communications. While the stated aim is transparency—allowing voters to know who is behind a message—the mechanism chosen involves government-coerced censorship by a private platform. This is a significant overreach of government power, compelling a private entity to limit the expression of its users based on regulatory labels rather than factual accuracy (as the AEC notes, the Act 'does not regulate truth in electoral communications'). This actively undermines the principle of limited government by expanding state control over information flow and private sector operations, transforming a platform into a de facto regulatory agent.\n*   **National Security:** These documents do not directly address national security concerns; their focus is on domestic electoral compliance and transparency rather than foreign interference or cyber threats."

At the meeting I said I would provide some \nscenarios on how we can manage electoral communications on Twitter that do not comply \nwith the authorisation requirements in the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 (Electoral \nAct).  The closer the electoral communication is to a Federal election the more urgent it will \nbe to either obtain prompt compliance with the Electoral Act or to block or remove the \nnon-compliant communication.  To this end the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) is \nkeen to agree on the process with Twitter for escalating and resolving any such matters.   \n\nI have set out below three scenarios.  The first two scenarios are the most likely occur, the \nthird scenario will only arise if the AEC is concerned that a communication may breach more \nserious electoral offences in Part XXI of the Electoral Act.  For each scenario I have outlined \nthe actions the AEC will take, when we will contact you and the assistance we will require \nfrom Twitter.  For completeness I have included a summary of the authorisation \nrequirements in the Electoral Act.   \n\nGiven the increasing use of social media by political participants, we are interested in your \nviews on the processes suggested below for escalating and resolving any Electoral Act \ncompliance issues that may arise with electoral communications on social media. \n\nKind regards \n\nAndrew Johnson | Principal Government Lawyer \nElectoral Authorisation Section | Legal & Procurement Branch \nAustralian Electoral Commission \nT: (02) 6271 4759 | M: \n\n7LS7344 Released Document No 4Released under the Freedom of Information Act 1982\n\n\n--- Page 2 ---\n\nAuthorisation of electoral communications on \nsocial media scenarios \n\n1.  Paid electoral advertisement on Twitter without proper authorisation \n\nIssue:  Paid electoral advertisements require an authorisation to allow voters to know who is \n\ncommunicating the advertisement. \n\nActions: \n\nEvent \nUnauthorised electoral ad on \nTwitter  \n\nEntity \nAEC \n\nInadequate response from \nperson or entity responsible \nfor the electoral ad \nAEC notifies Twitter of the \nunauthorised electoral ad \n\nAEC \n\nTwitter \n\nAction \nContact or attempt to contact the person or entity \nresponsible for the electoral ad to advise of the legal \nrequirements in the Electoral Act and ask them to \nrectify or remove the ad. \nNotify Twitter of an unauthorised electoral ad on \nsocial media site. \n\nRemove or block the electoral ad, or contact the \nperson or entity responsible for the ad and advise \nthem to add an authorisation or have the ad \nremoved or blocked. \n\n2.  Anonymous communication on Twitter containing electoral matter \n\nIssue:  AEC unable to determine whether an anonymous communication is electoral matter that \n\nrequires an authorisation under the Electoral Act. \n\nActions: \n\nEvent \nAnonymous communication \ncontaining electoral matter on \nTwitter \n\nEntity \nAEC \n\nInadequate response from \nperson or entity responsible for \nthe anonymous electoral \ncommunication \nAEC notifies Twitter of the \nelectoral communication and the \nneed to settle whether the \nresponsible person or entity is a \ndisclosure entity \nConfirm the person or entity \nresponsible for the electoral \ncommunication is: * \n  not a disclosure entity  \n\nAEC \n\nTwitter \n\nTwitter \n\nAction \nContact or attempt to contact the person or \nentity responsible for the electoral \ncommunication to ascertain whether they are a \ndisclosure entity and advise of the legal \nrequirements for disclosure entities to authorise \nelectoral communications. \nNotify Twitter of an anonymous communication \ncontaining electoral matter and the need to \nascertain whether the responsible person or \nentity is a disclosure entity. \nContact the person or entity responsible for the \nelectoral communication to advise of the \nauthorisation requirements in the Electoral Act.   \n\n  Advise the AEC. No further action. \n\nLS7344 Released Document No 4Released under the Freedom of Information Act 1982\n\n\n--- Page 3 ---\n\n  a disclosure entity  \n\n  Advise the AEC. Remove or block the \n\ncommunication if the responsible person \nor entity does not take action to add an \nauthorisation in compliance with the \nElectoral Act. \n\n*   If Twitter is able to confirm whether a person or entity is a disclosure entity, this will \navoid the need to share personal or commercial information with the AEC.  AEC can \nprovide advice on the categories of a persons or entities that are disclosure entities for \nthe purposes of the Electoral Act.   \n\n3.  Paid electoral advertisement on Twitter that infringes other offences in \n\nthe Electoral Act  \n\nIssue:  In addition to the issues raised above, the AEC may need further details on the person or \nentity responsible for an electoral communication to consider other civil or criminal action \nunder the Electoral Act.  For example it is an offence under section 329 of the Electoral Act to \npublish or distribute or cause to be published or distributed any electoral communication that \nis likely to mislead or deceive an elector in relation to the casting of a vote. \n\nActions:  In addition to the actions outlined above: \n\nEvent \nIncomplete information on the \nperson or entity responsible for \nan electoral communication on \nsocial media \nRequest from the AEC for \ninformation \n\nEntity \nAEC \n\nAction \nSeek information from Twitter about the person \nor entity responsible for the communication. \n\nTwitter \n\nProvide the AEC the requested information. \n\nIn any of the above scenarios, if Twitter is unable to remove or block a communication that does not \ncomply with the Electoral Act or cannot provide information about the person or entity responsible \nfor the communication, then the AEC (or a candidate in an election) may get an injunction under \nsection 383 of the Electoral Act against the person or entity responsible for the communication \nand/or Twitter. \n\nBackground \nThe Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 (Electoral Act) is concerned that voters know who is \ncommunicating an electoral matter to them (electoral communication).  The Electoral Act does not \nregulate truth in electoral communications.  Part XXA of the Electoral Act requires electoral \ncommunications to have an authorisation to inform voters who is responsible for the \ncommunication. \n\nFor a social media communication to be an electoral communication requiring an authorisation \nunder section 321D of the Electoral Act, the communication must: \n\n \n\ncontain electoral matter, and \n\n  be at least one of the following: \n\no  a paid electoral advertisement, \n\nLS7344 Released Document No 4Released under the Freedom of Information Act 1982\n\n\n--- Page 4 ---\n\no  a matter communicated by, on behalf of, a disclosure entity. \n\n‘Electoral matter’ is defined in section 4(1) of the Electoral Act as ‘matter which is intended or likely \nto affect voting in an election’. For the purpose of the authorisation requirements in Part XXA of the \nElectoral Act, paragraph 4(9)(b) clarifies that there must be a sufficient connection between the \nsubject matters of federal elections:  \n\n(9)   Without limiting the definition of electoral matter in subsection (1), matter is taken to be \n\nintended or likely to affect voting in an election if: \n\n(b)    … in Part XXA—it contains an express or implicit reference to: \n\n(i)    the election; or \n\n(ii)   a political party, a branch or division of a political party or a candidate or group \n\nof candidates in the election; or \n\n(iii)  an issue submitted to, or otherwise before, the electors in connection with the \n\nelection. \n\n‘Disclosure entity’ is defined in section 321B of the Electoral Act to be a political party, associated \nentity, member of the House of Representatives, Senator, a candidate or group of candidates in a \nfederal election or other persons or entities who engage in the electoral process and are required by \nthe Electoral Act to provide a return. \n\nFrom: Evan Ekin-Smyth  \nSent: Thursday, 23 August 2018 10:54 AM \nTo: Emily Foat <emilyfoat@twitter.com>; Kara Hinesley <khinesley@twitter.com> \nCc: Tim Courtney <Tim.Courtney@aec.gov.au>; Andrew Johnson <Andrew.Johnson@aec.gov.au> \nSubject: RE: Twitter Follow-up [DLM=For-Official-Use-Only] \n\nThanks Kara and Emily – it was certainly good to meet you both and talk through election \nscenarios.  \n\nKara, I imagine Andrew will send through a specific scenario just to bed in what we were \ntalking about.
