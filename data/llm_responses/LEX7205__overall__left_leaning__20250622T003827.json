            "text": "The FOI documents reveal extensive engagement between the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC), particularly its Electoral Integrity Assurance Taskforce (EIAT) and Defending Democracy Unit (DDU), and major tech corporations including Google/YouTube, Meta (Facebook/Instagram), Microsoft, and TikTok. This collaboration is framed around ensuring \"electoral integrity\" and combating \"misinformation\" and \"disinformation\" ahead of the upcoming Australian federal election.\n\n**Social Justice:**\nThe government's stated aims to safeguard the electoral process and ensure access to \"timely and accurate information\" for voters generally align with progressive values, as informed participation is foundational to a just democracy. Concerns are raised by the AEC regarding content that risks \"disenfranchising Australian voters,\" such as false claims about digital ID requirements for voting. The proactive efforts to protect electoral workers from \"harassment and intimidation\" also resonate with social justice principles, acknowledging the vital role these individuals play in upholding democratic rights.\n\n**Environmental Impact:**\nThese documents do not contain any information directly related to environmental impact or climate change.\n\n**Wealth Distribution and Corporate Influence:**\nA significant theme is the government's profound reliance on private, for-profit tech companies to manage the digital information environment crucial to democratic functioning. This raises serious concerns from a left-leaning perspective, as it implies a transfer of power from public institutions to private corporations whose primary fiduciary duty is to shareholders, not the public good. While tech companies promote their \"corporate civic responsibility\" and tools like \"Democracy Forward,\" these initiatives are ultimately integrated into their commercial strategies. The fact that the AEC must formally request and negotiate access to information, content moderation policies, and even the ability to \"block AI image generation\" of its employees highlights the corporations' gatekeeping power. A notable alignment with progressive values is TikTok's explicit \"prohibition on paid political advertising,\" which aims to limit the influence of wealth in elections, contrasting with Google/YouTube's focus on \"ads disclosures\" for synthetic content.\n\n**Civil Liberties:**\nThe focus on combating \"misinformation\" and \"disinformation\" presents a double-edged sword for civil liberties. While crucial for a fair election, it opens the door to potential overreach in content moderation. The documents show the AEC directly requesting Microsoft to \"block AI image generation of specific AEC employees,\" including those who appeared in public AEC videos. This type of intervention, extending beyond security concerns to image control, signals a troubling expansion of government requests into expressive liberties, potentially setting a precedent for suppressing legitimate, if critical, digital expression.\n\nFurthermore, a proposed amendment to electoral legislation, which would make it an offense to video or audio record in polling places and post it online without permission, is a significant deviation from civil liberties principles. This directly impacts freedom of the press and the public's right to observe and document democratic processes, eroding transparency.\n\nFinally, the extensive redactions throughout the documents (using exemptions like S22, S47E(d), S47F(1), S47G, and particularly S37 for \"Refuse Access\" documents) severely limit public understanding of the specifics of these interactions. This lack of transparency undermines the public's right to know how its government is engaging with powerful corporations on critical democratic issues, fostering an environment where corporate influence could operate with reduced public scrutiny."

Do not click links or \nopen attachments unless you recognise the sender and know the content is safe.  \n\nHi \n\nThank you for your note below and my apologies for the delayed response; just making sure that you have my \ncorrect email address here going forward. \n\nWe are very pleased to provide below the following outstanding updates and information that we discussed in our \nmost recent meetings: \n\nAAP Check the Facts Media Literacy campaign \n\nIn the lead-up to the 2023 Australian Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Voice Referendum, we supported a new \nmedia literacy campaign in collaboration with the Australia Associated Press building on our “Check The Facts” \ncampaign, which ran ahead of the 2022 Federal Election in October 2021 and early 2022. The campaign ran for 6 \nweeks with a combined reach on Facebook and Instagram in Australia of over 10 million users, creating over 40 \nmillion impressions. Further information on the campaign is available on p37 of our latest Transparency Report \nunder the Australian Code of Practice on Disinformation and Misinformation. We also supported AAP to run a new \ncampaign in H2 this year, focused on raising awareness of AI-generated content online. This campaign only recently \nconcluded and we hope to be able to share the results with you in early 2025.  \n\nNetwork disruption efforts to counter the Russian ‘Doppelganger’ group \n\nPlease see a detailed case study outlining this work as well as our wider recent efforts to counter Coordinated \nInauthentic Behaviour on p11 of our latest Transparency Report under the Australian Code of Practice on \nDisinformation and Misinformation, which we submitted through our industry association DIGI in May this year. \n\nMeta’s approach to labelling AI-Generated content and claims regarding the use of AI in political advertising on \nMeta’s platforms during the Indian election \n\nIn April 2024, we announced changes to the way that Meta is handling manipulated media, based on feedback from \nthe Oversight Board and our policy review process with public opinion surveys and expert consultations. This \nincluded adding “AI info” labels to a wider range of video, audio and image content when we detect industry \nstandard AI image indicators or when people disclose that they’re uploading AI-generated content. Further details \non this announcement may be viewed here. \n\nWith respect to advertising, any user who wants to run ads on our services about elections or politics must go \nthrough the authorisation process required on our platforms and is responsible for complying with applicable laws. \nWhenever content on our services - including ads - violates our community standards or community guidelines, we \nremove it, regardless of whether or not it is AI-generated. In the case of the reports specifically raised during this \nyear’s election in India, the authors immediately deleted the ads in question, so we are unable to share any further \ncomment or insight regarding the claims that were made. Leading up to the Australian election, however, we will \nactivate our cross-functional election integrity team to work closely with the AEC and monitor for any violations of \nour policies, including relating to mis and disinformation, hate speech and incitement to violence, in relation to the \nelection process and debate.  \n\n1\n\ns22s47Fs47Fs47Fs47Fs47F\n\n\n--- Page 9 ---\n\nFinally, we thought it might also be useful to share with you a recap by our President of Global Affairs, Nick Clegg, \noutlining our efforts and observations across the 2024 global elections, including in the US, India, Indonesia and the \nEU and in relation to the impact of AI, as well as freedom of expression and combating foreign interference. \n\nWe hope that the above information is useful, but please let us know if you have any follow-up questions. We did \nsee the recent press reports that Commissioner Rogers’ term at the AEC has recently concluded. We wish him all the \nvery best and are sure that his many achievements while in the role were well celebrated ahead of his departure. \nWe look forward to the opportunity to meet with the new Commissioner once they are settled into the role in the \nnew year.  \n\nIn the meantime, we wish you all the very best for a safe and happy holiday season and looking forward to working \nwith the AEC in 2025 and collaborating closely ahead of the upcoming election. \n\nKind regards \n\nHead of Policy, Australia & Head of Policy Programs, Australia, New Zealand & Pacific Islands  \n\nFrom: \nDate: Thursday, 5 December 2024 at 11:52 am \nTo: \nCc: \nSubject: RE: REQUEST : Following up on 2024 action items [SEC=OFFICIAL] \n\n , Defending Democracy Unit , \n\nHi \n\n, \n\nJust checking in with a gentle reminder about the below information we requested a couple of weeks back. \n\nYou must have a lot on your plate given the bills relating to social media that went before parliament over the past \ncouple of weeks!

Matt has not yet received a reply. \n\n29 October 2024 - email \n\n  A follow up question was sent via email (attached) to help inform our Media and Digital Engagement team \nabout approached to AI content labelling. We are yet to receive a response/acknowledgement for this one. \n\nLastly, by way of update, we are working towards circulation of the online platform scenarios early in the new year \nwhich, based on your suggestion, we have further update with AI specific scenarios. We will send an calendar invite \nwhen we have finished workshopping with our EIAT colleagues. \n\nIt’s been a busy year for all of us (for slightly different reasons!), but we’re keen to get some further insights and \ninformation about these items to help us prepare for the next federal election. \n\nPlease let me know if you would prefer to discuss or would like further information or context. \n\nKind regards, \n\n| Assistant Director  \n\nDefending Democracy Unit | Electoral Integrity and Media Branch \nAustralian Electoral Commission \nPhone: \n\n | DDU Group Line: \n\n | Protected email: \n\n3\n\ns47Fs47Fs47Fs47Fs47Fs47Fs47Fs47Fs47Fs47Fs47Fs47Fs47Fs47E\n\n\n--- Page 11 ---\n\nFrom: \nSent: Monday, 13 May 2024 2:52 PM \nTo: Tom Rogers \n\n; Jeff Pope \n\nMichael Lynch \nCc:\nSubject: Re: Meta follow-up \n\n Matthew Haigh \n\nCAUTION: This email originated from outside of the Australian Federal Government.

As we have \nclarity on the timing of the next federal election, we look forward to establishing more regular \nengagements and scenario planning to ensure both of our teams are ready to liaise in relation to emerging \nissues. \n\nWe appreciate that there has been a greater adoption of Generative AI tools in today's society and we look \nforward to working with the AEC and other stakeholders on the potential challenges that they may \npresent. In case it is of interest, I’ve attached our submission to the Department of Industry’s Safe and \nResponsible AI consultation last year. At Meta, we have been working on AI for over a decade and “classic \nAI” is a key part of our content governance and security systems. Additionally, content that has been \ncreated or altered using AI is still subject to our content policies and fact checking initiative.  \n\nThat said, we recognise that new policies and approaches are needed as the use of GenAI becomes more \nwidespread. Since we filed our submission late last year, we have made a number of announcements that \nmay be of interest to you: \n\n4\n\ns47Fs47Fs47Fs47Fs47Fs47Fs47Fs47Fs47Fs47Fs47F\n\n\n--- Page 12 ---\n\n  Adjustments to manipulated media policy: in response to feedback from the Oversight Board, we announced changes \nto how we handle manipulated media. The Board recommended that we broaden the scope of our manipulated media \npolicy, but stop removing manipulated media that do not otherwise violate our Community Standards. \nLabeling AI-generated Images: we have been working with industry to develop both visible markers and invisible labels \nand metadata on images generated by AI tools. \n\n \n\n  AI Ad Disclosure policy: we’ve introduced new disclosure requirements for advertisers using AI or digital methods in \n\nsocial, electoral, or political ads. \n\nAs you may have seen, we are also one of the companies that signed up to the Tech Accord to Combat \nDeceptive Use of AI in 2024 Elections is a set of commitments to deploy technology countering harmful AI-\ngenerated content meant to deceive voters. \n\nAnd in relation to media literacy campaigns and how we measure success, as we mentioned, ahead of the \nVoice  Referendum,  we partnered  with  Australian  Associated  Press  (AAP)  to  launch  a  new media  literacy \ncampaign that shared tips and advice with people so that they could make informed decisions about what \nthey read, trust and share. The campaign videos (examples here and here) were scripted and shot by AAP \nFactCheck journalists and aimed to generate awareness of tactics used to spread mis- and disinformation \nand by driving audiences to check the facts via the AAP Fact Check website. The campaign ran for six weeks \nwith a combined reach on Facebook and Instagram in Australia of over 10 million users, creating over 40 \nmillion impressions.  \n\nThe latest EU campaign that you mentioned is currently being finalised in partnership with the European \nFact-Checking Standards Network and specifically aims to raise public awareness of how to spot AI-\ngenerated and digitally altered content. The campaign is scheduled to launch ahead of the 2024 EU \nParliament Elections next month and will comprise a number of infographics and an explainer video. We \ncan share details of the campaign’s reach and engagement with you when this information becomes \navailable.  \n\nFinally, please let us know if it would be helpful for us to arrange a virtual briefing with our colleague \ndirector on our security policy team, for a more detailed briefing about security trends and issues we’re seeing globally. \n\n, a \n\nKind regards,  \n\n--  \nRegional Director of Policy | Australia, Japan, Korea, New Zealand & Pacific Islands \nM: \n\n | E: \n\nDISCLAIMER: \n\nIf you have received this transmission in error please notify us immediately by return email and delete all \ncopies.

I’m writing regarding recent ABC reporting relating to five Facebook pages said to \nhave been linked to Russian foreign interference in the UK election. I understand these pages have since been taken \ndown by Meta for inauthentic behaviour.  \n\nWhile the material posted was not reported to have received a significant amount of authentic engagement, \nincidents like this present an opportunity for us to learn from real-life events around the world. In order for the AEC \nto consider how we can best prepare ourselves ahead of our next federal election, we are interested in \nunderstanding more about the following: \n\n- We understand that advanced persistent threat (APT) actors will adapt their tactics and change profiles. How is \nMeta dealing with this challenge? Is it anticipated that limitations in detection methods may mean similar material \ngoes undetected in future? \n- When Meta was made aware of the existence of the pages? \n- What steps were involved between being made aware of the pages and their takedown, and how long this took? \n- Whether there were other pages linked to the same network that have also been uncovered and actioned since? \n- Whether the ads review process detected any paid ads from these pages? \n- Whether elections operations centres include team members who specialise in detecting coordinated inauthentic \nbehaviour and counter covert influence operations ahead of electoral events? \n- If there is any further information linking these pages to Russia (beyond the pro-Russian messaging and that \nNigeria is a known base of operations for Russian-linked influence efforts)? \n\nHaving a more fulsome understanding of Meta’s approach to this type of scenario will be very helpful for us to know \nhow best to respond in the event something similar occurs here during our next election. \n\nWe’d be happy to discuss, if needed, and look forward to hearing from you. \n\nRegards \n\nMatt \n\nMatthew Haigh | Assistant Commissioner, Electoral Integrity and Media Branch (CISO & CRO) \nAustralian Electoral Commission  \n X: \n\n M: \n\nE: \n\n for PROTECTED material \n\nDISCLAIMER: \n\nIf you have received this transmission in error please notify us immediately by return email and delete all \ncopies.

Please see below an update from Microsoft on \nmeasures implemented to meet the commitments agreed to as a signatory of the Tech Accord to \nCombat Deceptive Use of AI in 2024 Elections.  \n\nSince the adoption of the Tech Accord in February 2024, Microsoft has made significant strides to \nprevent the creation of deceptive AI targeting elections, enhance detection and response \ncapabilities, and improve transparency and public awareness.  \n\nMicrosoft’s Democracy Forward team works closely with campaigns, electoral commissions and \nother entities around the world to support the integrity of the elections, and Microsoft’s Threat \nAnalysis Center (MTAC) analyses nation-state threats to provide intelligence and insights on \ncyberattacks and influence operations. In 2024, this took us to a range of jurisdictions, including \nTaiwan, India, the UK, the EU and the US.  \n\nWe are bringing this same approach to the forthcoming Australian federal election in 2025. \n\nWe are committed to a set of election protection principles to help safeguard voters, candidates \nand campaigns, and election authorities worldwide. These principles are: \n\n•  Voters have a right to transparent and authoritative information regarding elections. \n\n•  Candidates should be able to assert when content originates from their campaign and have \nrecourse when their likeness or content is distorted by AI for the purpose of deceiving the \npublic during the course of an election. \n\n•  Political campaigns should protect themselves from cyber threats and be able to navigate \n\nAI with access to affordable and easily deployed tools, trainings, and support. \n\n•  Election authorities should be able to ensure a secure and resilient election process and \n\nhave access to tools and services that enable this process. \n\nFurther to our September 2024 progress update, this document sets out further detail on the steps \nwe have and are taking to implement the Accord in the lead-up to Australia’s federal election in \n2025. \n\ns47F\n\n\n--- Page 14 ---\n\nAddressing Deepfake Creation  \n\nWe recognise that companies whose products are used to create AI generated content have a \nresponsibility to ensure images and videos generated from their systems include indicators of their \norigin. One way to accomplish this is through content provenance, enabled by an open standard \ncreated by the Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity (C2PA). Microsoft is a founding \nmember of C2PA and has leveraged this standard (“Content Credentials”) across several of our \nproducts, ensuring that AI generated content is marked as such and that the creator and \ntimestamp of images is recorded.  \n\nSpecifically, Microsoft has added Content Credentials to all images created with our most popular \nconsumer facing AI image generation tools, including Bing Image Creator, Microsoft Designer, \nCopilot, and in our enterprise API image generation tools including Azure OpenAI DALL-E. We \nrecently started testing a Content Credentials display in Word. When images with Content \nCredentials are inserted into Word documents, future viewers will be able to right click and see the \ncredits and author information of these images. In addition, images with Content Credentials \nuploaded to LinkedIn are automatically labeled and the credential information is shown to end \nusers.  \n\nAs important as it is to mark content as AI generated, a healthy information ecosystem relies on \nother indicators of authenticity as well. We launched and expanded our Content Integrity Tools to \nsupport  global elections in 2024 - through the creation of a pilot program that allows political \ncampaigns, elections authorities, and select news media organizations globally, to access a tool \nthat enables them to easily apply Content Credentials to their own authentic images and videos.  \n\nWe also joined forces with fellow Tech Accord signatory Truepic. Microsoft and Truepic have jointly \nreleased an app that simplifies the process of adding Content Credentials to authentically \ncaptured smartphone camera images, video, and audio for participants of the pilot. This app has \nnow launched for both Android and Apple devices and can be used by those enrolled in Content \nCredentials program.  \n\nDetecting and Responding to Deepfakes  \n\nMicrosoft is harnessing the data science and technical capabilities of our AI for Good Lab and \nMicrosoft Threat Analysis Centre (MTAC) teams to better assess whether content—including that \ncreated and disseminated by foreign actors—is synthetic or not. Microsoft’s AI for Good lab has \ndeveloped and is using detection models (image, video) to assess whether media was g enerated \nor manipulated by AI. We can use this detection capability in the context of election campaigns to \nsupport integrity. \n\nWe are also working with our partners at True Media to provide governments, civil society and \njournalists with access to free tools that enable them to check whether an image or video was AI \ngenerated and/or manipulated. Microsoft’s contribution includes providing True Media with access \nto Microsoft classifiers, tools, personnel, and data. These contributions will enable True Media to \ntrain AI detection models, share relevant data, evaluate and refine new detection models as well as \nprovide feedback on quality and classification methodologies.\n\n\n--- Page 15 ---\n\nWe are also empowering candidates, campaigns and election authorities to help us detect and \nrespond to deceptive AI that is targeting elections. In February we launched the Microsoft-2024 \nElections site. This site empowers candidates, campaigns or election authorities to directly report \ndeceptive AI election content on Microsoft consumer services. This reporting tool allows for 24/7 \nreporting by impacted election entities who have been targeted by deceptive AI found on Microsoft \nplatforms.  \n\nTransparency and Resilience  \n\nIn advance of the EU elections we kicked off a global effort to engage campaigns and elections \nauthorities. This enabled us to deepen understanding of the possible risks of deceptive AI in \nelections and empower those campaigns and election officials to speak directly to their voters \nabout these risks and the steps they can take to build resilience and increase confidence in the \nelection. So far this year we have conducted more than 200 training sessions for political \nstakeholders in 23 countries, reaching more than 6,000 participants. We are working closely with \nthe Australian Electoral Commission along with political and media stakeholders in Australia, to \nprovide support in preparation for the next federal election.  \n\nBuilding on this training, we have established a public website entitled “Check, Recheck, Vote,” \nwhich educates voters of the possible risks posed by deepfakes and empowers them to take steps \nto identify trusted sources of election information, look for indicators of trust like content \nprovenance, and pause before they link to or share election content. This includes our ‘Real or \nNot?’ Quiz, developed by our AI for Good lab to expose users to the challenges of detecting a \npossible deepfake. So far, individuals from 150+ countries have taken the quiz. We are exploring \nsimilar activities in Australia.  \n\nProtecting Campaign and Election Infrastructure  \n\nSince the 2016 US election, adversaries have regularly targeted essential systems that support \nelections and campaigns in the US to advance their cyber enabled influence operations. Recent \nIranian hacking incidents involved attempts by these actors to provide stolen or allegedly stolen \nmaterial to the media to propagate narratives of dissent and distrust. This underscores why we \ncontinue to invest in efforts that focus on safeguarding the critical infrastructure that underpins our \nelections.  \n\nOur efforts include several initiatives designed to support election officials and political \norganizations. First, we offer AccountGuard, a no-cost cybersecurity service available to our cloud \nemail customers in 35 countries, including Australia. This service provides advanced threat \ndetection and notifications against nation-state adversaries for high-risk customers, including \nthose involved in elections. AccountGuard extends beyond commercial customers to individuals at \nelection organizations, their affiliates, and immediate family members who may use personal \nMicrosoft accounts for email. We have observed that sophisticated adversaries often target both \nprofessional and personal accounts, amplifying the need for comprehensive protection. More than \n5.4 million mailboxes of high-risk users are now protected by AccountGuard globally.\n\n\n--- Page 16 ---\n\nFor critical election-adjacent systems, such as voter registration databases and voter information \nportals, we provide our Azure for Election service. This service provides proactive security reviews, \nresilience assessments, and load analysis. During the election week, we offer our highest tier of \nreactive support to address any security or availability issues that may arise.  \n\nIn the upcoming election in Australia, as per previous federal and state electoral events, we \nestablish a dedicated escalation point staffed by our team to provide constant management and \ntriage of any election-sensitive issues and maintain real-time communications across our industry \npartners. This ensured that any incidents received the highest level of priority and executive \nsupport.  \n\nWhile we continue to provide robust security services, we recognize that collaboration is essential. \nPublic-private partnerships are crucial in strengthening the entire ecosystem. For example, our \nDemocracy Forward team actively participates in tabletop cybersecurity training exercises \nconvened by US election officials.  \n\nMicrosoft remains steadfast in its commitment to supporting the security and integrity of \ndemocratic processes. Through our comprehensive programs and collaborative efforts, we aim to \nprotect democracy from the evolving threats posed by nation-state actors.  \n\nWe look forward to supporting the AEC during the upcoming electoral period, including through the \nvisit to Canberra in late January by executives from our Democracy Forward team.  \n\nYours sincerely \n\nDirector, Corporate External and Legal Affairs \nMicrosoft Australia and New Zealand \n9 January 2025 \n\ns47F\n\n\n--- Page 17 ---\n\nFrom:\nSent:\nTo:\nSubject:\n\nDefending Democracy Unit \nTuesday, 29 October 2024 11:39 AM\n\nFW: Request for information: blocking Microsoft AI image generation of specific \nAEC employees [SEC=OFFICIAL]\n\n| Assistant Director  \n\nDefending Democracy Unit | Electoral Integrity and Media Branch \nAustralian Electoral Commission \nPhone: \n\n | DDU Group Line: \n\n | Protected email: \n\nFrom: \nSent: Wednesday, 16 October 2024 4:28 PM \nTo:\nCc: Defending Democracy Unit ; \nSubject: RE: Request for information: blocking Microsoft AI image generation of specific AEC employees \n[SEC=OFFICIAL] \n\nHi \n\nThanks for getting back to me so quickly.

Here, we outline seven steps your campaign can take in\nresponse to a abusive or deceptive media attack.\n\nAssess the threat\n\nDetecting abusive or deceptive media is just the beginning; the crucial step is promptly assessing its risk level\nand crafting an appropriate response. Neglecting this can lead to the unchecked spread of false narratives,\nescalating an already challenging situation. Conversely, an overreaction risks amplifying the content, triggering\n\nthe notorious “Streisand effect.”\n\nTo start, evaluate the content's potential impact. While a campaign may dislike Al-generated parodies of their\ncandidate, an aggressive response risks being seen as humorless or suppressing free speech. Objectivity is\ncritical, though challenging. Reviewing the context—platform, tone, and responses—can clarify whether the\n\ncontent is meant humorously or as a factual statement.\n\n  \n\n       \n\ne Ask for retraction Activate supporter Activate supporter\n\nee ee networks to push back networks to push back\n\n« Publiozeement e Consider public e Positive digital\nstatement messaging\n\nActivate supporter Activate supporter\n\npositive diGial ‘\nnetworks to push back —_ networks to push back ositive digital messaging\n\nNothing Nothing Nothing\n\n*Credit: “How campaigns can protect themselves from deepfakes, disinformation, and social media manipulation” by Lisa Kaplan,\nJanuary 10, 2019, brookings.edu\n\nFor content not warranting a serious response, options include ignoring it while monitoring for escalation or\nresponding in a lighthearted manner, which can turn a negative into a positive. However, if the content crosses\nethical or legal boundaries, swift and unified action is necessary to contain its spread and control the narrative.\n\nIn the age of viral misinformation, being proactive is essential. By promptly addressing false claims, you\nestablish your version of events as the initial narrative, potentially inoculating audiences against subsequent\n\nmisinformation.\n\n    \n\nBP Microsoft CampaignSuccess@Microsoft.com\n\n\n--- Page 28 ---\n\nUtilize platform tools and policies\n\n \n\nTo manage abusive or deceptive content on social platforms effectively, start by familiarizing yourself with each\nplatform's content moderation policies and tools. Different platforms enforce varying policies, particularly\nconcerning unlabelled Al-generated content in political contexts.\n\nWhen you spot content violating these policies, promptly report it using the platform's moderation features,\ntypically found as a “report” option on posts. However, keep in mind a few key points:\n\ne Even if content is removed, it is likely to be re-uploaded, sometimes in altered forms, necessitating\n\nongoing monitoring and reporting.\n\nAssign one team member to lead the identification and reporting of incidents of abusive or deceptive content.\nEstablish a process for regular review of both original posts and any amplified dissemination. Meanwhile, your\ncampaign team can continue with subsequent response steps. For Top Platform Policies see Appendix\n\n3 issue initial statements\n\n \n\nWhen confronted with abusive or deceptive media, initiating an immediate statement is pivotal. This initial\nresponse demands clarity and composure, centering on factual data that directly dismantles the falsehoods\nwithout amplifying the abusive or deceptive content. Broad dissemination of this statement is essential,\nspanning all platforms and mediums to encompass every facet of your audience, transcending the point of\norigin. For example, a real video of the candidate might be an important response to a deep fake video. The\nprimary aim is promptly restoring confidence and providing accurate insights, setting the stage for subsequent\n\nmeticulous and strategic measures.\n\n4 utilize social media channels\n\n \n\nEnhance your response strategy by leveraging social media channels effectively. Begin by prioritizing the\nplatform where the misleading content originated, then broaden your reach across similar platforms. For\nexample, if the content surfaced on TikTok, extend your response to Instagram due to their shared user base.\n\nConsistency in messaging is key across all platforms, while delivery methods must be adapted to suit each\n\nplatform's style and audience demographics.\n\nEngage your audience through interactive tactics such as live video streams or Q&A sessions. Direct interaction\nallows for real-time addressing of concerns, empowering you to steer the narrative and effectively counteract\n\nmisinformation.\n\n \n\nFF Microsoft CampaignSuccess@Microsoft.com\n\n\n--- Page 29 ---\n\nEngage with supporters and allies\n\n \n\nDon't underestimate the impact of teamwork. Engaging with allies means boosting the right message together.\nEncourage allies to share accurate information and issue supportive statements, building a network of truth.\n\nEmpower supporters to engage in constructive, fact-driven discussions. Equip them with tools to counter\nmisinformation effectively. Keep the conversation flowing with your audience by providing regular updates on\ndevelopments and campaign actions. This transparency builds trust and reinforces your stance against false\n\ninformation.\n\nHaving your network of surrogates and influencers in place and ready for an incident will save time if one\n\noccurs.\n\n6 JiEngage with opponents\n\n \n\nEngaging with your campaign's adversaries on the topic of abusive or deceptive media demands strategic\nforethought. It's vital to refrain from attributing the creation or spread of abusive or deceptive content to your\nopponent unless solid evidence exists. Keep in mind that campaigns lack full control over their supporters, and\nbaseless accusations may harm your campaign's image and could lead to legal ramifications.\n\nA more prudent approach involves urging your opponent to publicly denounce any abusive or deceptive\ncontent and unite in combating disinformation.\n\n  \n\nork with news outlets and journalists\n\nStrengthening ties with local media outlets and journalists, particularly within your campaign district, is\nparamount long before any abusive or deceptive media incident arises. These established connections facilitate\nswift dissemination of your narrative in critical moments. Prioritize engagement with journalists specializing in\n\ndetecting and debunking abusive or deceptive media.\n\nWhen engaging with the news media, prioritize communicating your message directly to your constituents\nrather than becoming entangled in national political discourse. Enlisting communication experts can offer\nin-depth analysis of abusive or deceptive media, bolstering the credibility of your response.\n\nEffectively presenting your case to journalists and media requires careful organization:\ne Establish a timeline of events detailing the encounter with abusive or deceptive media and any campaign\nor platform responses.\ne Utilize visual aids, such as side-by-side comparisons, to clearly illustrate manipulation.\ne Provide credible references directing journalists to verifiable information or original content that refutes\nthe abusive or deceptive material.\nAdditionally, incorporating personal anecdotes or testimonials from those impacted by the abusive or\ndeceptive media can forge emotional connections with the audience, enhancing resonance beyond factual\n\narguments alone.\n\n \n\nFF Microsoft CampaignSuccess@Microsoft.com\n\n\n--- Page 30 ---\n\nPreparation and prevention\n\nPreventing the malicious use of deepfake and generative Al technology presents a significant challenge. While\nmajor commercial platforms have imposed usage restrictions, open-source models and alternative platforms\noften lack such controls. To address this, initiatives like the Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity\n(C2PA), in which Microsoft played an instrumental role, are pioneering technologies enabling creators to\nembed digital signatures in media, verifying their authenticity and origin. Microsoft's Content Integrity tool\nsimplifies credentialing, allowing users to add verifiable signatures to their content. For more information,\n\ncontact us at campaignsuccess@microsoft.com\n\nWhile C2PA doesn't directly prevent the spread of inauthentic content, it enhances preparedness by promoting\nverified content, facilitating easier differentiation from abusive or deceptive media. Campaigns can proactively\nincorporate content credentialing into their workflows, ensuring all released media contains authentic\n\nsignatures.\n\nAdditionally, campaigns must stay informed about social media policies and reporting mechanisms for abusive\nor deceptive content. Understanding platform nuances is essential for effectively navigating the digital\nlandscape.\n\nMaintaining credibility is crucial when combating disinformation. Campaigns must uphold integrity and\ntransparency to preserve their moral standing, as ethical lapses can undermine their ability to confront attacks\nconvincingly. Upholding ethical practices is paramount for campaigns seeking credibility in the face of\n\ndisinformation.\n\nAnother effective method for preparing campaigns involves staying abreast of the latest developments and\nadvancements in the field. This can be achieved by actively engaging with organizations such as Defending\nDigital Campaigns, which specialize in safeguarding campaigns against various digital threats and challenges.\n\nConclusion\n\nTo tackle abusive or deceptive media and deepfake disinformation, campaigns and organizations must be\nvigilant, prepared, and proactive. By grasping the landscape, readying for potential attacks, educating teams,\nand deploying effective legal and communication tactics, you can lessen the impact of these digital deceptions.\nAddressing individual incidents and fostering integrity, transparency, and critical thinking within your audience\nis crucial. This cultivates a more resilient public discourse, defending against disinformation's spread. Our\nstrategies must evolve as technology advances to safeguard truth and uphold the democratic process.\n\nBP Microsoft CampaignSuccess@Microsoft.com\n\nyr\n\n/\nfs\nz\n\n\n--- Page 31 ---\n\nFrom:\nSent:\nTo:\nCc:\nSubject:\n\nTuesday, 21 January 2025 3:10 PM\n\n; \n\nRE: Administrative/logistics for tomorrow's meeting [SEC=OFFICIAL]\n\nCAUTION: This email originated from outside of the Australian Federal Government.

I’ll \ncheck in with the people who know how to manage this to make sure it’s good to go for next Monday. \n\nAgenda items \nI haven’t put together a formal agenda, but can ﬂag that areas of interest will include the following: \n\n  What has Microso(cid:332) observed or learned in rela(cid:415)on to how electoral integrity* has been \n\nmanaged/maintained globally this year? \n\no  What has happened that you were expec(cid:415)ng? \no  What has surprised you (both posi(cid:415)ve and nega(cid:415)ve)? \no  What could Australia learn from this? \n\n  How has Microso(cid:332) adapted its approach to elec(cid:415)ons based on what it has learned so far this year? \n  What are some useful (or terrible!) approaches to mi(cid:415)ga(cid:415)ng threats to electoral integrity that you have \n\nobserved from other pla(cid:414)orms and/or from other electoral management bodies? \n\n  What are Microso(cid:332)’s insights (if any) into the Sovereign Ci(cid:415)zen movement? \n  How big an impact do you assess AI has had on elec(cid:415)ons to date? \n\no  The existence of AI generated mis and disinforma(cid:415)on, deepfakes etc does not necessarily correlate \n\nwith impact \n\n*We usually consider threats to electoral integrity in terms of cyber, mis/disinforma(cid:415)on, physical threats and foreign \ninterference, but of course there is plenty of overlap between these four areas. \n\nAlso, ONI reps queried whether your teams are aware of ONI’s ongoing discussions to contract support from \nMicroso(cid:332) Threat Intelligence Center (MSTIC) and Microso(cid:332) Threat Analysis Center (MTAC). They didn’t ﬂag any \nques(cid:415)ons or issues but might appreciate an update on whether you are aware of this and how the Democracy \nForward team interacts with the other two. \n\nLastly, Ma(cid:425) is copied in, but I will follow up to ﬂag that \nno doubt he would be keen for a chat. \n\n will be at the conference in Singapore next week. I have \n\nI’ll check in with you again in the next day or two to update you on RSVPs and whether anyone has replied with a \nques(cid:415)on or area of interest to cover. \n\nMany thanks, \n\n3\n\ns 47Es 47Fs 47Fs 47Fs 47Es 47Fs 47Fs 47Fs 47F\n\n\n--- Page 88 ---\n\n| Assistant Director  \n\nDefending Democracy Unit | Electoral Integrity and Media Branch \nAustralian Electoral Commission \nPhone: \n\n | DDU Group Line: \n\n | Protected email: \n\nFrom: \nSent: Friday, September 13, 2024 12:27 PM \nTo: \nCc: \nDemocracy Unit \nSubject: RE: RSVP: in person brieﬁng from MSFT Democracy Forward [SEC=OFFICIAL] \n\n>; Ma(cid:425)hew Haigh <\n\n; Defending \n\n> \n\nCAUTION: This email originated from outside of the Australian Federal Government.

Our team \nreferred this under ‘misinformation’ as follows: \n\nThe video’s claim that “digital identity verification for voting” has been introduced for the 2025 federal \nelection is false. ID is not required when voting in Australian federal elections, and there have been no \nrecent changes in this area. \n\nThe erroneous claim presents the following risks: \n\n Disenfranchising Australian voters who view the video and believe they won’t be able to vote due to \nnot having a digital ID. (Or that they may not be able to vote if they haven’t linked a digital ID to \ntheir enrolment). \n\n Damaging the perceived integrity of Australian federal elections due to the implication voter privacy \n\nmay be compromised. \n\nAs of this morning it’s still up/unlabelled/unmoderated but it was only referred yesterday afternoon. \n\nThe election hasn’t been called yet, but the social media team are already feeling it! \n\nAlso , thanks for the link you shared after our meeting earlier this week.

We appreciate the \nAustralian Electoral Commission's (AEC) ongoing collaboration with online platforms and share your commitment to \nmaintaining public trust in Australia's democratic processes. Google recognises the potential risks AI poses to electoral \nintegrity and welcomes the opportunity to provide an update on our efforts to address these challenges. \n\nGoogle has long been dedicated to supporting democratic processes by: \n\n●  Surfacing high-quality information to voters \n●  Safeguarding our platforms from abuse, and \n●  Equipping campaigns with best-in-class security tools and training. \n\nThese three pillars are fundamental to maintaining public trust in elections and include our platforms and services \nproviding the following: \n\n●  Google promotes information on how to vote on Google Search's landing page to increase voter awareness \n\nand democratic participation. \n\n●  YouTube prominently surfaces content from authoritative sources on the homepage, in search results, and the \n\n\"Up Next\" panel for election news and information. \n\n●  Google monitors and tackles coordinated influence operations through the Google Threat Intelligence group, \nwhich includes intelligence and threat response across Google’s Threat Analysis Group, Cloud Security and \nMandiant teams. \n\n●  For over a decade, Google has leveraged machine learning classifiers and AI to identify and remove content \n\nthat violates policies regarding manipulated media, hate and harassment, incitement to violence, and \ndemonstrably false claims that could undermine democratic processes. \n\n●  Google offers free security services like the Advanced Protection Program and Project Shield to high-risk users \nsuch as campaigners and journalists to ensure they have additional account security protections in place. \n\nAddressing AI-Related Misinformation \n\nWe understand the AEC's concerns regarding the use of AI to spread election-related misinformation and \ndisinformation, including deepfakes and coordinated inauthentic behaviour. Google has implemented several \nmeasures to mitigate these risks across our products and services: \n\n●  AI and Generative AI policies: Google has policies that address misinformation and disinformation in the \ncontext of AI.  For example, YouTube's misinformation policies prohibit technically manipulated content that \nmisleads users and could pose a serious risk of egregious harm.  \n\n Page 1 of 3\n\n\n--- Page 38 ---\n\n●  Ads disclosures: Google requires advertisers to disclose when their election ads include synthetic content \nthat inauthentically depicts real or realistic-looking people or events. This policy applies to image, video, and \naudio content. Google's ads policies already prohibit the use of manipulated media to mislead people, such as \ndeep fakes or doctored content. \n\n●  Content labels on YouTube: YouTube requires creators to disclose when they've created realistic altered or \nsynthetic content and displays a label indicating that the content is synthetic. For election-related content, \nYouTube displays a prominent label on the video player for added transparency. \n\n●  Responsible approach to Generative AI products: Google has prioritised testing across safety risks, \nincluding misinformation, for Generative AI products like Gemini. Google has restricted the types of \nelection-related queries for which Gemini will return responses. \n\n●  Watermarking: Google attaches invisible watermarks to imagery generated by Google's models using \n\nSynthID, a watermarking technology developed by Google DeepMind. \n\n●  Providing users with additional context: \"About this image\" in Search helps people assess the credibility and \ncontext of images found online. The double-check feature in Gemini enables people to evaluate whether \nthere's content across the web to substantiate a Gemini response. \n\nProgress Against the Tech Accord Commitments \n\nGoogle was among the original signatories of the Tech Accord to Combat Deceptive Use of AI in 2024 Elections. In line \nwith our commitments, we have taken steps across our products to reduce the risks that deceptive AI election content \nmay pose to the integrity of electoral processes. These steps include: \n\n●  Developing Model Cards to promote transparency and a shared understanding of AI models \n●  Addressing harmful content through Google's AI Prohibited Use Policy \n●  Proactively testing systems using AI-Assisted Red Teaming \n●  Restricting responses for election-related queries across many Generative AI consumer apps and experiences \n●  Expanding the SynthID watermarking toolkit to more Generative AI tools and more forms of media \n●  Requiring election advertisers to prominently disclose when their ads include realistic synthetic content \n●  Adding Google-generated disclosures for some YouTube Election Ads formats, and \n●  Actively exploring ways to incorporate Content Credentials into our own products and services, including Ads, \n\nSearch, and YouTube, as a Steering Committee member of the C2PA Coalition and Standard. \n\nCollaboration and Transparency \n\nGoogle is committed to transparency and collaboration with industry, government, and civil society. We actively share \nour learnings and expertise with researchers and others in the industry. We engage and collaborate with organisations \nsuch as the Partnership on AI, ML Commons, and the Frontier Model Forum. We also support the Global Fact Check \nFund and numerous civil society, research, and media literacy efforts. \n\nLooking Ahead \n\nGoogle's efforts around elections are not limited to a specific timeframe or region. We will continue to support and \nprotect elections around the world and in Australia by: \n\n●  Surfacing high-quality information to voters \n●  Safeguarding our platforms from abuse \n●  Equipping campaigns with best-in-class security tools and training \n●  Applying new learnings to improve our protections for harmful content and create trustworthy experiences \n●  Leveraging machine learning classifiers and AI to identify and remove content that violates our policies, and \n●  Taking a principled and responsible approach to introducing generative AI products. \n\n Page 2 of 3\n\n\n--- Page 39 ---\n\nWe are dedicated to working with the AEC to address the challenges posed by Al and uphold the Australian public's\ntrust in democratic processes and institutions. We value our ongoing relationship and have welcomed the frequent\nand ongoing engagement with members of the AEC from the Defending Democracy Unit and beyond. We will continue\nto work closely with the AEC to ensure these efforts are understood and that appropriate pathways for escalation and\nengagement are in place ahead of the upcoming Federal Election.\n\nWe look forward to continuing our collaboration.\n\n   \n\nSincerely,\nGovernment Affairs and Public Policy Government Affairs and Public Policy\n\nPage 3 of 3\n\n\n--- Page 40 ---\n\nFrom:\nSent:\nTo:\nCc:\nSubject:\n\nHi \n\n, \n\nMonday, 9 December 2024 10:36 AM\n\nRE: Action items from October meeting, including proposed dates for December \nmeeting [SEC=OFFICIAL]\n\nThanks for your reply.

I thought it \nwould be good to follow up on a few action items from our last meeting before December arrives, as \nfollows. \n\nInformation session \n\n \n\n- at our last meeting you kindly offered to set up an information quality session to outline how \nGoogle search worked, including an element on searches in Gemini. We would like to take you up \non that offer.  \n\no  Please let me know what time frames/notice you need to set this up and I would be happy \n\nto set up some meeting invites \n\no  If we work a couple of weeks in advance, most of our working level attendees will be free to \n\nattend \n\nGemini’s incorrect answer about enrolling to vote \n\n \n\n- on 23 October we flagged that Gemini was producing an incorrect answer to the question \n“Can I be enrolled to vote if I haven’t completed and enrolment form?”. It appears that Gemini \nnow declines to respond this prompt, instead providing the scripted answer in relation to not \nbeing able to help with elections. I’m not sure if this is based on action you have taken in the \nbackground, if so, thanks and noted! \n\n  For a gold star from us it would be great if Gemini provided a link to the AEC’s website when \n\nAustralian users submit queries about elections, although there is some nuance to this given we \nhave state electoral management bodies to consider too. We also understand these things are not \nalways as easy as they sound. Happy to discuss at our next meeting if this is something you think \ncould be pursued. \n\nNext meeting - December 2024 \n\n  At our last meeting on 23 October, it was agreed it would be useful to set up a post US election \n\nmeeting before we all break for Christmas. Available times in December include: \n\no  Monday, 16 December                   9.30am to 11.00am \no  Monday, 16 December                   1pm to 2pm \n\n3\n\ns47Fs47Fs47Fs47F\n\n\n--- Page 43 ---\n\no  Tuesday, 17 December                   1pm to 2pm \no  Wednesday, 18 December            9.30am to 10.30am \no  Wednesday, 18 December            1pm to 2pm \no  Friday, 20 December                       9.30am to 12pm \no  Friday, 20 December                       1pm to 2pm \n\nNo problem if this is not a good week in the lead up to Christmas, just give me a steer on a better \nweek and I’ll consult calendars accordingly. \n\n  We will send out an agenda prior the next meeting but note the following from our last meeting. \n\no \n\no \n\n offered to brief on Google’s approach to AI in elections after gaining insight from \n\nthe US presidential election on 5 November \n\n offered to provide more information about how content provenance works on \n\ncontent uploaded to YouTube at next meeting \n\no  Google and YouTube to provide information and insights into Sovereign Citizen promotion \n\nof misinformation/disinformation respective platforms \n\no  Google and YouTube support for the next Australian federal election \no  AEC to share trends in the election information environment with Google and YouTube \n\nLastly, no doubt you are already aware of the Electoral Legislation Amendment (Electoral Reform) Bill \n2024 currently being considered. In case you are not already aware, there is a proposed amendment to \nsection 348 (Control of behaviour at polling booths etc.) of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 that \nprovides: \n\n(1A) A person commits an offence if:  \n\n(a)          the person makes an audio or video recording in premises to which this section \napplies; and \n\n(b)          the recording is made without the permission of the person in charge of the \npremises; and  \n\n(c)           the making of the recording constitutes a contravention of paragraph 348(1)(a); \nand  \n\n(d)          the person:  \n\n(i)            publishes the whole or a part of the recording; or  \n\n(ii)           causes to be published the whole or a part of the recording.  \n\nPenalty: 5 penalty units. \n\n4\n\ns47Fs47F\n\n\n--- Page 44 ---\n\nEssentially, it will be an offence to get your phone out and video or audio record in a polling place or \ncounting centre and post it online without the permission of the officer in charge. Some of the content \nposted online that the AEC was concerned about during past events would be covered by this if/when it \nenacted. Flagging now ahead of our next meeting for discussion. \n\nApologies for the lengthy email.

We would therefore like to arrange a meeting with you (and/or appropriate \nrepresentatives as you see fit) in preparation. \n\nGiven you will likely be quite busy in the lead up to the US Presidential election on 5 November, we \nwould like to propose a meeting this month. \n\nAt this meeting we would be interested in covering: \n\n an update from the AEC on Australia’s electoral integrity environment \n\n an update from Google/YouTube about your observations and lessons learned from \nrecent elections around the globe and how these experiences are shaping your work \n\n how Google/YouTube are responding to electoral integrity risks, with a particular \nfocus on how we can ensure the Australian public has access to timely and accurate \ninformation about the electoral process \n\n confirming the options and/or escalation pathways for the EIAT and the AEC to flag \npotential issues with Google/YouTube in relation to Australian federal electoral \nevents \n\n discuss the (FE24/25) version of the Online Platform Scenarios, which, although \nsimilar to the Referendum scenarios, has had some updates \n\nGrateful if you could please advise which (if any) of the following dates would be suitable for a \nSeptember meeting.  \n\nWe would be aiming for a one-hour window within the following times. \n\n3\n\ns47Fs47Fs47Fs47Fs47Fs47F\n\n\n--- Page 54 ---\n\nTuesday, 17 September 8am to 9.30am \n\nWednesday, 18 September 8am to 10am \n\nThursday, 19 September 8am to 9.30am \n\nFriday, 20 September 8am to 9.30am \n\nVery happy to discuss further if needed. \n\nKind regards \n\n| Assistant Director  \n\nDefending Democracy Unit | Electoral Integrity and Media Branch \n\nAustralian Electoral Commission \n\nPhone: \n\n | DDU Group Line: \n\n | Protected email: \n\nDISCLAIMER: \n\nIf you have received this transmission in error please notify us immediately by return email and delete \nall copies.

As emphasised in our recent direct engagement with\nthe Australian Electoral Commission, including members of the Electoral Integrity Taskforce,\nwe continue to invest in our Trust & Safety function, maintain our fact-checking infrastructure,\nincluding in Australia, and treat Federal elections with the seriousness they warrant, noting\nmany of the global concerns you raise.\n\nAs part of this ongoing work, in 2024 we updated our Civic and Election Integrity policies to\nprovide greater clarity around protections for election workers, or observers, who might face\nintimidation or harassment in the course of these critical events. We also continue to refine\nour AI-Generated Content (AIGC) policies to respond to emerging trends and threats. These\npolicies now require users to label AIGC content, using in-app features, and we also apply\nauto-labelling ourselves. We recognise that even when appropriately labelled, AIGC and edited\nmedia may still be harmful. We do not allow content that shares or shows fake authoritative\nsources or crisis events, or falsely shows public figures in certain contexts including being\nbullied, making an endorsement, or being endorsed. In these instances, we will remove the\nviolative content through proactive moderation, user reports, and reports as escalated by the\nAEC.\n\nNoting the global threat landscape, including around elections, in 2024 we also expanded our\nstate-affiliated media policies to further address state-affiliated media accounts that attempt\nto reach communities outside their home country on current global events and affairs. When\n\n\n--- Page 5 ---\n\nwe  identify  these  accounts,  they  will  become  ineligible  for  recommendation,  which  means \ntheir  content  won't  appear  in  the  For  You  feed  -  the  primary  way  TikTok  users  discover \ncontent. In addition, if these accounts advertise on our platform, they will not be allowed to \n\nadvertise  outside  of  the  country  with  which  they  are  primarily  affiliated.  Importantly,  in \nrelation to Covert Influence Operations, in 2024, we also introduced monthly public reporting, \nwhich we publish on our Transparency Centre.1 These reports disclose the detection source, \nthe  target  location(s)  of  such  operations,  the  number  of  accounts  in  a  network,  and  the \nnumber of followers those accounts might have had. We leverage our global team's expertise \n\nand insights in relation to any potential threats in Australia and, where we detect these, we \ndisclose them.  \n\nFor  the  upcoming  federal  election  in  Australia,  TikTok  has  established  a  dedicated  core \nworking group to assess and respond to reports we receive from the AEC, ensure moderation \n\nsystems  are  up-to-date,  and  adapt  to  unfolding  events  as  they  might  emerge  during  the \nelectoral period (including content related trends, whether concerning AICG or other types of \ncontent).  \n\nWe have taken specific actions to support the safety and integrity of the 2025 Federal Election, \n\nincluding:  \n\n1.  Upholding our prohibition on paid political advertising on-platform. This includes both \ntraditional  paid  advertisements  and  creators  receiving  compensation  to  support  or \noppose a candidate. \n\n2.  Maintaining an active TikTok reporting portal access for the AEC to report content of \n\nconcern.  \n\n3.  Providing re-direction, in-app, to authoritative election-related information for content \nconcerning  the  federal  election,  including  linking  to  the  AEC's  website  and  TikTok \naccount. \n\n4.  Conducting  impersonation  sweeps  for  accounts  that  are  verified  as  belonging  to \nAustralian political candidates, including existing elected Members and Senators, with \nappropriate enforcement action taken as a result.  \n\n5.  Issuing policy guidance specific to the election for our moderation system, including \n\nguidance that covers AIGC.  \n\n6.  Establishing a pathway for communication with other government agencies, including \nas it concerns the safety of Members of Parliament, to enable a timely response to \nissues that may arise in the Australian community during the electoral period.  \n\n1 Available at https://www.tiktok.com/transparency/en/covert-influence-operations.  \n\n2\n\n\n--- Page 6 ---\n\ncd TikTok\n\nWe are happy to clarify any of these matters via further discussion with the AEC, and we look\nforward to working alongside the AEC to ensure a safe 2025 Federal Election on TikTok.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nMemector of Public Policy |\n\nTikTok Australia\n\n\n--- Page 7 ---\n\nMonday, 17 February 2025 9:16 AM\n\n; Defending Democracy Unit\n\nMeeting reminder and advance notice of questions during EIAT Chair's brief \n[SEC=OFFICIAL]\n\nFrom:\nSent:\nTo:\nCc:\nSubject:\n\nCategories:\n\nGood morning\n\nAhead of our mee(cid:415)ng today at 1pm , I just wanted to give you the heads up about a couple of ques(cid:415)ons the EIAT TF \nChair, Ma(cid:425) Haigh, will ask you over the course of the update from the AEC/EIAT.  \n\n  What are some of the posi(cid:415)ve ways TikTok has been used during an elec(cid:415)on? (For example, community \neduca(cid:415)on campaigns, encouraging people to enrol and to vote. We note some reputable sources such as \nthe ABC have posted ‘How To Vote’ videos.) \n\n  Does the TikTok algorithm give priority to authorita(cid:415)ve sources of informa(cid:415)on about an elec(cid:415)on? For \n\nexample, AEC, ABC and other authorita(cid:415)ve sources of informa(cid:415)on. \n\n  Does TikTok have any elec(cid:415)on speciﬁc ﬁlters (no(cid:415)ng Snap has something, but this may work diﬀerently on \n\nTikTok) \n\n  Have referral pathways changed since the 2023 referendum? \n  Have there been any changes to TikTok’s processes or referral pathways for legal referrals? \n  We’re aware that the use of AI to enable the spread of mis and disinforma(cid:415)on remains an existen(cid:415)al \nchallenge for everyone in the online environment, including TikTok. Given reports of AI enabled \nmisinforma(cid:415)on on TikTok (Network of TikTok accounts using AI to spread poli(cid:415)cal misinforma(cid:415)on, report \nﬁnds | Mashable , TikTok Content Farms Use AI Voiceovers to Mass-Produce Poli(cid:415)cal Misinforma(cid:415)on - \nNewsGuard) during last year’s elec(cid:415)ons: \n\no  What did TikTok learn from this and has this ben the catalyst for any changes? \no  What guardrails will TikTok have in place for the Australian elec(cid:415)on? \n\nI trust most of these will be pre(cid:425)y straight forward but wanted to give you a bit of advance no(cid:415)ce.

Alternatively, the week \nstarting 8 October would be easier again for us.  \n\nDoes your team have availability then?  \n\nRegards, \n\nOn Mon, Sep 9, 2024 at 8:53 AM \n\n wrote: \n\nGood morning \n\nWe hope this email finds you well. \n\nAs you would be aware, the AEC is preparing for the next federal election (FE24/25); while the date is yet \nto be determined by government, it could be called at any time with the latest date for it to be held \nbeing in May 2025. We would therefore like to arrange a meeting with you (and/or appropriate \nrepresentatives as you see fit) in preparation. \n\nGiven you will likely be quite busy in the lead up to the US Presidential election on 5 November, we \nwould like to propose a meeting this month. \n\nAt this meeting we would be interested in covering: \n\n an update from the AEC on Australia’s electoral integrity environment \n\n an update from TikTok about your observations and lessons learned from recent \nelections around the globe and how these experiences are shaping your work \n\n2\n\ns 47Fs 47Fs 47Es 47Es 47Fs 47Fs 47Fs 47Fs47F\n\n\n--- Page 15 ---\n\n how TikTok are responding to electoral integrity risks, with a particular focus on how \nwe can ensure the Australian public has access to timely and accurate information \nabout the electoral process \n\n confirming the options and/or escalation pathways for the EIAT and the AEC to flag \npotential issues with TikTok in relation to Australian federal electoral events \n\n discuss the (FE24/25) version of the Online Platform Scenarios, which, although \nsimilar to the Referendum scenarios, has had some updates \n\nGrateful if you could please advise which (if any) of the following dates would be suitable for a \nSeptember meeting.  \n\nWe would be aiming for a one-hour window within the following times. \n\nTuesday, 17 September 8am to 9.30am \n\nWednesday, 18 September 8am to 10am \n\nThursday, 19 September 8am to 9.30am \n\nFriday, 20 September 8am to 9.30am \n\nVery happy to discuss further if needed. \n\nKind regards, \n\n| Assistant Director  \n\nDefending Democracy Unit | Electoral Integrity and Media Branch \n\nAustralian Electoral Commission \n\n |\n\n | Protected email: \n\nMy hours are 8am to 4pm, Monday to Friday \n\nDISCLAIMER: \n\nIf you have received this transmission in error please notify us immediately by return email and delete all \ncopies.

Check multiple sources of information, \nparticularly if you’re not sure of the information's authenticity. For information about the Australian \nfederal election - including voting processes and your rights and obligations under Australian law - go to \nthe AEC.  \n\n  Tips to ‘stop and consider’  \n \n\nLearn about the voting process  \n\nWays to vote \nAustralia has some of the best voting options in the world.  \n\nIf you can vote on election day, then that is what you should do. If you can’t make it on election day you \ncan vote during the two-week early voting period – either in-person or via post. Plan your vote according \nto your circumstances. \n\n  Election day: in your local area or at dedicated interstate voting centres.  \n\n  Pre-polling: in-person at an early voting centre - anywhere around Australia or at an overseas \n\nvoting centre \n\n  Mobile voting: via a mobile voting team visiting remote communities, residential care facilities, \n\nsome hospitals and a range of other locations of need.    \n\n  Postal voting: if you can't make it to a voting centre \n\nHead here for more information and options. \n\nPreferential voting \nVoting in the federal election is compulsory for all Australian citizens aged 18+ on the electoral roll. Know \nhow the Australian preferential voting system works before you head to a voting centre \n\nWhere to vote \nVoting locations will be available in the week before the voting period starts.  \n\n-  Find your federal electoral division \n-  Find my nearest voting centre \n\n2\n\n\n--- Page 19 ---\n\n[The second link here will change substantially after the election has been announced] \n\nHappy to discuss if there are any questions or points of clarity that I can assist with. \n\nRegards, \n\nDirector of Public Policy, Australia and New Zealand \n\nTo help p otect y ou  p v acy  M c osoft Off ce p ev ented au omat c download of th s pictu e f om the Inte net\n\n3\n\ns 47Fs 47F\n\n\n--- Page 20 ---\n\nFrom:\nSent:\nTo:\nCc:\nSubject:\n\nGood a(cid:332)ernoon,\n\nEIAT\nThursday, 16 January 2025 4:55 PM\n\nDefending Democracy Unit; EIAT; \n\nRequest for meeting with EIAT representatives [SEC=OFFICIAL]\n\nI hope this email ﬁnds you well and you enjoyed your Christmas break. \n\nIn prepara(cid:415)on for the next federal elec(cid:415)on, the Electoral Integrity Assurance Taskforce (EIAT) are \narranging mee(cid:415)ngs with each of the online pla(cid:414)orms.
