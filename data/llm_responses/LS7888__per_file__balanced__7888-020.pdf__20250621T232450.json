            "text": "This document, an \"ESTIMATES BRIEF - Hot Issue\" dated 15 February 2019, provides updated Indigenous enrolment rate estimates for the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC).\n\n**Summary of Document:**\nThe brief announces that the AEC has prepared new Indigenous enrolment rate estimates based on a \"more robust\" and \"more recent and accurate\" methodology, utilizing \"self-identified Indigeneity data by the Department of Human Services\" (Centrelink data) and population data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics. This new approach superseded previous estimates of 58%. Key findings presented include a national Indigenous enrolment rate of 76.4% as at 30 June 2018. Over the 12 months leading to 30 June 2018, the estimated number of enrolled Indigenous Australians increased by 5.1% to 383,078, while non-enrolled individuals fell by 4% to 118,581. The document notes that Indigenous enrolment has grown at a faster pace than the overall electoral roll and provides state-by-state enrolment rates and improvement percentages. It states this improved methodology will be used annually to inform future strategies for increasing Indigenous electoral participation.\n\n**Relevance to FOI Request LS7888:**\nThis document is highly relevant to FOI request LS7888 as it directly addresses the AEC's \"new methodology for its Indigenous Electoral Participation Program (IEPP).\"\n*   **Design and Implementation of New Methodology:** It explicitly confirms the core of the new methodology, detailing its reliance on direct matching with Department of Human Services (Centrelink) Indigeneity data and ABS population data, which replaced less reliable prior methods. It states this \"improved methodology\" will be used going forward.\n*   **Catalysts:** The document highlights the catalyst for the change was the need for \"more robust\" and \"more recent and accurate data\" to improve upon previous, less reliable estimates.\n*   **Tracking and Outcomes:** It provides precise data on the \"outcomes\" and \"tracking\" enabled by the new methodology, including the estimated national Indigenous enrolment rate (76.4% as at June 2018), the number of enrolled and non-enrolled Indigenous individuals, and their changes over time. This directly supports the FOI's finding of a \"significant upward trend\" in enrolment rates revealed by the new method.\n*   **Indigenous Involvement and Cost/Staff:** Consistent with the FOI overview, this specific document provides no information regarding Indigenous involvement in the design process or the final cost and exact staffing for the project."

  "prompt": "Considering this document as part of an FOI request, summarize the document and its relevance to the FOI request in markdown format. FYI the overview of the FOI request is: FOI request LS7888 sought documents (2018-2019) on the Australian Electoral Commission's (AEC) new methodology for its Indigenous Electoral Participation Program (IEPP), specifically its design, testing, and implementation, including catalysts, tracking, outcomes, Indigenous involvement, and cost/staff. The released documents, primarily emails and internal papers, reveal that the core of the new methodology is the direct matching of electoral roll data with Centrelink Indigeneity data, a more robust approach initiated internally to improve accuracy, replacing less reliable prior regression models. This method helped identify over 107,000 unenrolled Indigenous individuals, contributing to enrolment stimulation events (e.g., 2,646 new enrolments). The documents confirm estimated national Indigenous enrolment rates of 76.4% (June 2018) and 76.6% (June 2019), demonstrating a significant upward trend from previous estimates, though they provide limited information on Indigenous involvement in the design process or the final cost and exact staffing for the project.\n\nDocument Text:\n\nESTIMATES BRIEF - Hot Issue \nAdditional Estimates – February 2019 \n\nINDIGENOUS ENROLMENT RATE ESTIMATES \n\nSubject/Issue \n\nThe Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) has prepared Indigenous enrolment \nrate estimates that show an overall increase on previous estimates. \n\nKey points \n\n AEC Indigenous enrolment rate estimates, show an overall increase on\n\nprevious published data and shows that the Indigenous enrolment rate has\ngrown at a faster pace than that of the Roll as a whole.\n\n As at 30 June 2018 the AEC estimates that the national Indigenous enrolment\n\nwas 76.4 per cent.\n\n This new estimate based on more robust data reveals that the estimated\n\nnumber of Indigenous Australians of voting age, who are enrolled continues\nto rise.\n\n In the 12 months from 30 June 2017 to 30 June 2018 the AEC estimates there\n\nhas been:\n\no a 5.1 per cent increase in the estimated number of enrolled Indigenous\nAustralians as a proportion of the estimated Indigenous population,\nrising from 364,631 to 383,078; and\n\no a corresponding 4 per cent fall in the estimated number of non-enrolled\n\nIndigenous Australians from 123,517 to 118,581.\n\n In the same 12 month period the estimated Indigenous voting age population\nonly increased by 2.8 per cent (13,511 electors) from 488,148 to 501,659.\n\n Any gap between non-Indigenous and Indigenous enrolment rates is\n\ndisappointing, however it is encouraging to see that Indigenous enrolment\nrates have improved considerably since the last time estimates were prepared.\n\n This new estimates will further inform the strategies that the AEC is\n\ndelivering to further increase electoral participation by Aboriginal and Torres\nStrait Islander people.\n\nSB19-000015 \n\n1 \n\nLS7888 Released Document No. 20\fBackground  \n\nIndigenous enrolment rate estimates \n  Previous Indigenous enrolment rate estimates of 58 per cent were based on the best \n\ninformation we had at the time. \n\n  These new figures are based on more recent and accurate data. Specifically, the AEC has \n\nbeen provided with self-identified Indigeneity data by the Department of Human Services, \nand with population data by the Australian Bureau of Statistics. \n\n  The AEC will be using this improved methodology from here on, and we’ll be updating \n\nthe data every year as part of our annual roll-integrity review. \n \nIndigenous enrolment rate has grown at a faster pace than that of the Roll as a whole. \n  The table below shows the estimated Indigenous enrolment rates at 30 June 2017 and \n\n30 June 2018 by state and territory.
