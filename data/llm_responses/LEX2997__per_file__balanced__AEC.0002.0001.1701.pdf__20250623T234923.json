            "text": "### Document Summary\n\nThis document, an internal email thread from April 13, 2021, details discussions among key Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) personnel regarding a media inquiry from *The Courier-Mail* concerning Andrew Laming MP. The email exchange involves Louise Parrott (Principal Government Lawyer), Tom Rogers, Jeff Pope, and the AEC media team and Executive Leadership Team. The primary focus is the finalisation and legal approval of a proposed response to the media. The legal team confirms their comfort with the response, and the media team suggests enhancing it by including a link to the AEC's \"Backgrounder on auth requirements,\" which outlines potential penalties, a resource previously provided to other journalists. The email is marked \"OFFICIAL:Sensitive.\"\n\n### Relevance to FOI Request\n\nThis document is highly relevant to the FOI request for the following reasons:\n\n*   **Confirms Active Investigation and Media Engagement:** It demonstrates that as of April 13, 2021, the AEC's investigation into Andrew Laming was active and attracting media attention, prompting the AEC to formulate official responses. This aligns with the FOI request's overview, which states the inquiry was triggered by public complaints and media reports.\n*   **Illustrates AEC's Communication Strategy:** The email exchange reveals the AEC's coordinated approach to managing public inquiries related to the investigation, involving legal review and strategic communication advice (e.g., linking to backgrounders on authorisation laws and penalties).\n*   **Underscores Focus on Authorisation Compliance:** The discussion about providing information on \"auth requirements\" and \"potential penalties\" directly relates to the core subject of the FOI request: Laming's compliance with federal electoral authorisation laws, particularly concerning social media content.\n*   **Indicates Sensitivity of the Matter:** The \"OFFICIAL:Sensitive\" classification highlights the sensitive nature of the ongoing investigation and the AEC's careful handling of public communications surrounding it."

  "prompt": "Considering this document as part of an FOI request, summarize the document and its relevance to the FOI request in markdown format. Provide only the markdown formatted summary text. Do not include any conversational filler or preamble.To aid you, the overview of the FOI request is: [REQUEST OVERVIEW START] The FOI request disclosed documents detailing the Australian Electoral Commission's (AEC) investigation into Andrew Laming MP's Facebook pages for compliance with federal electoral authorisation laws. This inquiry was triggered by public complaints and media reports, notably from *The Guardian*, alleging Laming used numerous pages (e.g., \"Redland Bay Bulletin,\" \"Redlands Institute\") disguised as community or news groups to promote political content and attack opponents without mandatory disclosures. The AEC confirmed an active investigation, noting 2018 Electoral Act amendments broadened social media authorisation, and issued formal notices to Laming for detailed information and to third parties (like Facebook) for data, with Facebook confirming its cooperation. Findings revealed some pages were removed or updated with authorisation, while others remained active and unauthorised.\n [REQUEST OVERVIEW END] \n\n--- MAIN DOCUMENT TEXT START ---\n\n\n\n--- Page 1 ---\n\nAEC.0002.0001.1701\n\nFrom:                                 Louise ParrottSent:                                  Tue, 13 Apr 2021 12:27:40 +1000To:                                      Tom Rogers;media;Jeff Pope;Executive Leadership TeamCc:                                      David Lang;Evan Ekin-SmythSubject:                             RE: Courier-Mail: Laming [SEC=OFFICIAL:Sensitive]Thanks all.
