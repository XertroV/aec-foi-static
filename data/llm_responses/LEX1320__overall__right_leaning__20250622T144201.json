            "text": "As a right-leaning analyst, a review of these FOI documents concerning the Australian Electoral Commission's (AEC) administration for the 2016 Federal Election reveals several points of alignment and deviation from core conservative principles:\n\n**Economic Efficiency and Fiscal Responsibility:**\nThe system demonstrates a mixed approach. The requirement for a **nomination deposit** ($1,000 for House of Representatives, $2,000 for Senate) that is **forfeited if a candidate fails to secure at least four percent of the primary vote** aligns with principles of economic efficiency and fiscal responsibility. This mechanism discourages frivolous candidacies, ensuring that only serious contenders enter the race and contributing a minor offset to administrative costs. It acts as a market signal for political viability.\n\nHowever, the policy of **public election funding** for candidates and Senate groups who receive four percent or more of the formal first preference votes represents a significant deviation from fiscal conservatism. This direct allocation of taxpayer funds to political campaigns, while potentially intended to level the playing field, can be viewed as an inefficient use of public money and a form of government subsidy that distorts the free market of political ideas. From a fiscally conservative standpoint, campaign funding should primarily derive from private sources, minimizing the burden on taxpayers and avoiding the potential for state-supported political enterprises. The extensive administrative processes outlined in the handbooks, from detailed nomination forms to complex counting procedures and financial disclosure oversight, also point to a substantial **government administrative overhead**, which, while necessary for a fair election, still represents a considerable cost to the taxpayer.\n\n**Individual Liberty:**\nThe documents largely uphold individual liberty in the electoral process. The clear pathways for individuals to nominate for election, whether endorsed by a political party or as an independent (requiring 100 elector signatures, or one for incumbent independents), reflect a commitment to the **right to participate in self-governance**. The public disclosure of nomination forms and financial returns (with limited exceptions for silent electors and sensitive contact details) promotes **transparency and accountability**, which are vital for an informed electorate and the protection of individual freedom from opaque political dealings. However, the requirement for a significant number of signatures for non-party candidates, coupled with the deposit, could be seen as a minor barrier to entry, potentially limiting broader participation for truly independent individuals without significant organizational backing.\n\n**National Security:**\nThe stringent **disqualification criteria outlined in Section 44 of the Constitution**, particularly concerning \"acknowledgment of allegiance...to a foreign power,\" are a strong alignment with national security principles. The AEC's consistent re-iteration of this (citing cases like *Sykes v. Cleary* and *Sue v. Hill*) underscores the importance of ensuring that elected representatives' loyalty is solely to the Commonwealth, free from foreign influence or divided loyalties. This is a critical safeguard for national sovereignty and integrity of government.\n\n**Limited Government:**\nThe AEC's explicitly defined role as an **independent statutory authority focused on administering elections and maintaining the electoral roll**, rather than regulating the *content* of political messages (e.g., truth in advertising), generally aligns with the principle of limited government. This hands-off approach to political speech ensures a robust marketplace of ideas, free from government censorship or subjective judgment on \"truth.\" The various electoral offenses, while prescriptive, are aimed at safeguarding the integrity and fairness of the process itself (e.g., preventing bribery, fraudulent voting, or undue interference at polling places), which are necessary functions to ensure legitimate governance within a limited framework. However, the sheer volume and granularity of regulations governing every step of the election process, from the precise format of nomination forms and payment methods to detailed rules for scrutineers and advertising, illustrate the **extensive regulatory burden** imposed by the state, which continuously tests the boundaries of limited government, even when pursuing a legitimate aim like fair elections. The constant updates and extensive handbooks signify a large, active bureaucracy, a perpetual point of scrutiny for proponents of smaller government."

If so, you will \nneed a clear understanding of the legislative requirements you must meet, and of \nyour role and responsibilities under the law.\n\nRemember, you and your supporters can play a significant role in helping to ensure, \nas far as possible, that every vote cast in an election counts.\n\nThe Candidates Handbook \n\nThis handbook is published by the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC), the \nCommonwealth agency which maintains the electoral roll and conducts federal \nelections, by-elections and referendums. The handbook covers the stages for the \nelectoral process relevant to candidates. \n\nEach chapter in the handbook lists the relevant parts of the Commonwealth \nElectoral Act 1918 (the Act), detailing how the electoral law applies to candidates \nand those assisting them.\n\nThe AEC suggests that you consult the Commonwealth of Australia Constitution \nAct (the Constitution), the Act and other legislation, including the Referendum \n(Machinery Provisions) Act 1984 referred to for the exact provisions.\n\nCandidates must satisfy themselves about their own legal position and, if necessary, \nrefer to the exact provisions of the Constitution and the Act, and consult their own \nlawyers.\n\nYou can access this handbook, the Constitution and the Act via the AEC website.\n\nOffences relating to the election, whether they occur before or during the election, \nare listed in Appendix 1. Some electoral offences apply at all times, while others \napply to specific periods.\n\nThe AEC can assist you by providing information of a general nature about the \nnomination process and campaign activity. However, we cannot provide you with \nformal or informal legal advice.\n\nCandidates Handbook  Federal elections  |  By-elections  Page 4\n\n\n--- Page 7 ---\n\nAbbreviations and acronyms have been kept to a minimum. However, five are used \nthroughout this handbook:\n\n ■ AEC – Australian Electoral Commission\n\n ■ AEO – Australian Electoral Officer\n\n ■ ARO – Assistant Returning Officer\n\n ■ DRO – Divisional Returning Officer\n\n ■ the Act – Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918.\n\nThe words ‘voter’ and ‘elector’ are used interchangeably.\n\nAt the end of this handbook you will find a glossary which explains terms that may be \nunfamiliar to you.\n\nHow this handbook can help you \n\nThe handbook explains the steps you will need to take to qualify as a candidate and \nto comply with the law before, during and after an election.\n\nAt the end of this introductory section you will find a checklist (see page 8) that \ntakes you through important details you will need to know and the activities you will \nneed to undertake as a candidate, and indicates where in the handbook you can \nfind more information.\n\nAgain, the handbook is intended to assist candidates standing for election by \nexplaining relevant processes and procedures. It is not, however, a substitute for \nthe law.\n\nPublic inspection \n\nYou need to be aware that many of the documents you submit in relation to \nyour candidacy will be made available for public inspection. These include your \nnomination form and your financial disclosure return. Exceptions may apply in \ncertain circumstances.\n\nCandidates Handbook  Federal elections  |  By-elections  Page 5\n\n\n--- Page 8 ---\n\nAEC website \n\nBecause information can change during the life of a publication, the AEC website is \nthe best source of up-to-date information.\n\nAll forms and publications referred to in this handbook are available from the \nwebsite or by contacting the AEC on 13 23 26.\n\nAEC National, State, Territory and Division Office contact details\n\nYou will find office contact details on the AEC website.\n\nFeedback welcome\n\nThe AEC welcomes your views on the usefulness of the Candidates Handbook and \nany specific information provided in these pages. We invite you to provide feedback \nvia the AEC website.\n\nThe AEC also publishes Electoral Backgrounders on specific aspects \nof electoral law. Copies of these AEC publications can be accessed by \nphoning 13 23 26 or by visiting the AEC website.\n\nCandidates Handbook  Federal elections  |  By-elections  Page 6\n\n\n--- Page 9 ---\n\nTiming of the election\n\nFederal elections \n\nThe constitutional and legislative frameworks that govern Australian federal \nelections determine both the election timetable and electoral processes.\n\nBoth Houses of Parliament have separate provisions reflecting their different \nconstitutional roles. A House of Representatives term expires three years from \nits first official meeting, but can be dissolved earlier. Once the term expires or is \ndissolved, the Governor-General will issue the writs for an election.\n\nThe Senate is a continuing body with senators for each state elected for a six-year \nterm. A rotation system ensures that half the Senate is retired or up for election \nevery three years. Two senators represent the Australian Capital Territory and two \nsenators represent the Northern Territory. These senators are elected concurrently \nwith the members of the House of Representatives. The duration of their term of \noffice also coincides with the members of the House of Representatives.\n\nUsually the House of Representatives and the half Senate elections are held \nat the same time. However, the Governor-General may dissolve both Houses \nsimultaneously upon certain conditions having been met under section 57 of the \nConstitution, resulting in a general election for the House of Representatives and all \nof the Senate. This is known as a double dissolution.\n\nThe key dates in the election timetable are available on the AEC website.\n\nBy-elections \n\nWhenever a vacancy occurs in the House of Representatives because of the death, \nresignation, absence without leave, expulsion, disqualification or ineligibility of a \nmember, a writ may be issued for the election of a new member. A writ may also be \nissued when the Court of Disputed Returns declares an election void.\n\nThe guiding principle in fixing the date of a by-election has always been to hold the \nelection as early as possible so that the electors are not left without representation \nany longer than is necessary.\n\nCandidates Handbook  Federal elections  |  By-elections  Page 7\n\n\n--- Page 10 ---\n\nChecklist\n\nI am aware of key dates in the election period following the \nissue of the writs\n\nI have familiarised myself with the law relating to  \nelectoral offences\n\nSection\n\nPage\n\nThe writ\n\n13\n\nAppendix 1\n\n66\n\nI have confirmed that I am qualified to nominate\n\nNominations\n\n15\n\nI have obtained the endorsement of a registered political \nparty; or I have obtained the signatures of eligible electors \n(for candidates who are not endorsed by a registered \npolitical party only); or I am an incumbent independent and \nhave obtained the signatures of eligible electors\n\nNominations\n\n21\n\nI have appointed an agent (optional)\n\nNominations\n\n29, 45\n\nI have provided all my personal information required on the \nnomination form\n\nNominations\n\n23\n\nI have requested on the nomination form that the word \n‘Independent’ be printed on the ballot paper next to my \nname (this is optional for ungrouped Senate candidates \nwho are not endorsed by a registered political party)\n\nNominations\n\n25\n\nI have lodged my nomination form by the required deadline\n\nNominations\n\n18\n\nI have notified my intention to lodge a group voting ticket or \nan individual voting ticket (for Senate candidates only and \nif applicable)\n\nBallot \npapers\n\n38\n\nI have lodged my nomination deposit by the required \ndeadline\n\nNominations\n\n27\n\nI am aware of my responsibilities with regard to electoral \nadvertising, particularly in relation to How to Vote Cards\n\nVoting\n\nI have, or my agent has, lodged my financial disclosure \nreturn by the due date (within 15 weeks after election day)\n\nElection \nfunding & \nfinancial \ndisclosure\n\n42\n\n45\n\nI have appointed scrutineers (optional) by completing and \nsigning the form\n\nScrutineers\n\n53\n\nI am aware of the circumstances and procedures that may \nlead to a recount of votes in an election\n\n60\n\nRecounts \n& disputed \nreturns\n\nCandidates Handbook  Federal elections  |  By-elections  Page 8\n\n\n--- Page 11 ---\n\n1. The writ\n\n ■ Part VIII, ‘Enrolment’\n\n ■ Part XIII, ‘Writs for elections’\n\n ■ Part XIX, ‘The return of the writs’\n\nThe issue of a writ triggers the election process and provides the opportunity for you \nto nominate as a candidate. The writ is the legal document necessary for the official \ntimetable and process for the election to begin.\n\nIssue of the writ\nThe Constitution, s.12 and s.32\nThe Act, s.151 and s.152\n\nThe issuing of the writs triggers the election process. The writs are deemed to be \nissued at 6pm on the day they are issued.\n\nThe writs must be issued within 10 days from the expiry of the House of \nRepresentatives or from the proclamation of a dissolution of the House of \nRepresentatives. If the Senate is dissolved, the writs must be issued within 10 days \nof dissolution.\n\nHouse of Representatives \nThe Constitution, s.32 and s.33\nThe Act, s.154\n\nThe Governor-General issues the writs for a general election of members of the \nHouse of Representatives. They are addressed to the Electoral Commissioner, who \nadvises each Divisional Returning Officer (DRO) of the dates specified in the writs \nand directs them to make election arrangements.\n\nCandidates Handbook  Federal elections  |  By-elections  Page 9\n\n\n--- Page 12 ---\n\nEight writs are issued for each general election of the House of Representatives: one \nin each state and one each for the Australian Capital Territory and Northern Territory.\n\nSenate\nThe Constitution, s.12\nThe Act, s.151 and s.153\n\nThe writ for the election of senators for a state is issued by the governor of the state \nand is addressed to the Australian Electoral Officer (AEO) for that particular state. \nThe writ for the election of senators for a territory is issued by the Governor-General \nand is addressed to the AEO for that particular territory.\n\nDates fixed in the writ\nThe Act, s.152 and s.154\n\nThe writ specifies the key dates of an election in accordance with the legislated \nelection timetable. These dates specify the timing for the close of the rolls, the close \nof nominations, the election day and the return of the writ.\n\nThe AEC advertises these dates within major newspapers circulating in each state \nand territory and on the AEC website. An indicative election timetable is shown on \npage 13.\n\nClose of rolls \nThe Act, s.102 and s.155\n\nThe rolls close at 8pm on the seventh day after the date of the issue of the writ.\n\nClose of nominations \nThe Act, s.156\n\nThe date for the close of nominations is set out in the writ. It must be at least \n10 days, but not more than 27 days, after the date of issue of the writ. You can \nnominate as a candidate during AEC business hours any time after the writ is issued \nup to 12 noon on the day nominations close. The Act strictly prescribes where you \nmust submit your nomination form and deposit. Nominations cannot be accepted \nunder any circumstances if those requirements are not met. \n\nCandidates Handbook  Federal elections  |  By-elections  Page 10\n\n\n--- Page 13 ---\n\nDeclaration of nominations \nThe Act, s.175 and s.176 \n\nNominations are publicly declared 24 hours after they close.

After all votes have \nbeen counted the DRO prepares a statement setting out the result of the election. \nThis statement is sent to the Electoral Commissioner.\n\nAfter receiving a statement of results from every DRO, the Electoral Commissioner \nendorses the name of each candidate elected for each electoral division in the \nstate or territory on a certificate and attaches it to the relevant writ. The Electoral \nCommissioner then returns the writs to the Governor-General or to the Speaker in \nthe case of a by-election.\n\nIn a Senate election the AEO, as soon as convenient after the election result has \nbeen determined, publicly declares the result of the election and the names of the \ncandidates elected.

Any person who –\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nis under any acknowledgment of allegiance, obedience, or adherence to a \nforeign power, or is a subject or a citizen or entitled to the rights or privileges \nof a subject or a citizen of a foreign power; or\n\nis attainted of treason, or has been convicted and is under sentence, or \nsubject to be sentenced, for any offence punishable under the law of the \nCommonwealth or of a State by imprisonment for one year or longer; or\n\n(iii)  is an undischarged bankrupt or insolvent; or\n\nCandidates Handbook  Federal elections  |  By-elections  Page 15\n\n\n--- Page 18 ---\n\n(iv)  holds any office of profit under the Crown, or any pension payable during the \npleasure of the Crown out of any of the revenues of the Commonwealth; or\n\n(v)  has any direct or indirect pecuniary interest in any agreement with the Public \nService of the Commonwealth otherwise than as a member and in common \nwith the other members of an incorporated company consisting of more than \ntwenty-five persons;  \nshall be incapable of being chosen or of sitting as a senator or a member of \nthe House of Representatives.\n\nBut subsection (iv) does not apply to the office of any of the Queen’s Ministers of \nState for the Commonwealth, or of any of the Queen’s Ministers for a State, or to the \nreceipt of pay, half-pay, or a pension, by any person as an officer or member of the \nQueen’s navy or army, or to the receipt of pay as an officer or member of the naval \nor military forces of the Commonwealth by any person whose services are not wholly \nemployed by the Commonwealth.\n\nThe Act, s.36\n\nNo candidate may be appointed as an electoral officer of any description, either \nas a permanent officer or as a polling official. If an electoral officer becomes a \ncandidate, they must vacate the office.\n\nFor more information see the Electoral Backgrounder on Constitutional \nDisqualifications and Intending Candidates, which is available on the AEC \nwebsite or from AEC national and state offices.\n\n‘Office of profit’ disqualification\n\nIn its November 1992 decision in the case of Sykes v. Cleary, the High Court voided \nthe election of Mr Phil Cleary as member of the House of Representatives for the \nDivision of Wills. Mr Cleary was disqualified from being chosen as a member under \nsection 44(iv) of the Constitution on the grounds that, as a Victorian state school \nteacher on leave without pay, he held an ‘office of profit’ under the Crown. This case \nhas been approved in subsequent High Court applications.\n\nIf you are a Commonwealth, state or territory public servant and wish to nominate \nfor election to the Commonwealth Parliament, you should resign before nomination \nin order to comply with the Constitution. Conditions of re-entry to the various public \nservices by unsuccessful candidates are matters for the relevant public service \nauthority.\n\nCandidates Handbook  Federal elections  |  By-elections  Page 16\n\n\n--- Page 19 ---\n\nCommonwealth public servants who resign to contest an election and who are \nunsuccessful may apply for re-appointment or re-engagement under section 32 \nof the Public Service Act 1999. A former officer or former temporary employee is \nrequired to be re-appointed or re-engaged subject to certain conditions.\n\nMost states and territories have comparable statutory or administrative provisions. \nThe position of local government employees is not clear and it might be that such \npersons are vulnerable to the office of profit disqualification. Section 327(3) of the \nAct provides some protection for local government employees who become, are, or \nhave been candidates. If you are a local government employee you should check \nwith the relevant authorities before resigning or nominating.\n\nThe Constitutional disqualification on the ground of ‘office of profit’ applies to \npermanent members of the Australian Defence Force (ADF). If you are a member \nof the ADF you should consult the relevant Defence authority on conditions of \nresignation and re-entry.\n\n‘Foreign allegiance’ disqualification\n\nIn the Sykes v. Cleary decision the High Court also commented on the ‘foreign \nallegiance’ disqualification in section 44(i) of the Constitution. The majority view of \nthe Court was that naturalised Australian citizens who also have foreign citizenship \nand are standing as candidates should take ‘reasonable steps to renounce foreign \nnationality’. The steps to take for renunciation may depend upon foreign law. If \nyou have foreign citizenship you should check with the relevant embassy or high \ncommission about the procedures for renouncing it.\n\nIn the case of Sue v. Hill in June 1999 the High Court decided that Ms Heather \nHill was not duly elected as a senator for Queensland at the 1998 federal election \nbecause she was disqualified under section 44(i) of the Constitution. Ms Hill was a \nBritish subject and an Australian citizen at the time of her nomination. The United \nKingdom is regarded as a ‘foreign power’ for the purposes of section 44(i).\n\nYou are required to sign a declaration on the nomination form that you are \nqualified under the Constitution and the laws of the Commonwealth to be \nelected to the Commonwealth Parliament.\n\nIf you have any doubts as to your qualifications under the Constitution, \nthe AEC recommends you seek your own legal advice.

In a House of Representatives only election, voters who \nreside in states of Australia will receive a green ballot paper only. Voters in the \nAustralian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory will receive both a House of \nRepresentatives ballot paper and a Senate ballot paper, which is white.\n\nCandidates should carefully consider the information contained in this fact sheet \nwhen developing how-to-vote cards (see page 35).\n\nSenate ballot papers are white. They have two parts: an upper section and a lower \nsection, separated by a thick black line. A row of boxes above the line relate to \nparties, incumbent independents and groups. If an elector marks a ‘1’ in a single \nbox above the line, then the elector’s preferences will be allocated in accordance \nwith the group voting ticket of the relevant party, independent or group.\n\nThe lower section contains boxes with the names of every candidate and their \nparties (if applicable) or the word ‘Independent’ (for some ungrouped candidates) \nprinted to the right of the boxes. If an elector chooses to vote below the line, that is, \nin the lower section, they must number every box by putting the number ‘1’ in the \nbox next to the candidate who is their first choice, the number ‘2’ in the box next to \ntheir second choice, and so on until every box is numbered.\n\nCandidates Handbook  Federal elections  |  By-elections  Page 34\n\n\n--- Page 37 ---\n\nHow to make your vote count fact sheet\n\nHow to make your vote count\n\nHouse of Representatives\n\nOn election day, you will receive two ballot papers: \na green one for the House of Representatives and a \nwhite one for the Senate.\n\nGreen ballot paper\n\nOn the green ballot paper, you need to put a ‘1’ \nin the box beside the candidate who is your first \nchoice, ‘2’ in the box beside your second choice  \nand so on, until you have numbered every box.\n\nYou must number every box for your vote to count.\n\nDon’t worry if you make a mistake.

Parties, however constituted, that are not registered with the AEC are \nnot entitled to have a party name printed next to their candidates’ names on the \nballot paper.\n\nThe request to have a registered party name or abbreviation printed on a ballot \npaper may be made on the nomination form.\n\nAlternatively, the registered officer of that party may make the request in writing to \nthe relevant AEO or DRO before the close of nominations.\n\nEndorsed House of Representatives candidates \n\nAn endorsed candidate of a registered political party may have either the registered \nname or the registered abbreviation of that political party printed next to their name \non the ballot paper.\n\nOnly one candidate can be endorsed by a registered political party for any \nHouse of Representatives division. If a party attempts to endorse more \nthan one candidate all nominations for that division will fail.\n\nEndorsed Senate candidates\n\nA group of endorsed Senate candidates of a registered political party who propose to \nregister a group voting ticket may have either the registered name or the registered \nabbreviation of that party printed next to their group voting square on the upper \nsection of the ballot paper, and next to each of their names on the lower section of \nthe ballot paper.\n\nA composite group of candidates endorsed by more than one registered political \nparty that proposes to register a group voting ticket may have a composite party \nname printed next to their group voting square on the upper section of the Senate \nballot paper.

Within 48 hours after the close of nominations, a Senate group may \nlodge a written statement setting out a preference order of all candidates in the \nelection with the AEO for the state or territory. This is referred to as a group voting \nticket.\n\nThe preference ordering must be a fully formal vote meaning that all candidates \nmust be numbered. In addition, the candidates in the group lodging the statement \nmust be ordered ahead of any other candidate.\n\nCandidates Handbook  Federal elections  |  By-elections  Page 38\n\n\n--- Page 41 ---\n\nThe preference statement or group voting ticket must be signed by:\n\n ■ the registered officer of the party, where all the members of the group have \n\nbeen endorsed by the same registered political party, or\n\n ■ the registered officers of all relevant parties, where the members of the group \n\nhave been endorsed by different registered political parties, or\n\n ■ the candidate whose name first appears in the group on the ballot paper, in a \n\ncase not covered by either of the above, or\n\n ■ a person authorised by all the members of the group to sign on behalf of the \n\ngroup.\n\nThe preference ordering may be specified in the form of a how-to-vote card. \n\nA group may lodge up to three group voting tickets, provided that the preference \norder shown places the candidates in the group lodging the statement ahead of any \nother candidate, and gives the same order of preference for the members of the \ngroup on each ticket.\n\nWhen a group lodges one or more group voting tickets, a square will be printed \nabove the line on the Senate ballot paper. Voters wishing to vote according to \nthe group voting ticket simply fill in that square with the number ‘1’ and their \npreferences will be allocated according to the group voting ticket during the scrutiny \nprocess.\n\nWhere two tickets are lodged, half of the votes are allocated to each of the \npreference orders.\n\nWhere three tickets are lodged, one-third of the votes are allocated to each of the \npreference orders.\n\nBooklets setting out copies of all group voting tickets that have been lodged in a \nstate or territory are available at every polling place on election day. Early voting \ncentres and interstate voting centres will also have copies of group voting tickets for \nall states and territories and they will be published on the AEC website.\n\nCandidates Handbook  Federal elections  |  By-elections  Page 39\n\n\n--- Page 42 ---\n\nIncumbent independent senator voting tickets\n\nAn incumbent independent senator may lodge a written statement setting out up \nto three preference orders of all candidates in the election. The statement must be \nsigned by the candidate and lodged with the relevant AEO, and must show a first \npreference for the incumbent senator. The preference ordering may be specified in \nthe form of a how-to-vote card.\n\nIncumbent independent senators must signal their intention to lodge an \nindividual voting ticket before the close of nominations.\n\nOrder of names on ballot papers \n\nA system called ‘double randomisation’ – two random draws – is used for \ndetermining the order of groups and ungrouped candidates on Senate ballot papers \nand the order of candidates on House of Representatives ballot papers.  \nAll candidates and members of the public are welcome to attend these draws.\n\nHouse of Representatives ballot papers \n\nThe DRO declares the House of Representatives nominations received for their \ndivision at 12 noon, 24 hours after the close of nominations. Following the \ndeclaration the DRO conducts two draws for ballot paper positions.\n\nThe first draw assigns a number to each candidate and the second draw determines \nthe order in which candidates appear on the ballot paper.\n\nSenate ballot papers\n\nThe AEO declares the nominations received for the Senate in their state or territory \nat 12 noon, 24 hours after the nominations close. After the declaration, the AEO \nconducts the draws for positions on the ballot paper.\n\nIn Senate elections, the names of candidates included in groups are placed on  \nthe ballot paper to the left and ahead of the names of candidates not included  \nin groups.\n\nCandidates Handbook  Federal elections  |  By-elections  Page 40\n\n\n--- Page 43 ---\n\nFor the purposes of the Senate draw and ballot paper printing, individual incumbent \nsenators who have given written notice of an intention to lodge a voting ticket are \ntreated as a group.\n\nThe AEO determines the order of groups and ungrouped candidates on the ballot \npaper by conducting a public draw for positions. This draw is conducted in two parts, \nwith each part consisting of two draws:\n\n ■ in the first part, the first draw allocates a number to each group and the second \n\ndraw determines the order in which the groups appear on the  \nballot paper.\n\n ■ in the second part, the first draw allocates a number to each ungrouped \n\ncandidate and the second draw determines the order in which ungrouped \ncandidates appear on the ballot paper.\n\nUngrouped candidates do not lodge a group voting ticket and so do not have a box \nabove the line on the Senate ballot paper.\n\nCandidates Handbook  Federal elections  |  By-elections  Page 41\n\n\n--- Page 44 ---\n\n4.

Party workers are reminded it is an \noffence to print, publish or distribute misleading or deceptive statements relating \nto the actual marking of a ballot paper. When producing HTV material, parties and \ncandidates need to be mindful of the colour and size of their material so as to avoid \nany confusion between the HTV material and ballot papers issued to electors by the \nAEC. HTV cards must carry:\n\n ■ the name and full street address of the authorising representative.\n\n ■ the political party of the candidate. If the candidate is not endorsed by a \n\nregistered political party, the name of the candidate and the word ‘candidate’ \nneeds to be included.\n\nA person must not publish a HTV card during an election period unless the name \nof the registered political party or candidate on whose behalf the card has been \npublished is clearly printed at either the bottom or top of each printed face of  \nthe card.\n\nA HTV card is defined in subsection 4(1) of the Act. In short, it is any printed  \nmedium that lists the name of two or more candidates and directs or encourages \nelectors to mark their preference for the candidates in a particular order. It does \nnot include a card that only relates to first preference votes or only relates to last \npreference votes.\n\nCandidates Handbook  Federal elections  |  By-elections  Page 42\n\n\n--- Page 45 ---\n\nThere is a general prohibition on canvassing within six metres of an \nentrance to a polling place, which means that HTV cards or other non-AEC \nnotices cannot be distributed or displayed within that distance. HTV cards \nmust not be exhibited or left in a polling place.\n\nAppendix 1 lists the offences under the Act.\n\nHTV cards produced for electors by political parties and candidates need to have \nclear instructions and be well designed so they assist electors to cast a formal vote. \nOtherwise, HTV information may confuse some voters and cause them to cast an \ninformal vote without meaning to do so.\n\nHTV cards for electors serviced by mobile polling teams may be supplied by party \nworkers to the team leader of a mobile polling team. It is not the responsibility of the \nteam leader to arrange for this or to remind party workers to do so. Mobile polling \nteams will provide the electoral material to electors on request.\n\nElectoral advertising \n\nThe Electoral Backgrounder on Electoral Advertising provides a basic introduction \nto electoral advertising and is available from the AEC website. Its contents are a \nguide only. Individual matters are assessed on a case-by-case basis and ultimately \nit is for the courts to decide upon the interpretation of the law in any particular \ncase. Accordingly, if you are in doubt about the interpretation of the law in particular \ncircumstances, you should seek your own independent legal advice.\n\nCandidates Handbook  Federal elections  |  By-elections  Page 43\n\n\n--- Page 46 ---\n\nThe Electoral Backgrounder on Electoral Advertising discusses:\n\n ■ intent of the law\n\n ■ authorisation of electoral advertising\n\n ■ headings to electoral advertisements\n\n ■ electoral advertising on the Internet\n\n ■ misleading and deceptive electoral advertisements\n\n ■ second preference how-to-vote cards\n\n ■ truth in political advertising\n\n ■ defamation of candidates\n\n ■ electronic media blackout\n\n ■ political advertising bans\n\n ■ non-compliance, such as electoral advertising offences\n\n ■ complaints.\n\nCandidates are encouraged to pay particular attention to the authorisation \nof electoral advertising.\n\nCandidates Handbook  Federal elections  |  By-elections  Page 44\n\n\n--- Page 47 ---\n\n5. Election funding and financial disclosure\n ■ Part XX, ‘Election funding and financial disclosure’\n\nSome candidates will be eligible to receive payment of election funding following \na federal election but all candidates are required to lodge a compulsory financial \ndisclosure return. Candidates can appoint an agent to receive their election funding \n(if eligible) and complete the financial disclosure return on their behalf.\n\nThis section gives a brief overview of the role of candidate agents and Senate group \nagents, financial disclosure obligations and payment of election funding.\n\nFurther detailed information on election funding and candidate financial disclosure \ncan be obtained from the AEC website.\n\nAgents \n\nAppointing an agent\n\nAgent appointment forms are available by phoning 13 23 26 or from the  \nAEC website. \n\nA party agent is not automatically appointed as a candidate or Senate group agent \nunless individually appointed by each endorsed candidate of that party.\n\nIt is your responsibility to ensure that your agent appointment form is received by the \nAEC’s National Office in Canberra before the close of nominations. Completed forms \ncan be faxed to 02 6293 7655, scanned and emailed to fad@aec.gov.au, or sent by \npost. Postal address details are available on the forms.\n\nAgent appointment forms should only be sent to the AEC’s National Office, \nnot sent to any other office.\n\nCandidates Handbook  Federal elections  |  By-elections  Page 45\n\n\n--- Page 48 ---\n\nAn agent cannot be appointed if their appointment form is received by the AEC’s \nNational Office after the close of nominations. In this case, individual candidates will \nbe responsible for completing their own financial disclosure return.\n\nThe appointment is valid for a single election only.\n\nCandidate agents\n\nEach candidate may appoint an agent whether or not they are endorsed by a party. \nCandidates who do not appoint an agent are deemed to be their own agent.\n\nSenate group agent\n\nSenate groups, the members of which have been endorsed by a single party, \nare not required to appoint an agent for the group or lodge a disclosure return. All \nreceipts and expenditure of a Senate group should be included in the annual return \nof that party, however, individual members of such a group may appoint an agent.\n\nAn agent is not the agent of the individual members of the group unless separately \nappointed as such.\n\nIf no agent is appointed for a Senate group, or the agent appointment form is \nreceived by the AEC’s National Office in Canberra after the close of nominations, the \nfirst candidate listed in the Senate group is deemed to be the agent.\n\nSenate groups endorsed by more than one party may appoint an agent for the \ngroup. If no appointment is made the person whose name appears first on the ballot \npaper is deemed to be the agent.\n\nUnendorsed Senate groups can appoint an agent for the group. If no appointment \nis made the person whose name appears first on the ballot paper is deemed to be \nthe agent for the group.\n\nEligibility of an agent \n\nTo be eligible for appointment as an agent, the nominated person must:\n\n ■ be at least 18 years of age,\n\n ■ not have been convicted of an offence under the funding and disclosure \n\nprovisions of the Act,\n\n ■ have signed a consent to the appointment, and\n\n ■ have signed a declaration of eligibility for appointment.\n\nCandidates Handbook  Federal elections  |  By-elections  Page 46\n\n\n--- Page 49 ---\n\nA person may be appointed as the agent for multiple candidates, including a Senate \ngroup, but a separate form must be completed for each appointment.\n\nElection funding \n\nCandidates who receive four per cent or more of the formal first preference votes \nin an election are entitled to receive election funding. For Senate groups, the group \nas a whole must receive at least four per cent of the formal first preference votes in \ntheir state or territory in order to be eligible for election funding.\n\nThe amount to be paid is calculated by multiplying the number of formal first \npreference votes received by the funding rate. The funding rate applicable to this \nsection is available on the AEC website.\n\nAt least 95 per cent of election funding is paid in the fourth week after election day \non the basis of votes counted as at the 20th day after election day. The balance is \npaid when the count is finalised and verified, and when the full entitlement is known.\n\nIn the case of independent candidates or Senate groups, payment is made to the \nagent of the candidate or group. If no agent is appointed, payment is made to the \ncandidate or the member of the Senate group placed first in the group.\n\nIn the case of endorsed candidates and Senate groups, funding is paid to the party \nagent of the endorsing party or parties.\n\nDetailed information about the payment arrangements for parties endorsing \ncandidates or Senate groups can be obtained from the AEC website.\n\nFinancial disclosure returns \n\nFollowing an election, candidate and Senate group agents must lodge financial \ndisclosure returns with the AEC. Further information, including a comprehensive \nfunding and disclosure guides, is available on the AEC website.\n\nIf a candidate or Senate group does not appoint an agent or the appointment form is \nreceived by the AEC’s National Office in Canberra after the close of nominations:\n\n ■ the candidate is deemed to be their own agent.\n\n ■ the first person listed in the Senate group is deemed to be the group agent.\n\nCandidates Handbook  Federal elections  |  By-elections  Page 47\n\n\n--- Page 50 ---\n\nFailure to lodge a disclosure return is an offence which may be referred to the \nCommonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions.\n\nElection donations \n\nElection donations may be in cash (money, direct deposit or cheque), or ‘in-kind’ \nsuch as professional services or office equipment provided free of charge or at less \nthan normal commercial value. Donations may be received directly by the candidate \nor by someone acting on behalf, or with the authority, of the candidate or Senate \ngroup.\n\nIn-kind donations must be disclosed at the normal commercial or sale value of the \nitem or service.\n\nPeople or organisations making donations to a candidate in excess of the applicable \ndisclosure threshold are also required to lodge a financial disclosure return with \nthe AEC.\n\nIf a person or organisation makes a donation to the campaign committee of an \nendorsed candidate, this is treated as though the donation is made to the relevant \npolitical party and is therefore required to be reported in the party’s annual \ndisclosure returns rather than the candidate’s election return.\n\nElectoral expenditure \n\nAll electoral or campaign expenditure incurred in each of the following categories \nmust be reported:\n\n ■ broadcasting advertisements (including production costs)\n\n ■ publishing advertisements (including production costs)\n\n ■ displaying advertisements at a theatre or other place of entertainment \n\n(including production costs)\n\n ■ costs of campaign material that was used or distributed where the name and \naddress of the author, or the authorising person, is required (such as how-to-\nvote cards, pamphlets or posters)\n\n ■ direct mailing\n\n ■ opinion polling and other research relating to the election.\n\nCandidates Handbook  Federal elections  |  By-elections  Page 48\n\n\n--- Page 51 ---\n\nCertain other campaign expenditure (for example, hire of premises or equipment, \nfreight, telephone and travel costs) does not have to be reported.\n\nCandidates \n\nAll candidates, including the individual members of a Senate group, have a financial \ndisclosure obligation after the election.\n\nAll candidates must lodge a financial disclosure return even when no donations were \nreceived or expenditure incurred. In this case ‘nil’ returns must be lodged.\n\nThe financial disclosure returns of candidates must include the following:\n\n ■ the number of donors and total amount of all donations received\n\n ■ the names and details of people and organisations who made donations in \nexcess of the disclosure threshold (this information is available on the AEC \nwebsite)\n\n ■ all amounts spent on certain types of electoral expenditure.\n\nThe only exception is for electoral expenditure incurred by candidates who stand \nas part of a Senate group. These candidates do not separately disclose electoral \nexpenditure as the expenditure of all members of the group is consolidated and \nreported as part of the group financial disclosure, or by the party if all members of \nthe group are endorsed by the same party.\n\nSenate groups\n\nAll Senate groups must lodge a disclosure return with the exception of Senate groups \nwhose members are all endorsed by the same party. These groups report through \ntheir political party. Disclosure returns must be lodged even when no donations were \nreceived or expenditure incurred. In this case ‘nil’ returns must be lodged.\n\nThe financial disclosure returns of Senate groups must include:\n\n ■ the number of donors and total amount of all donations received\n\n ■ names and details of people and organisations who made donations in excess \n\nof the applicable disclosure threshold\n\n ■ all amounts spent on certain types of electoral expenditure.\n\nCandidates Handbook  Federal elections  |  By-elections  Page 49\n\n\n--- Page 52 ---\n\nWhere and when to lodge returns \n\nReturns can be prepared and lodged online via the eReturns portal. The eReturns \nportal can be accessed from  https://ereturns.aec.gov.au or via the AEC website. \nThe easiest way to lodge a return accurately and on time is to use the eReturns \nportal, it is quick, secure, environmentally friendly and allows importing of files \nwhich eliminates transcription errors. To assist with completing a return online, a \nstep-by-step guide is available on the AEC’s website.\n\nIf a candidate or agent is unable to lodge a return online via the eReturns portal \nthe relevant forms may be downloaded from the AEC website.

Scrutineers\n\n ■ Part XVI, ‘The polling’\n\n ■ Part XVIII, ‘The scrutiny’\n\nAs a candidate you have a range of clearly defined rights and responsibilities, but \nyou are not permitted to participate in the administrative conduct of an election.\n\nBecause of this exclusion you have the right to appoint scrutineers to represent you \nat polling places and during the various stages of counting of ballot papers (the \nscrutiny).\n\nThe Scrutineers Handbook sets out how the law provides for the appointment of \nscrutineers, as well as the rights and responsibilities of scrutineers.\n\nWhat is the role of scrutineers?\n\nOn behalf of candidates, scrutineers have the right to be present in order to check \nany possible irregularities when the ballot boxes are sealed, when they are opened, \nand when the votes are sorted and counted.\n\nScrutineers may observe:\n\n ■ the polling in a polling place\n\n ■ the scrutiny in a counting centre\n\n ■ the preliminary scrutiny of declaration envelopes\n\n ■ the further scrutiny of declaration votes\n\n ■ the fresh scrutiny of all votes.\n\nCandidates Handbook  Federal elections  |  By-elections  Page 52\n\n\n--- Page 55 ---\n\nAppointment of scrutineers by candidates \n\nAt early voting and during polling \nThe Act s.200DA and s.217\n\nYou may appoint scrutineers to represent you at every polling place.\n\nHowever, no more than one scrutineer per candidate is allowed in an early voting \ncentre at the one time and no more than one scrutineer per candidate is allowed for \neach issuing point at a polling place on election day.\n\nYou appoint scrutineers by completing a scrutineer appointment form for each \nscrutineer. This can be obtained from any AEC divisional office or from the  \nAEC website. \n\nYou must give the name and residential address of the scrutineer and sign the form. \nA facsimile of your signature is acceptable.\n\nYou may fax the form to the DRO or the Officer in Charge of a polling place, if such \nfacilities are available.\n\nAt the preliminary scrutiny of declaration votes\n\nThe DRO conducts the preliminary scrutiny of declaration vote envelopes. This \nprocess determines which declaration votes are admissible and can proceed \nto further scrutiny. The number of scrutineers permitted per candidate for the \npreliminary scrutiny is limited to the number of officers engaged in the scrutiny.\n\nThe preliminary scrutiny of early declaration vote envelopes can begin on the \nMonday before election day. This helps the DRO begin the further scrutiny of these \ntypes of declaration votes promptly after election day.\n\nEarly declaration vote envelopes are checked to ensure they have been signed by \nthe voter and that the voter is correctly enrolled.\n\nAny envelopes requiring further investigation will be put aside until after the close of \npolling.\n\nThe DRO will contact you before the preliminary scrutiny to advise you of its times, \ndates and locations.\n\nThe Scrutineers Handbook is available on the AEC website, from all AEC offices or by \nphoning 13 23 26.\n\nCandidates Handbook  Federal elections  |  By-elections  Page 53\n\n\n--- Page 56 ---\n\nNo declaration vote envelope can be opened or ballot papers scrutinised \nbefore the close of the poll.\n\nAt the scrutiny\nThe Act, s.264\nYou may also appoint scrutineers to represent you at the checking and counting \nof the ballot papers after the close of polling. The number of scrutineers who may \nrepresent you at each counting centre is limited to the number of officers engaged in \nthe counting of ballot papers.\n\nThe appointment of a scrutineer must be made in writing and given or sent to \nthe officer conducting the scrutiny at the counting centre. You must sign the \nappointment form (a facsimile of your signature is acceptable), which must give \nthe name and address of the scrutineer. Once again, a fax is acceptable if these \nfacilities are available.\n\nYou may use the same form to appoint scrutineers for both the polling and  \nthe scrutiny.\n\nYou may scrutineer on behalf of another candidate at a scrutiny as long as the \nballot papers being scrutinised are not related to the election in which you are a \ncandidate. For example, a House of Representatives candidate in Division A may be \na scrutineer in Division B. You should check with the DRO or AEO (as appropriate) \nbefore making or accepting such an appointment to scrutineer.\n\nAt the further scrutiny of declaration votes\n\nThe DRO conducts the further scrutiny. At the further scrutiny, declaration vote \nenvelopes which have passed the preliminary scrutiny are opened, and the ballot \npapers extracted and counted.\n\nThe DRO will contact you before the further scrutiny to advise you of its times, dates \nand locations.\n\nScrutineers have the same rights and responsibilities at a further scrutiny as they \nhave at the scrutiny of ballot papers in a counting centre.\n\nCandidates Handbook  Federal elections  |  By-elections  Page 54\n\n\n--- Page 57 ---\n\nScrutineers Handbook\n\nMore detailed information concerning the rights, duties, powers and functions of \nscrutineers during polling and scrutiny is contained in the Scrutineers Handbook.\n\nThe Scrutineers Handbook also explains the different methods of voting, matters \nrelating to the formality and informality of House of Representatives and Senate \nballot papers, and the conduct of House of Representatives and Senate scrutinies.\n\nCandidates Handbook  Federal elections  |  By-elections  Page 55\n\n\n--- Page 58 ---\n\n7. Counting the votes\n ■ Part XVIII, ‘The scrutiny’\n\nAn understanding of the AEC’s counting procedures will help you, as a candidate, \nknow what to expect as the results of the election unfold. This chapter details how \nthe scrutiny or count is approached for the House of Representatives and Senate.\n\nOn election night\n\nThe counting of ordinary votes begins in each polling place immediately after the \npoll closes at 6pm on election day. Ordinary votes are votes cast by electors either \nat a polling place within their division on election day, or as pre-poll ordinary votes at \nan early voting centre or divisional office in their division prior to election day. \n\nHouse of Representatives count on election night \n\nBallot papers are initially sorted by the polling officials into first preference votes for \neach candidate and informal ballot papers. The results are then tabulated and the \nfirst preference vote figures for each candidate are telephoned to the  \nrelevant DRO.\n\nDivisional staff then enter these figures for each polling place in their division into \nthe national computerised Election Management System which, in turn, updates the \nVirtual Tally Room (VTR). The VTR can be accessed on the AEC website (see page \n57).\n\nIndicative two-candidate-preferred (TCP) \n\nOn the completion of the count of first preferences for the House of Representatives \nat each polling place, the Officer in Charge must, as directed by the relevant AEO \n(in accordance with s274(2A) of the Act), conduct an indicative distribution of \npreferences on a two-candidate-preferred (TCP) basis.\n\nThe TCP count shows where preferences have been distributed to the probable \nfinal two candidates in an election. It must be remembered that this count is only \n\nCandidates Handbook  Federal elections  |  By-elections  Page 56\n\n\n--- Page 59 ---\n\nan indicative result of the election in a division. It is possible that early, absent and \nmobile votes, counted after election day, could alter the outcome.\n\nThe ballot papers for the two nominated candidates are set aside and the ballot \npapers for the remaining candidates are distributed to one of the two nominated \ncandidates according to who is more preferred or gets the ‘best preference’.\n\nFor example, if the two nominated candidates are Labor and Liberal then a ballot \npaper which has ‘1’ Democrats, ‘2’ Independent, ‘3’ Labor and then ‘4’ Liberal will \nbe added to the first preference figures for the Labor candidate. Conversely, a ballot \npaper that showed ‘1’ Independent ‘2’ Liberal (etc) would be added to the first \npreference figures for the Liberal candidate.\n\nLike the count of first preference votes, this result is telephoned through to the DRO, \nwho enters it into the Election Inquiry System. This will update the VTR, which is \navailable on the AEC website.\n\nSenate count on election night\n\nThe counting of Senate ballot papers also begins on election night. The first \npreference votes on the Senate ballot papers – above the line and below the line are \ncounted. A single figure for each group and each ungrouped candidate is reported.\n\nSenate results cannot be calculated until the state or territory-wide total of votes \nused to determine the quota – the proportion of votes required by a candidate to \nbe elected is known. It is only possible, therefore, to get a general impression of the \nSenate results on election night.\n\nThe Senate count on election night begins at the same time as the TCP count for the \nHouse of Representatives. Results from the Senate count are telephoned through \nto the DRO, and group totals and ungrouped results are entered into the Election \nInquiry System in the same way as House of Representatives votes.\n\nVirtual Tally Room \n\nThe AEC hosts a website election results system known as the Virtual Tally Room \n(VTR), which provides election information and results in a user-friendly format.\n\nThe VTR allows people visiting the site on election night and the weeks following to \naccess progressive House of Representatives results and figures from the Senate \ncount for all states and territories, together with a comprehensive range of summary \n\nCandidates Handbook  Federal elections  |  By-elections  Page 57\n\n\n--- Page 60 ---\n\nand analysis screens. The VTR produces approximately 1 200 individual pages of \nresults on election night and more than 20 000 pages in the post-election period. \nThese results are updated regularly on election night and in the post-election period.\n\nAfter election night\n\nFresh scrutiny or recheck \n\nThe initial scrutiny conducted at the polling place on election night is routinely \nfollowed by a ‘fresh scrutiny’ or re-check of votes cast conducted by the DRO in the \ndays following election day. The exact time will be advised by the DRO.\n\nAt this stage, some ballot papers earlier treated as informal may be admitted to the \nscrutiny by the DRO, and some ballot papers originally treated as formal may be \nreclassified as informal.\n\nA full distribution of preferences is conducted in every House of Representatives \ndivision, even where a candidate already has an absolute majority of first preference \nvotes. The result of this full distribution of preferences is used to calculate the \ntwo-candidate-preferred statistics.\n\nScrutineers who have been appointed by a candidate for the division may be present \nduring the fresh scrutiny. The number of scrutineers present during the count is \nlimited to one per candidate for each AEC staff member involved in the scrutiny. \n\nAfter election night the AEC conducts the Central Senate Scrutiny (CSS) process in \neach state and territory. The Senate scrutiny and the distribution of preferences are \nconducted using a computer application. This involves double data entry of all ballot \npapers that are marked below the line and have been dispatched to the CSS. Ballot \npapers marked above the line only are entered as a single total for each group. The \ncomputerised system calculates the quota, distributes preferences and determines \nthe result of the Senate election.\n\nThis system provides full accountability and an audit trail, including reports for \ninspection by scrutineers. \n\nThe relevant AEO notifies all Senate candidates by letter of the location and hours of \noperation of the CSS centre in that state or territory.\n\nCandidates Handbook  Federal elections  |  By-elections  Page 58\n\n\n--- Page 61 ---\n\nDeclaration votes\n\nDeclaration votes do not get counted on election night; instead, they are counted \nin the divisional office in the period following election night. The counting of these \nvotes takes longer than the counting of ordinary votes.\n\nIn the days following election day, a ‘declaration vote exchange’ is carried out \nbetween the divisions within each state and territory, where declaration votes are \nphysically passed on to the relevant division. Declaration votes received on behalf \nof divisions in another state or territory or overseas are sent to that state or territory \nand are then distributed to the relevant divisions. Once the declaration votes are \nreceived and processed in the home division, the counting of these votes can begin.\n\nPostal Votes\n\nFor federal elections and by-elections, the legislation requires the AEC to wait for \nup to 13 days after election day for any postal votes to be received. These votes are \nincluded in the count if:\n\n ■ the vote has been cast before 6pm on election day\n\n ■ the vote is received by the DRO within 13 days of election day.\n\nFor this reason, the counting of postal votes is an ongoing process for up to 13 days \nafter election day.\n\nCandidates Handbook  Federal elections  |  By-elections  Page 59\n\n\n--- Page 62 ---\n\n8. Recounts and disputed returns\n\n ■ Part XVIII, ‘The scrutiny’\n\n ■ Part XXII, ‘Court of Disputed Returns’\n\nYou, as a candidate, can benefit from a good understanding of the circumstances \nand procedures leading to a recount of votes in an election, as well as the \ncircumstances under which the High Court would sit as a Court of Disputed Returns.\n\nAs a candidate you can request a recount of ballot papers in an election, however, \nthe electoral official is not automatically obliged to accept your request. The official \nalso has the power to direct a recount at their discretion without waiting for  \na request.\n\nRecounts\nThe Act, ss.278 and 279\n\nA recount may be undertaken, approved or directed at any time before the result of \nan election is declared. It should not be confused with the routine re-check (fresh \nscrutiny) of the House of Representatives votes counted on election night.\n\nIn the absence of specifically alleged errors it is unlikely that a recount would \nbe required at either a House of Representatives election or Senate election. \nHowever, in the case of a House of Representatives division, if the margin of votes \nat the completion of the distribution of preferences is less than 100, a recount is \nconducted as a matter of course.\n\nGiven the checks and balances in scrutiny systems, significant sorting errors are \nhighly unlikely to go undetected.\n\nCandidates Handbook  Federal elections  |  By-elections  Page 60\n\n\n--- Page 63 ---\n\nHouse of Representatives recount\n\nIf requesting a recount, House of Representatives candidates must write to the \nrelevant DRO giving their reasons for the request.\n\nDROs may initiate a recount, or be directed by the Electoral Commissioner at any \ntime before the declaration of a result of a House of Representatives election to \nrecount all or some of the ballot papers.\n\nThe DRO must notify each candidate of the time and place of any recount.\n\nThe DRO conducting a recount has the same powers as if the recount was \nthe original scrutiny. A DRO may reverse any decision in the scrutiny to \nadmit or reject a ballot paper.\n\nDuring a recount the DRO may, and at the request of a scrutineer must, reserve any \nballot paper for the decision of the AEO. The AEO must decide whether any ballot \npaper reserved for their decision is to be admitted or rejected. If a ballot paper is \nconsidered as being admitted by the AEO, the DRO will determine to whom the first \npreference has been allocated.\n\nIf an election result is challenged, the High Court of Australia, sitting as the  \nCourt of Disputed Returns, may consider any ballot paper reserved for the  \ndecision of the AEO, but may only order a further recount if it is satisfied that a \nrecount is justified.\n\nEvaluating a request for a House of Representatives recount \n\nThe general guidelines observed in evaluating requests for a recount are  \nas follows.\n\n ■ A recount may take place where there are valid and specific grounds for \n\nsupposing that it could change the result of the election in the division or where \nthere are specific grounds for determining the need for a recount of specific \nballot papers (such as in response to specific allegations  \nor incidents).\n\n ■ A request for a recount which does not plead any valid and specific grounds \n\nmust be refused. A request for a recount needs to identify specific ballot papers \nand associated significant counting process errors or irregularities that could \nchange the result of an election within a division.\n\nCandidates Handbook  Federal elections  |  By-elections  Page 61\n\n\n--- Page 64 ---\n\n■ Wherever possible, the grounds pleaded by the candidate requesting the \n\nrecount will be used to narrow down to as small a category as possible the \nballot papers that need to be re-examined.\n\n ■ Where the margin of votes at the completion of the distribution of preferences \n\nfor a House of Representative division is less than 100, a recount will be \nundertaken as a matter of course.\n\n ■ Only one recount of any set of ballot papers will occur.\n\n ■ Requests for recounts will only be considered, and actioned, in the period after \nthe completion of all scrutinies and before the declaration of the poll in the \ndivision.\n\nSenate recount\n\nIf requesting a recount, Senate candidates must write to the AEO for the state or \nterritory giving their reasons for the request.\n\nIf the AEO for the state or territory refuses a request from a candidate to direct a \nrecount of any Senate ballot papers, the candidate may appeal in writing to the \nElectoral Commissioner. The Electoral Commissioner is empowered to either direct \nor refuse a recount.\n\nEvaluating a request for a Senate Recount\n\nThe guidelines for evaluating a request for a Senate Recount are detailed in the \nAEC’s Recount Policy for Senate Elections.\n\nFor more information on formality, see Ballot paper formality guidelines on \nthe AEC website.\n\nCandidates Handbook  Federal elections  |  By-elections  Page 62\n\n\n--- Page 65 ---\n\nCourt of Disputed Returns \nThe Act, Part XXII \n\nAnyone contemplating a challenge to an election result should consult their own \nlegal advisers. The validity of the election of any member of parliament may only be \ndisputed by a petition to the Court of Disputed Returns within 40 days of the return \nof the writ. The Common Informers (Parliamentary Disqualifications) Act 1975 \nprovides penalties for ineligible members of parliament who sit as members or \nsenators. Such an action has to be argued in the High Court under section 5 of  \nthat Act.\n\nThe Act, s.360(1) \n\nThe Court of Disputed Returns sits as an open court.

The intent of the \nAct is:\n\n ■ to ensure electors are informed about the source of political advertising, and\n\n ■ to ensure that political advertising does not mislead or deceive electors about \n\nthe way in which a vote must be cast.\n\nThe AEC therefore has no role or responsibility in deciding whether political \nmessages published or broadcast in relation to a federal election are true or \nuntrue. The AEC does have a role however, in doing its best to ensure that \nelectoral advertisements are properly authorised, so that electors can know who is \nresponsible for the statements contained in them.\n\nComplaints must be made in writing, addressed to the Deputy Electoral \nCommissioner, and be accompanied by evidence of the material in question. This \ncould be an original copy of a how-to-vote card, an electoral advertisement or other \ndocuments relevant to the allegation. Depending on the nature of the document in \nquestion, a scanned copy or an emailed photograph may be acceptable.\n\nThis provides the context for preliminary assessment of the matter and also enables \nrelevant evidence to be tendered in court if proceedings are undertaken at a later \ndate. The complainant should also provide as much additional information as \npossible to enable assessment of the alleged breach. The AEC will immediately \nacknowledge receipt of the complaint.\n\nIf an original copy cannot be obtained, a copy of the entire document may be \nforwarded to the AEC. Similarly, for a complaint about electoral advertisements on \nthe Internet, the complaint should, if possible, be accompanied by a print copy of \nthe webpage, showing the advertisement, from which the AEC can make a formal \nassessment of its compliance with the law.\n\nIn the absence of a printed copy of the advertisement as it appeared on the Internet \nbeing provided with the complaint, the AEC will require enough information about \nthe Internet site in order to locate the advertisement and make an assessment \nregarding compliance with the Act.\n\nCandidates Handbook  Federal elections  |  By-elections  Page 73\n\n\n--- Page 76 ---\n\nFor more detailed information on the regulation of electoral \nadvertisements, you should refer to the Electoral Backgrounder on \nElectoral Advertising, which is available on the AEC website or from AEC \nnational and state offices.\n\nPhotographers and media \n\nPhotographers and members of the media or their equipment must not hinder, \ninconvenience or delay any polling staff or voters. No photographs may be taken of a \nperson recording a vote that would in any way identify how the person has voted.\n\nAnyone arranging for photographers or media to visit polling places should contact \nthe DRO in sufficient time to enable arrangements to be made with the officer-in-\ncharge at the relevant polling place.\n\nMembers of the media or photographers must have the permission of the DRO \nbefore visiting a polling place, and they must have the permission of the relevant \nDRO and the institution concerned before visiting any place where mobile polling is \nbeing conducted.\n\nFurther information, including guidelines on media coverage in polling \nplaces, is available on the AEC website or from AEC national and state \noffices.\n\nCandidates Handbook  Federal elections  |  By-elections  Page 74\n\n\n--- Page 77 ---\n\nAppendix 2: Additional information \navailable to candidates \n\nThe AEC produces a range of publications for candidates in addition to the \nCandidates Handbook. These include:\n\n ■ Scrutineers Handbook: information for scrutineers in the election\n\n ■ Electoral Pocketbook: a quick reference guide to the last federal election\n\n ■ Nomination Guide for Candidates: a quick reference guide for prospective \n\ncandidates\n\n ■ Ballot paper formality guidelines: information on the formality and informality of \n\nballot papers\n\n ■ Electoral Backgrounders: backgrounders discuss particular issues in the \n\nelectoral process\n\n ■ Funding and Disclosure Guides: separate guides for candidates, political parties \n\nand donors.\n\nOther information materials will be available during the election campaign. A copy \nof the Scrutineers Handbook is given to each candidate when they nominate at a \ndivisional office.\n\nGeneral information on a range of topics is available from all AEC offices, by phoning \n13 23 26 or by visiting the AEC website.\n\nCandidate information sessions\n\nTo assist political parties and individuals who are interested in nominating as \ncandidates for the federal election, information sessions are conducted in each \nstate and territory. These sessions provide an overview of the electoral process, \nincluding information on the nomination process and the rights and responsibilities \nof candidates.\n\nTo find out more about the candidate information sessions, contact the AEC on  \n13 23 26 or see the AEC website.\n\nCandidates Handbook  Federal elections  |  By-elections  Page 75\n\n\n--- Page 78 ---\n\nOfficial material available to candidates\n\nHouse of Representatives candidates are entitled to receive a copy of the certified \nlist of voters for the division for which they are seeking election, as soon as they are \nproduced after the close of the rolls for the election.\n\nSenate candidates are not entitled to copies of the certified list.

If so, you will need a clear understanding of \nthe legislative requirements you must meet, and of your role and responsibilities under the law.\n\nRemember, you and your supporters can play a significant role in helping to ensure, as far as \npossible, that every vote cast in an election counts.\n\nThe Candidates Handbook\n\nThis handbook is published by the Australian \nElectoral Commission (AEC), the Commonwealth \nagency which maintains the electoral roll and \nconducts federal elections, by-elections and \nreferendums. The handbook covers the stages \nfor the electoral process relevant to candidates.\n\nEach chapter in the handbook lists the relevant \nparts of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 \n(the Act), detailing how the electoral law applies \nto candidates and those assisting them.\n\nThe AEC suggests that you consult the \nCommonwealth of Australia Constitution Act \n(the Constitution), the Act and other legislation, \nincluding the Referendum (Machinery Provisions) \nAct 1984 referred to for the exact provisions.\n\nCandidates must satisfy themselves about their \nown legal position and, if necessary, refer to the \nexact provisions of the Constitution and the Act, \nand consult their own lawyers.\n\nYou can access this handbook, the Constitution \nand the Act via the AEC website.\n\nOffences relating to the election, whether they \noccur before or during the election, are listed in \nAppendix 1. Some electoral offences apply at all \ntimes, while others apply to specific periods.\n\nThe AEC can assist you by providing information \nof a general nature about the nomination \nprocess and campaign activity. However, we \ncannot provide you with formal or informal \nlegal advice.\n\nAbbreviations and acronyms have been kept to a \nminimum. However, seven are used throughout \nthis handbook:\n\n ■ AEC – Australian Electoral Commission\n\n ■ AEO – Australian Electoral Officer\n\n ■ ARO – Assistant Returning Officer\n\n ■ DRO – Divisional Returning Officer\n\n ■ the Act – Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918\n\n ■ HoR – House of Representatives\n\n ■ CSS – the Central Senate Scrutiny\n\nThe words ‘voter’ and ‘elector’ are used \ninterchangeably.\n\nAt the end of this handbook you will find a \nglossary which explains terms that may be \nunfamiliar to you.\n\nHow this handbook can help you\n\nThe handbook explains the steps you will need \nto take to qualify as a candidate and to comply \nwith the law before, during and after an election.\n\nAt the end of this introductory section you will \nfind a checklist that takes you through important \ndetails you will need to know and the activities \nyou will need to undertake as a candidate, and \nindicates where in the handbook you can find \nmore information.\n\nAgain, the handbook is intended to assist \ncandidates standing for election by explaining \nrelevant processes and procedures. It is not, \nhowever, a substitute for the law.\n\nCandidates Handbook 2016 \n\n5\n\n\n--- Page 6 ---\n\nPublic inspection\n\nYou need to be aware that many of the \ndocuments you submit in relation to your \ncandidacy will be made available for public \ninspection. These include your nomination form \nand your financial disclosure return. Exceptions \nmay apply in certain circumstances.\n\nAEC website\n\nBecause information can change during the life \nof a publication, the AEC website is the best \nsource of up-to-date information.\n\nAll forms and publications referred to in this \nhandbook are available from the website or by \ncontacting the AEC on 13 23 26.\n\nAEC National, State, Territory and \nDivision Office contact details\n\nYou will find office contact details on the AEC \nwebsite.\n\nWhat’s new at this election?\n\nChanges to Senate voting that will \napply at this election \n\nThe Parliament has recently passed legislative \nchanges to the voting method for electing \nSenators. \n\nThe changes impact on how voters complete \ntheir Senate ballot paper and how the Senate \nballot papers are counted.\n\nThese changes are explained in detail below in \nthe section on Ballot Papers.\n\nCounting of Senate votes\n\nThe counting of Senate votes will also be \ndifferent.\n\nAs a result of the recent changes passed by the \nParliament, the scrutiny of Senate votes will be \ncarried out by the AEO at the CSS centre in each \nState or Territory.\n\nOn polling night, at each polling place, the \nARO is required to count the total number of \nSenate ballot papers and the number of first \npreferences above the line (ATL). It is AEC policy \nfor the ARO to also count the number of first \npreferences below the line (BTL) for each group \nand ungrouped candidate and to also count the \nobviously informal ballot papers. \n\nAfter polling day, the DRO repeats the count \nprocess undertaken by the ARO before \nforwarding the ballot papers to the CSS.\n\nThis means that while ballot papers where a \nfirst preference cannot be determined will be \nseparated from those where it can, it is only \nthe AEO who determines formality. The AEO \nwill be assisted in determining formality by a \ncomputerised scrutiny process.\n\nScrutineers have the opportunity to object to the \nformality of a Senate ballot paper at the CSS.\n\nPolitical party logos\n\nHoR and Senate ballot papers will look different \nat this election. Political parties that have \nregistered a logo with the AEC before the issue \nof writs for the election can request to have their \nparty logo printed on the ballot papers. The \ninclusion of a party logo is intended to reduce \nthe confusion that may arise where political \nparties have similar names.\n\nHandling of declaration votes\n\nA further change arising from the recent Senate \nreforms relates to the handling of declaration \nvotes.\n\nDeclaration vote ballot boxes will no longer be \nopened at polling locations. Instead they will \nremain sealed and transported to a divisional \noutpost where they will be stored securely until \nthey can then be opened, fully reconciled and \nthe declaration vote envelopes within forwarded \nto the relevant DRO for processing.\n\nCandidates Handbook 2016 \n\n6\n\n\n--- Page 7 ---\n\nUsually the House of Representatives and the \nhalf Senate elections are held at the same time. \nHowever, the Governor-General may dissolve \nboth Houses simultaneously upon certain \nconditions having been met under section 57 of \nthe Constitution, resulting in a general election \nfor the House of Representatives and all of the \nSenate. This is known as a double dissolution.\n\nThe key dates in the election timetable are \navailable on the AEC website.\n\nBy-elections\n\nWhenever a vacancy occurs in the House \nof Representatives because of the death, \nresignation, absence without leave, expulsion, \ndisqualification or ineligibility of a member, a writ \nmay be issued for the election of a new member. \nA writ may also be issued when the Court of \nDisputed Returns declares an election void.\n\nThe guiding principle in fixing the date of a by-\nelection has always been to hold the election \nas early as possible so that the electors are not \nleft without representation any longer than is \nnecessary.\n\nFeedback welcome\n\nThe AEC welcomes your views on the usefulness \nof the Candidates Handbook and any specific \ninformation provided in these pages. We invite \nyou to send your feedback via the AEC website.\n\nThe AEC also publishes Electoral Backgrounders \non specific aspects of electoral law. Copies of \nthese AEC publications can be accessed by \nvisiting the AEC website or by phoning 13 23 26.\n\nTiming of the election\n\nFederal elections\n\nThe constitutional and legislative frameworks that \ngovern Australian federal elections determine \nboth the election timetable and electoral \nprocesses.\n\nBoth Houses of Parliament have separate \nprovisions reflecting their different constitutional \nroles. A House of Representatives term expires \nthree years from its first official meeting, but can \nbe dissolved earlier. Once the term expires or is \ndissolved, the Governor-General will issue the \nwrits for an election.\n\nThe Senate is a continuing body with senators \nfor each state elected for a six-year term. A \nrotation system ensures that half the Senate \nis retired or up for election every three years. \nTwo senators represent the Australian Capital \nTerritory and two senators represent the \nNorthern Territory. These senators are elected \nconcurrently with the members of the House of \nRepresentatives. The duration of their term of \noffice also coincides with the members of the \nHouse of Representatives.\n\nCandidates Handbook 2016 \n\n7\n\n\n--- Page 8 ---\n\nChecklist\n\nI am aware of key dates in the election period following the issue of the writs\n\nI have familiarised myself with the law relating to electoral offences\n\nI have confirmed that I am qualified to nominate\n\nI have obtained the endorsement of a registered political party; or I have obtained \nthe signatures of eligible electors (for candidates who are not endorsed by a \nregistered political party only); or I am an incumbent independent and have \nobtained the signature of an eligible elector\n\nI have appointed an agent (optional)\n\nI have made a request to be included in a group on the Senate ballot papers \n(optional)\n\nSection\n\nThe writ\n\nAppendix 1\n\nNominations\n\nNominations\n\nNominations\n\nNominations\n\nI have provided all my personal information required on the nomination form\n\nNominations\n\nI have requested on the nomination form that the word ‘Independent’ be printed \non the ballot paper next to my name (this is optional for ungrouped Senate \ncandidates who are not endorsed by a registered political party)\n\nI have lodged my nomination form by the required deadline\n\nI have lodged my nomination deposit by the required deadline\n\nNominations\n\nNominations\n\nNominations\n\nI am aware of my responsibilities with regard to electoral advertising, particularly in \nrelation to How to Vote Cards\n\nVoting\n\nI have nominated a Candidate Agent or assume this responsibility myself\n\nI have, or my agent has, lodged my financial disclosure return by the due date \n(within 15 weeks after election day)\n\nElection funding \n& financial \ndisclosure\n\nElection funding \n& financial \ndisclosure\n\nI have appointed scrutineers (optional) by completing and signing the form\n\nScrutineers\n\nI am aware of the circumstances and procedures that may lead to a recount of \nvotes in an election\n\nRecounts & \ndisputed returns\n\nCandidates Handbook 2016 \n\n8\n\n\n--- Page 9 ---\n\nThe writ\n\nThe Act\n\nPart VIII, ‘Enrolment’\n\nPart XIII, ‘Writs for elections’\n\nPart XIX, ‘The return of the writs’\n\nThe issue of a writ triggers the election process and provides the opportunity for you to nominate as \na candidate.

They are addressed to the \nElectoral Commissioner, who advises each \nDivisional Returning Officer (DRO) of the dates \nspecified in the writs and directs them to make \nelection arrangements.\n\nEight writs are issued for each general election of \nthe House of Representatives: one in each state \nand one each for the Australian Capital Territory \nand Northern Territory.\n\nThe writ for the election of senators for a state \nis issued by the governor of the state and is \naddressed to the Australian Electoral Officer \n(AEO) for that particular state. The writ for the \nelection of senators for a territory is issued by the \nGovernor-General and is addressed to the AEO \nfor that particular territory.\n\nDates fixed in the writ\n\nThe Act, s.152 and s.154\n\nThe writ specifies the key dates of an election \nin accordance with the legislated election \ntimetable. These dates specify the timing for the \nclose of the rolls, the close of nominations, the \nelection day and the return of the writ.\n\nThe AEC advertises these dates within major \nnewspapers circulating in each state and territory \nand on the AEC website.

Section 44 of the Constitution is \nreproduced below.\n\n44. Any person who –\n\ni. \n\nii. \n\nis under any acknowledgment of allegiance, \nobedience, or adherence to a foreign power, \nor is a subject or a citizen or entitled to the \nrights or privileges of a subject or a citizen of \na foreign power; or\n\nis attainted of treason, or has been convicted \nand is under sentence, or subject to be \nsentenced, for any offence punishable under \nthe law of the Commonwealth or of a State \nby imprisonment for one year or longer; or\n\niii. \n\nis an undischarged bankrupt or insolvent; or\n\niv.  holds any office of profit under the Crown, or \nany pension payable during the pleasure of \nthe Crown out of any of the revenues of the \nCommonwealth; or\n\nv.  has any direct or indirect pecuniary interest \nin any agreement with the Public Service \nof the Commonwealth otherwise than as \na member and in common with the other \nmembers of an incorporated company \nconsisting of more than twenty-five persons; \n\nvi.  shall be incapable of being chosen or of \nsitting as a senator or a member of the \nHouse of Representatives.\n\nBut subsection (iv) does not apply to the office \nof any of the Queen’s Ministers of State for \nthe Commonwealth, or of any of the Queen’s \nMinisters for a State, or to the receipt of pay, half-\npay, or a pension, by any person as an officer \nor member of the Queen’s navy or army, or to \nthe receipt of pay as an officer or member of the \nnaval or military forces of the Commonwealth \nby any person whose services are not wholly \nemployed by the Commonwealth.\n\nThe Act, s.36\n\nNo candidate may be appointed as an electoral \nofficer of any description, either as a permanent \nofficer or as a polling official. If an electoral officer \nbecomes a candidate, they must vacate the \noffice.\n\nFor more information see the Electoral \nBackgrounder on Constitutional Disqualifications \nand Intending Candidates, which is available on \nthe AEC website or from AEC national and state \noffices.\n\n‘Office of profit’ disqualification\n\nIn its November 1992 decision in the case of \nSykes v. Cleary, the High Court voided the \nelection of Mr Phil Cleary as member of the \nHouse of Representatives for the Division of \nWills. Mr Cleary was disqualified from being \nchosen as a member under section 44(iv) of the \nConstitution on the grounds that, as a Victorian \nstate school teacher on leave without pay, he \nheld an ‘office of profit’ under the Crown. This \ncase has been approved in subsequent High \nCourt applications.\n\nIf you are a Commonwealth, state or territory \npublic servant and wish to nominate for election \nto the Commonwealth Parliament, you should \nresign before nomination in order to comply \nwith the Constitution. Conditions of re-entry \nto the various public services by unsuccessful \ncandidates are matters for the relevant public \nservice authority.\n\nCommonwealth public servants who resign to \ncontest an election and who are unsuccessful \nmay apply for re-appointment or re-engagement \nunder section 32 of the Public Service Act 1999. \nA former officer or former temporary employee \nis required to be re-appointed or re-engaged \nsubject to certain conditions.\n\nMost states and territories have comparable \nstatutory or administrative provisions. The \nposition of local government employees is not \nclear and it might be that such persons are \nvulnerable to the office of profit disqualification. \nSection 327(3) of the Act provides some \nprotection for local government employees who \nbecome, are, or have been candidates. If you are \na local government employee you should check \nwith the relevant authorities before resigning or \nnominating.\n\nThe Constitutional disqualification on the \nground of ‘office of profit’ applies to permanent \nmembers of the Australian Defence Force \n\nCandidates Handbook 2016 \n\n13\n\n\n--- Page 14 ---\n\n(ADF). If you are a member of the ADF you \nshould consult the relevant Defence authority on \nconditions of resignation and re-entry.\n\n‘Foreign allegiance’ disqualification\n\nIn the Sykes v. Cleary decision the High \nCourt also commented on the ‘foreign \nallegiance’ disqualification in section 44(i) of \nthe Constitution. The majority view of the Court \nwas that naturalised Australian citizens who \nalso have foreign citizenship and are standing \nas candidates should take ‘reasonable steps to \nrenounce foreign nationality’. The steps to take \nfor renunciation may depend upon foreign law. \nIf you have foreign citizenship you should check \nwith the relevant embassy or high commission \nabout the procedures for renouncing it.\n\nIn the case of Sue v. Hill in June 1999 the High \nCourt decided that Ms Heather Hill was not duly \nelected as a senator for Queensland at the 1998 \nfederal election because she was disqualified \nunder section 44(i) of the Constitution. Ms Hill \nwas a British subject and an Australian citizen at \nthe time of her nomination. The United Kingdom \nis regarded as a ‘foreign power’ for the purposes \nof section 44(i).\n\nYou are required to sign a declaration on the \nnomination form that you are qualified under the \nConstitution and the laws of the Commonwealth \nto be elected to the Commonwealth Parliament.\n\nIf you have any doubts as to your qualifications \nunder the Constitution, the AEC recommends \nyou seek your own legal advice. The AEC \ndoes not provide legal advice to prospective \ncandidates.\n\nWhen can I nominate?\n\nYou cannot nominate as a candidate until the \nwrit for the election has been issued. The writ is \ndeemed to have been issued at 6pm on the day \non which it is issued. The intention to hold an \nelection is often announced some days before \nthe writ is issued. If you are unsure, check with \nan AEC office or visit the AEC website.\n\nThe date fixed for the close of nominations \nwill be between 10 days and 27 days after the \nissue of the writ and this date is specified in the \nwrit. The AEC advertises the dates from the \nwrit within major newspapers circulating in the \nrelevant state or territory. Also, after the election \nis announced, an election timetable as outlined \nin the writ is published on the AEC website.\n\nYou can nominate as a candidate during \nAEC business hours any time after the writ is \nissued up to 12 noon on the day nominations \nclose. Single nominations for the House of \nRepresentatives must be lodged with the \nrelevant DRO by 12 noon on the day nominations \nclose. Bulk nominations of candidates \nendorsed by a political party for the House \nof Representatives must be lodged with the \nrelevant AEO not less than 48 hours before the \nclose of nominations. All Senate nominations \nmust be lodged with the relevant AEO before the \nclose of nominations.\n\nNominations lodged with another officer or at \nanother place cannot be accepted.\n\nYou are advised to lodge your nomination before \nthe day nominations close. Late nominations \ncannot be accepted under any circumstances.\n\nNomination forms\n\nThere are several different options when \nnominating for the House of Representatives \nor the Senate, each option using a different \nnomination form. You need to complete the \nnomination form for the relevant option, as well \nas an individual candidate details form (Form 59 \nor Form 60) for each candidate nominated.\n\nNote: for elections held on the same day, \nyou can only nominate for one House of \nRepresentatives division, or for the Senate in only \none state or territory. If you nominate more than \nonce all your nominations will be invalid.\n\nBlank nomination forms for the House of \nRepresentatives and the Senate are available \nfrom AEC offices or by phoning the AEC on \n13 23 26. Once the writ for the election has been \nissued, the forms will also be available on the \nAEC website.\n\nCandidates Handbook 2016 \n\n14\n\n\n--- Page 15 ---\n\nIt is against the law to include false or misleading \ninformation in a nomination form. Giving false \nor misleading information is a serious offence. \nIn addition, you must not omit any information if \nomitting that information would be misleading. \nThe maximum penalty for this offence is \nimprisonment for 12 months.\n\nAll nomination papers are publicly produced \nat declaration time (12 noon on the day after \nnominations close) and the relevant AEO or DRO \ndeclares the name and address of candidates \n(address details for a candidate who is a silent \nelector will not be released or declared). All other \ncontact information for candidates, which they \nhave indicated is not for public release, will be \nremoved from a candidate’s form before it is \nproduced at the time of declaration. \n\nInformation listed for public release is also \npublished on the AEC website during the \nelection period.

While the laws relating to ballot \npapers are set out in detail in the Act, there is \nscope for candidates to request certain options \nin relation to their status as either an endorsed \ncandidate or, if unendorsed, whether they want \nthe word ‘Independent’ to appear on the ballot \npaper. If a candidate is endorsed, the party can \nchoose to have the either the party name or \nparty abbreviation appear on the ballot paper. \n\nThis section explains the law as it relates to ballot \npapers and the procedures that determine how \ncandidates, or groups of candidates, are listed \non the ballot paper. It also sets out the time \nframe in which requests can be lodged, such as \na request for a preference order of candidates on \na Senate ballot paper.\n\nBallot paper format\n\nBallot papers show the name of a candidate \nas specified on the nomination form and, if \napplicable, the name or abbreviation of the \nregistered political party that endorsed the \ncandidate and the party’s registered logo.\n\nIf two or more candidates have similar names \nand this is considered likely to cause confusion, \nthe AEC may add an additional description to \ndistinguish them.\n\nHouse of Representatives ballot papers are \ngreen. They have boxes with the names of every \ncandidate and their party name or abbreviation \nor the word ‘Independent’ where applicable \nprinted to the right of the boxes and where \napplicable, the party’s registered logo to the left \nof the box.\n\nVoters must number every box by putting the \nnumber ‘1’ in the box next to the candidate who \nis their first choice, the number ‘2’ in the box \nnext to their second choice, and so on until every \nbox is consecutively numbered.\n\nThe ‘How to make your vote count’ fact sheet \ndemonstrates how electors should complete \nboth the House of Representatives and Senate \nballot papers to ensure their vote counts. In a \nHouse of Representatives only election, voters \nwho reside in states of Australia will receive a \ngreen ballot paper only. Voters in the Australian \nCapital Territory and the Northern Territory will \nreceive both a House of Representatives ballot \npaper and a Senate ballot paper, which is white.\n\nCandidates should carefully consider the \ninformation contained in this fact sheet when \ndeveloping how-to-vote cards.\n\nSenate ballot papers are white. They have two \nparts: an upper section (above the line) and a \nlower section (below the line), separated by a \nthick black line. \n\nA row of boxes above the line is the group voting \nsquare for parties and other Senate groups with \nmore than one candidate. The party names or \nabbreviations of the name of registered parties \nappear above the line on the ballot paper and \nany registered party logos will be printed above \nthe group voting square. The party names or \nabbreviations of the name of registered parties \nwill also appear below each candidate’s name \nbelow the line. \n\nIf an elector chooses to vote above the line, \nthey are instructed to consecutively number at \nleast 6 squares/boxes above the black line, in \nthe order of their preference, commencing with \nthe number ‘1’.

of every candidate and their parties (if \napplicable) or the word ‘Independent’ (for some \nungrouped candidates) printed to the right of \nthe boxes. If an elector chooses to vote below \nthe line, that is, in the lower section, they are \ninstructed to consecutively number at least 12 \nboxes/squares alongside individual candidates \nin order of their preference commencing with the \nnumber ‘1’. They may continue to express further \npreferences if they wish. \n\nPolitical party names and \nlogos on ballot papers\n\nOnly a political party registered with the AEC \ncan have its registered party name or registered \nparty abbreviation and registered logo printed \non the ballot papers next to the names of its \ncandidates. Parties, however constituted, that \nare not registered with the AEC are not entitled \nto have a party name, abbreviation or logo \nprinted next to their candidates’ names on the \nballot paper.\n\nThe request to have a registered party name or \nabbreviation and logo printed on a ballot paper is \nmade on the nomination form. No more than two \nlogos will appear adjacent to their party or group \nname above the line on the Senate ballot paper.\nAlternatively, the registered officer of that party \nmay make the request in writing to the relevant \nAEO or DRO before the close of nominations.\n\nEndorsed House of \nRepresentatives candidates\n\nAn endorsed candidate of a registered political \nparty may have either the registered name or the \nregistered abbreviation and registered logo of \nthat political party printed next to their name on \nthe ballot paper.\n\nOnly one candidate can be endorsed by a \nregistered political party for any House of \nRepresentatives division. If a party attempts \nto endorse more than one candidate all \nnominations for that party in that division will fail.\n\nEndorsed Senate candidates\n\nA group of endorsed Senate candidates of a \nregistered political party may have either the \nregistered name or the registered abbreviation \nand the registered logo of that party printed next \nto their group voting square above the line on the \nballot paper. They may also have the registered \nname or the registered abbreviation next to each \nof the candidates’ names below the line on the \nballot paper.\n\nA composite group of candidates endorsed by \nmore than one registered political party may \nhave a composite name printed next to their \ngroup voting square on the Senate ballot paper. \nEach single endorsed candidate will, however, \nhave their own registered party name or \nregistered abbreviation printed next to their name \nbelow the line on the ballot paper.\n\nIndependent candidates\n\nIf you are not endorsed by a registered political \nparty you may request on the nomination form \nthat the word ‘Independent’ be printed on the \nballot paper next to your name.\n\nIf you do not make this request you will have \nnothing printed next to your name.\n\nGrouped Senate candidates may not use the \nword ‘Independent’ next to their name or next to \nthe group voting square.\n\nOrder of names on ballot \npapers\n\nA system called ‘double randomisation’ – two \nrandom draws – is used for determining the \norder of groups and ungrouped candidates on \nSenate ballot papers and the order of candidates \non House of Representatives ballot papers. \nAll candidates and members of the public are \nwelcome to attend these draws.\n\nCandidates Handbook 2016 \n\n25\n\n\n--- Page 26 ---\n\nThe AEO determines the order of groups and \nungrouped candidates on the ballot paper by \nconducting a public draw for positions. This \ndraw is conducted in two parts, with each part \nconsisting of two draws:\n\n ■ in the first part, the first draw allocates a \n\nnumber to each group and the second draw \ndetermines the order in which the groups \nappear on the ballot paper.\n\n ■ in the second part, the first draw allocates a \n\nnumber to each ungrouped candidate and the \nsecond draw determines the order in which \nungrouped candidates appear on the ballot \npaper.\n\nUngrouped candidates do not have a box above \nthe line on the Senate ballot paper.\n\nHouse of Representatives  \nballot papers\n\nThe DRO declares the House of Representatives \nnominations received for their division at 12 \nnoon, 24 hours after the close of nominations. \nFollowing the declaration the DRO conducts two \ndraws for ballot paper positions.\n\nThe first draw assigns a number to each \ncandidate and the second draw determines the \norder in which candidates appear on the ballot \npaper.\n\nSenate ballot papers\n\nThe AEO declares the nominations received for \nthe Senate in their state or territory at 12 noon, \n24 hours after the nominations close. After the \ndeclaration, the AEO conducts the draws for \npositions on the ballot paper.\n\nIn Senate elections, the names of candidates \nincluded in groups are placed on the ballot paper \nto the left and ahead of the names of candidates \nnot included in groups.\n\nCandidates Handbook 2016 \n\n26\n\n\n--- Page 27 ---\n\nVoting\n\nThe Act\n\nPart XV, ‘Postal voting’\n\nPart XVI, ‘The polling’\n\nFor more information, see voting procedures\n\nHow-to-vote cards\n\nParty workers may assist electors by handing \nthem how-to-vote (HTV) cards and, if necessary, \nexplain the cards to them. Party workers are \nreminded it is an offence to print, publish or \ndistribute misleading or deceptive statements \nrelating to the actual marking of a ballot paper. \nWhen producing HTV material, parties and \ncandidates need to be mindful of the colour and \nsize of their material so as to avoid any confusion \nbetween the HTV material and ballot papers \nissued to electors by the AEC. HTV cards must \ncarry:\n\n ■ the name and full street address of the \n\nauthorising representative.\n\n ■ the political party of the candidate. If the \n\ncandidate is not endorsed by a registered \npolitical party, the name of the candidate and \nthe word ‘candidate’ needs to be included.\n\nA person must not publish a HTV card during an \nelection period unless the name of the registered \npolitical party or candidate on whose behalf the \ncard has been published is clearly printed at \neither the bottom or top of each printed face of \nthe card.\n\nA HTV card is defined in subsection 4(1) of \nthe Act. In short, it is any printed medium that \nlists the name of two or more candidates and \ndirects or encourages electors to mark their \npreference for the candidates in a particular \norder. It does not include a card that only relates \nto first preference votes or only relates to last \npreference votes.\n\nPart XVA, ‘Pre-poll voting’\n\nPart XXI, ‘Electoral offences’\n\nSchedule 2, ‘Grounds of application for postal \nor pre-poll vote’\n\nFollowing recent legislative amendments referred \nto at the beginning of this handbook, there \nhas been some discussion in the media about \nwhether parties, Senate Groups and candidates \ncan advise voters to ‘simply vote one above the \nline’ on the Senate ballot paper. The legislation \nis clear – s.239 of the Act should be read as \ninstructions to voters on how to cast a formal \nvote.\n\nAny HTV card or other electoral advertising \nthat does not reflect the requirements of s.239 \n(for the Senate) or s.240 (for the House of \nRepresentatives) runs the risk of being found by \na court to be in breach of s.329 of the Act.\n\nThere is a general prohibition on canvassing \nwithin six metres of an entrance to a polling \nplace, which means that HTV cards or other \nnon-AEC notices cannot be distributed or \ndisplayed within that distance. HTV cards must \nnot be exhibited or left in a polling place.\n\nAppendix 1 lists the offences under the Act.\n\nHTV cards produced for electors by political \nparties and candidates need to have clear \ninstructions and be well designed so they assist \nelectors to cast a formal vote. Otherwise, HTV \ninformation may confuse some voters and cause \nthem to cast an informal vote without meaning to \ndo so.\n\nHTV cards for electors serviced by mobile polling \nteams may be supplied by party workers to the \nteam leader of a mobile polling team. It is not the \nresponsibility of the team leader to arrange for \nthis or to remind party workers to do so. Mobile \npolling teams will provide the electoral material to \nelectors on request.\n\nCandidates Handbook 2016 \n\n27\n\n\n--- Page 28 ---\n\nElectoral advertising\n\nThe Electoral Backgrounder on Electoral \nAdvertising provides a basic introduction to \nelectoral advertising. Its contents are a guide \nonly. Individual matters are assessed on a case-\nby-case basis and ultimately it is for the courts to \ndecide upon the interpretation of the law in any \nparticular case. Accordingly, if you are in doubt \nabout the interpretation of the law in particular \ncircumstances, you should seek your own \nindependent legal advice.\n\nThe Electoral Backgrounder on Electoral \nAdvertising discusses:\n\n ■ intent of the law\n\n ■ authorisation of electoral advertising\n\n ■ headings to electoral advertisements\n\n ■ electoral advertising on the Internet\n\n ■ misleading and deceptive electoral \n\nadvertisements\n\n ■ second preference how-to-vote cards\n\n ■ truth in political advertising\n\n ■ defamation of candidates\n\n ■ electronic media blackout\n\n ■ political advertising bans\n\n ■ non-compliance, such as electoral advertising \n\noffences\n\n ■ complaints.\n\nCandidates are encouraged to pay particular \nattention to the authorisation of electoral \nadvertising.\n\nCandidates Handbook 2016 \n\n28\n\n\n--- Page 29 ---\n\nElection funding and financial disclosure\n\nThe Act\n\nPart XX, ‘Election funding and financial disclosure’\n\nSome candidates will be eligible to receive \npayment of election funding following a federal \nelection but all candidates are required to \nlodge a compulsory financial disclosure return. \nCandidates can appoint an agent to receive their \nelection funding (if eligible) and complete the \nfinancial disclosure return on their behalf.\n\nThis section gives a brief overview of candidate \nagents and Senate group agents, financial \ndisclosure obligations and payment of election \nfunding.\n\nFurther detailed information on election funding \nand candidate financial disclosure can be \nobtained from the AEC website.\n\nAgents\n\nAppointing an agent\n\nAgent appointment forms are available on the \nappointment of agents page or by contacting  \nthe AEC.\n\nA party agent is not automatically appointed \nas a candidate or Senate group agent unless \nindividually appointed by each endorsed \ncandidate of that party.\n\nIt is your responsibility to ensure that your agent \nappointment form is received by the AEC’s \nNational Office in Canberra before the close of \nnominations. Completed forms can be faxed to \n02 6293 7655, scanned and emailed to  \nfad@aec.gov.au, or sent by post. Postal address \ndetails are available on the forms.\n\nAgent appointment forms should only be sent to \nthe AEC’s National Office, not sent to any other \noffice.\n\nAn agent cannot be appointed if their \nappointment form is received by the AEC’s \nNational Office after the close of nominations. \n\nIn this case, individual candidates will be \nresponsible for completing their own financial \ndisclosure return.\n\nThe appointment is valid for a single election \nonly.\n\nCandidate agents\n\nEach candidate may appoint an agent whether \nor not they are endorsed by a party. Candidates \nwho do not appoint an agent are deemed to be \ntheir own agent.\n\nSenate group agent\n\nSenate groups, the members of which have \nbeen endorsed by a single party, are not \nrequired to appoint an agent for the group \nor lodge a disclosure return. All receipts and \nexpenditure of a Senate group should be \nincluded in the annual return of that party, \nhowever, individual members of such a group \nmay appoint an agent.\n\nAn agent is not the agent of the individual \nmembers of the group unless separately \nappointed as such.\n\nIf no agent is appointed for a Senate group, or \nthe agent appointment form is received by the \nAEC’s National Office in Canberra after the close \nof nominations, the first candidate listed in the \nSenate group is deemed to be the agent.\n\nSenate groups endorsed by more than one \nparty may appoint an agent for the group. If no \nappointment is made the person whose name \nappears first on the ballot paper is deemed to be \nthe agent.\n\nUnendorsed Senate groups can appoint an \nagent for the group. If no appointment is made \nthe person whose name appears first on the \nballot paper is deemed to be the agent for the \ngroup.\n\nCandidates Handbook 2016 \n\n29\n\n\n--- Page 30 ---\n\nEligibility of an agent\n\nTo be eligible for appointment as an agent, the \nnominated person must:\n\n ■ be at least 18 years of age,\n\n ■ not have been convicted of an offence under \nthe funding and disclosure provisions of the \nAct,\n\n ■ have signed a consent to the appointment, \n\nand\n\n ■ have signed a declaration of eligibility for \n\nappointment.\n\nA person may be appointed as the agent for \nmultiple candidates, including a Senate group, \nbut a separate form must be completed for each \nappointment.\n\nElection funding\n\nCandidates who receive four per cent or more of \nthe formal first preference votes in an election are \nentitled to receive election funding. For Senate \ngroups, the group as a whole must receive at \nleast four per cent of the formal first preference \nvotes in their state or territory in order to be \neligible for election funding.\n\nThe amount to be paid is calculated by \nmultiplying the number of formal first preference \nvotes received by the funding rate. The funding \nrate applicable to this election is available on the \nAEC website.\n\nAt least 95 per cent of election funding is paid \nin the fourth week after election day on the \nbasis of votes counted as at the 20th day after \nelection day. The balance is paid when the \ncount is finalised and verified, and when the full \nentitlement is known.\n\nIn the case of independent candidates or Senate \ngroups, payment is made to the agent of the \ncandidate or group. If no agent is appointed, \npayment is made to the candidate or the \nmember of the Senate group placed first in the \ngroup.\n\nIn the case of endorsed candidates and Senate \ngroups, funding is paid to the party agent of the \nendorsing party or parties.\n\nDetailed information about the payment \narrangements for parties endorsing candidates \nor Senate groups can be obtained from the AEC \nwebsite.\n\nFinancial disclosure returns\n\nFollowing an election, candidate and Senate \ngroup agents must lodge financial disclosure \nreturns with the AEC.

This chapter details how the scrutiny \nor count is approached for the House of \nRepresentatives and Senate.\n\nOn election night\n\nThe counting of ordinary votes begins in each \npolling place immediately after the poll closes at \n6pm on election day. Ordinary votes at a polling \nplace are votes cast by electors within their \ndivision on election day. \n\nHouse of Representatives count on \nelection night\n\nBallot papers are initially sorted by the polling \nofficials into first preference votes for each \ncandidate and informal ballot papers. The results \nare then tabulated and the first preference vote \nfigures for each candidate are telephoned to the \nrelevant DRO.\n\nDivisional staff then enter these figures for each \npolling place in their division into the national \ncomputerised Election Management System \nwhich, in turn, updates the Tally Room (TR). The \nTR can be accessed on the AEC website.\n\nIn relation to pre-poll votes cast as ordinary votes \nin the lead up to polling day; \n\nIndicative two-candidate-preferred \n(TCP)\n\n ■ HoR votes will be counted on election night\n\n ■ Senate votes will be counted commencing on \n\nthe Monday after election day.\n\nTally Room\n\nThe AEC hosts a website election results system \nknown as the Tally Room (TR), which provides \nelection information and results in a user-friendly \nformat.\n\nThe TR allows people visiting the website on \nelection night and the weeks following to access \nprogressive House of Representatives results \nand figures from the Senate count for all states \nand territories, together with a comprehensive \nrange of summary and analysis screens. The \nTR produces approximately 1 200 individual \npages of results on election night and more than \n20 000 pages in the post-election period. These \nresults are updated regularly on election night \nand in the post-election period.\n\nOn the completion of the count of first \npreferences for the House of Representatives \nat each polling place, the ARO (or Officer in \nCharge) must, as directed by the relevant AEO (in \naccordance with s.274(2A) of the Act), conduct \nan indicative distribution of preferences on a \ntwo-candidate-preferred (TCP) basis.\n\nThe TCP count shows where preferences \nhave been distributed to the probable final \ntwo candidates in an election. It must be \nremembered that this count is only an indicative \nresult of the election in a division. It is possible \nthat early, absent and mobile votes, counted \nafter election day, could alter the outcome.\n\nThe ballot papers for the two nominated \ncandidates are set aside and the ballot papers \nfor the remaining candidates are distributed to \none of the two nominated candidates according \nto who is more preferred or gets the ‘best \npreference’.\n\nFor example, if the two nominated candidates \nare Labor and Liberal then a ballot paper which \nhas ‘1’ Democrats, ‘2’ Independent, ‘3’ Labor \nand then ‘4’ Liberal will be added to the first \n\nCandidates Handbook 2016 \n\n35\n\n\n--- Page 36 ---\n\npreference figures for the Labor candidate. \nConversely, a ballot paper that showed ‘1’ \nIndependent ‘2’ Liberal (etc.) would be added \nto the first preference figures for the Liberal \ncandidate.\n\nLike the count of first preference votes, this result \nis telephoned through to the DRO, who enters it \ninto the Election Management System. This will \nupdate the TR, which is available on the AEC \nwebsite.\n\nSenate count on election night\n\nOn election night, the ARO counts first \npreference votes on the Senate ballot papers \n– above the line, below the line and the total \nnumber which are obviously informal. A single \nfigure for each group and each ungrouped \ncandidate is reported.\n\nSenate results cannot be calculated until the \nstate or territory-wide total of all votes is known \nand is used to determine the quota – the \nproportion of votes required by a candidate to \nbe elected. It is only possible, therefore, to get \na general impression of the Senate results on \nelection night.\n\nThe Senate count on election night begins at the \nsame time as the TCP count for the House of \nRepresentatives. Results from the Senate count \nare telephoned through to the DRO, and group \ntotals and ungrouped results are entered into the \nElection Management System in the same way \nas House of Representatives votes.\n\nReferendum count on election night\n\nThe counting of referendum ballot papers also \nbegins on election night. The ‘Yes’ and ‘No’ \nvotes are counted, telephoned through to the \nDRO and entered into the Election Management \nSystem.\n\nAfter election night\n\nFresh scrutiny or recheck\n\nThe initial scrutiny conducted at the polling place \non election night is routinely followed by a ‘fresh \nscrutiny’ (HoR and referendum) and DRO Senate \ncount conducted at a divisional out-posted \ncentre in the days following election day. The \nexact time will be advised by the DRO.\n\nAt this stage, some HoR ballot papers earlier \ntreated as informal may be admitted to the \nscrutiny by the DRO, and some ballot papers \noriginally treated as formal may be reclassified as \ninformal.\n\nA full distribution of preferences is conducted in \nevery House of Representatives division, even \nwhere a candidate already has an absolute \nmajority of first preference votes. The result of \nthis full distribution of preferences is used to \ncalculate the two-candidate-preferred statistics.\n\nScrutineers who have been appointed by a \ncandidate for the division may be present \nduring the fresh scrutiny or count. The number \nof scrutineers present is limited to one per \ncandidate for each AEC staff member involved in \nthe count.\n\nSenate scrutiny\n\nAfter the DRO Senate count, the AEO conducts \nthe scrutiny and assesses the formality of Senate \nballot papers at the CSS for the state/territory. \nThe Senate scrutiny and the distribution of \npreferences are conducted using a computer \napplication. The computerised system calculates \nthe quota, distributes preferences and \ndetermines the result of the Senate election.\n\nThis system provides full accountability and an \naudit trail, including reports for inspection by \nscrutineers.\n\nThe relevant AEO notifies all Senate candidates \nby letter of the location and hours of operation of \nthe CSS centre in that state or territory.\n\nCandidates Handbook 2016 \n\n36\n\n\n--- Page 37 ---\n\nDeclaration votes\n\nPostal Votes\n\nDeclaration votes do not get counted on election \nnight; instead, they are counted in the weeks \nfollowing election night. The counting of these \nvotes takes longer than the counting of ordinary \nvotes.\n\nIn the days following election day, a ‘declaration \nvote exchange’ is carried out between the \ndivisions within each state and territory, where \ndeclaration votes are physically passed on to the \nrelevant division. Declaration votes received on \nbehalf of divisions in another state or territory or \noverseas are sent via state or territory offices for \ndistribution to the relevant divisions. Once the \ndeclaration votes are received and processed in \nthe home division, the counting of these votes \ncan begin.\n\nFor federal elections and by-elections, the \nlegislation requires that postal vote envelopes \ncontaining the ballot papers need to be received \nby the appropriate DRO on or before 13 days \nafter election day. These votes are included in \nthe count if:\n\n ■ the vote has been cast before 6pm on election \n\nday\n\n ■ the vote is received by the DRO within 13 days \n\nof election day.\n\nFor this reason, the counting of postal votes is \nan ongoing process for 13 or more days after \nelection day.\n\nCandidates Handbook 2016 \n\n37\n\n\n--- Page 38 ---\n\nRecounts and disputed returns\n\nThe Act\n\nPart XVIII, ‘The scrutiny’\n\nPart XXII, ‘Court of Disputed Returns’\n\nYou, as a candidate, can benefit from a good \nunderstanding of the circumstances and \nprocedures leading to a recount of votes in an \nelection, as well as the circumstances under \nwhich the High Court would sit as a Court of \nDisputed Returns.\n\nAs a candidate you can request a recount \nof ballot papers in an election, however, the \nelectoral official is not automatically obliged to \naccept your request. The official also has the \npower to direct a recount at their discretion \nwithout waiting for a request.\n\nRecounts\n\nThe Act, ss.278 and 279\n\nA recount may be undertaken, approved or \ndirected at any time before the result of an \nelection is declared. It should not be confused \nwith the routine re-check (fresh scrutiny) of the \nHouse of Representatives votes counted on \nelection night.\n\nIn the absence of specifically alleged errors \nit is unlikely that a recount would be required \nat either a House of Representatives election \nor Senate election. However, in the case of a \nHouse of Representatives division, if the margin \nof votes at the completion of the distribution \nof preferences is less than 100, a recount is \nconducted as a matter of course.\n\nGiven the checks and balances in scrutiny \nsystems, significant sorting errors are highly \nunlikely to go undetected.\n\nHouse of  \nRepresentatives recount\n\nIf requesting a recount, House of \nRepresentatives candidates must write to the \nrelevant DRO giving their reasons for the request.\n\nDROs may initiate a recount, or be directed \nby the Electoral Commissioner at any time \nbefore the declaration of a result of a House of \nRepresentatives election to recount all or some \nof the ballot papers.\n\nThe DRO must notify each candidate of the time \nand place of any recount.\n\nThe DRO conducting a recount has the same \npowers as if the recount was the original scrutiny. \nA DRO may reverse any decision in the scrutiny \nto admit or reject a ballot paper.\n\nDuring a recount the DRO may, and at the \nrequest of a scrutineer must, reserve any ballot \npaper for the decision of the AEO. The AEO \nmust decide whether any ballot paper reserved \nfor their decision is to be admitted or rejected. If \na ballot paper is considered as being admitted \nby the AEO, the DRO will determine to whom the \nfirst preference has been allocated.\n\nIf an election result is challenged, the High Court \nof Australia, sitting as the Court of Disputed \nReturns, may consider any ballot paper reserved \nfor the decision of the AEO, but may only order \na further recount if it is satisfied that a recount is \njustified.\n\nCandidates Handbook 2016 \n\n38\n\n\n--- Page 39 ---\n\nEvaluating a request for a House of \nRepresentatives recount\n\nEvaluating a request for  \na Senate Recount\n\nThe general guidelines observed in evaluating \nrequests for a recount are as follows:\n\n ■ A recount may take place where there are \n\nvalid and specific grounds for supposing that \nit could change the result of the election in the \ndivision or where there are specific grounds \nfor determining the need for a recount of \nspecific ballot papers (such as in response to \nspecific allegations or incidents).\n\nThe guidelines for evaluating a request for \na Senate Recount are detailed in the AEC’s \nRecount Policy for Senate Elections.\n\nFor more information on formality, see Ballot \npaper formality guidelines on the AEC website.\n\nCourt of Disputed Returns\n\n ■ A request for a recount which does not \n\nThe Act, Part XXII\n\nplead any valid and specific grounds must \nbe refused. A request for a recount needs to \nidentify specific ballot papers and associated \nsignificant counting process errors or \nirregularities that could change the result of an \nelection within a division.\n\n ■ Wherever possible, the grounds pleaded by \nthe candidate requesting the recount will be \nused to narrow down to as small a category \nas possible the ballot papers that need to be \nre-examined.\n\n ■ Where the margin of votes at the completion \nof the distribution of preferences for a House \nof Representative division is less than 100, \na recount will be undertaken as a matter of \ncourse.\n\n ■ Only one recount of any set of ballot papers \n\nwill occur.\n\n ■ Requests for recounts will only be considered, \n\nand actioned, in the period after the \ncompletion of all scrutinies and before the \ndeclaration of the poll in the division.\n\nSenate recount\n\nIf requesting a recount, Senate candidates must \nwrite to the AEO for the state or territory giving \ntheir reasons for the request.\n\nIf the AEO for the state or territory refuses a \nrequest from a candidate to direct a recount of \nany Senate ballot papers, the candidate may \nappeal in writing to the Electoral Commissioner. \nThe Electoral Commissioner is empowered to \neither direct or refuse a recount.\n\nAnyone contemplating a challenge to an election \nresult should consult their own legal advisers. \nThe validity of the election of any member of \nparliament may only be disputed by a petition \nto the Court of Disputed Returns within 40 \ndays of the return of the writ.

The intent of the Act is:\n\n\tto ensure electors are informed about the \n\nsource of political advertising, and\n\n\tto ensure that political advertising does not \n\nmislead or deceive electors about the way in \nwhich a vote must be cast.\n\nThe AEC therefore has no role or responsibility in \ndeciding whether political messages published \nor broadcast in relation to a federal election \nare true or untrue. The AEC does have a role \nhowever, in doing its best to ensure that electoral \nadvertisements are properly authorised, so that \nelectors can know who is responsible for the \nstatements contained in them.\n\nComplaints must be made in writing, addressed \nto the Deputy Electoral Commissioner, and be \naccompanied by evidence of the material in \nquestion. This could be an original copy of a \nhow-to-vote card, an electoral advertisement \nor other documents relevant to the allegation. \nDepending on the nature of the document \nin question, a scanned copy or an emailed \nphotograph may be acceptable.\n\nThis provides the context for preliminary \nassessment of the matter and also enables \nrelevant evidence to be tendered in court if \nproceedings are undertaken at a later date. \nThe complainant should also provide as much \nadditional information as possible to enable \nassessment of the alleged breach. The AEC \nwill immediately acknowledge receipt of the \ncomplaint.\n\nIf an original copy cannot be obtained, a copy \nof the entire document may be forwarded \nto the AEC. Similarly, for a complaint about \nelectoral advertisements on the Internet, the \ncomplaint should, if possible, be accompanied \nby a print copy of the webpage, showing the \nadvertisement, from which the AEC can make \na formal assessment of its compliance with the \nlaw.\n\nIn the absence of a printed copy of the \nadvertisement as it appeared on the Internet \nbeing provided with the complaint, the AEC will \nrequire enough information about the Internet \nsite in order to locate the advertisement and \nmake an assessment regarding compliance with \nthe Act.\n\nFor more detailed information on the regulation \nof electoral advertisements, you should refer \nto the Electoral Backgrounder on Electoral \nAdvertising, which is available on the AEC \nwebsite or from AEC national and state offices.\n\nPhotographers and media\n\nPhotographers and members of the media or \ntheir equipment must not hinder, inconvenience \nor delay any polling staff or voters. No \nphotographs may be taken of a person recording \na vote that would in any way identify how the \nperson has voted.\n\nAnyone arranging for photographers or media \nto visit polling places should contact the DRO \nin sufficient time to enable arrangements to be \nmade with the officer-in-charge at the relevant \npolling place.\n\nMembers of the media or photographers must \nhave the permission of the DRO before visiting a \npolling place, and they must have the permission \nof the relevant DRO and the institution \nconcerned before visiting any place where \nmobile polling is being conducted.\n\nFor information, including the guidelines on \nmedia coverage in polling places, is available on \nthe AEC website or from AEC national and state \noffices.\n\nCandidates Handbook 2016 \n\n46\n\n\n--- Page 47 ---\n\nAppendix 2:  \nAdditional information available to candidates\n\nThe AEC produces a range of publications \nfor candidates in addition to the Candidates \nHandbook.

Candidates \nwho do not appoint agents become their own \nagents and are responsible for lodging their own \nreturns. The first listed candidate in a Senate \ngroup is responsible for lodging the group’s return \nif an agent has not been appointed for the group. \n\nIn addition to financial disclosure responsibilities, \nthe agents of independent candidates and \nSenate groups (i.e. candidates not endorsed by \npolitical parties) are the persons to whom any \nelection funding entitlements will be paid.\n\nTo appoint an agent, you must complete an \nAgent appointment form and ensure that it \nis received by the AEC’s National Office in \nCanberra before the close of nominations. An \nappointment is valid for a single election only.\n\nAppoint Candidate Agent and Appoint Senate \nGroup Agent forms are available from the \nAEC website.\n\nNote that an agent of a party is not automatically \na candidate’s agent unless specifically appointed \nby the candidate for the election. The exception \nto this is for a Senate group where all the \nmembers of the group have been endorsed by \nthe same registered political party, then the party \nagent is responsible for meeting the disclosure \nobligation of the group in the annual disclosures \nsubmitted for that political party.\n\nFurther information on appointing an agent is \navailable in the Financial Disclosure Guide for \nCandidates and Senate Groups published on \nthe AEC website.\n\nNomination Guide for Candidates \n\n6\n\n\n--- Page 7 ---\n\nWhere to get more \ninformation\n\nFurther information is available in the Candidates \nHandbook and from AEC offices, or by phoning  \n13 23 26.

1918 (CEA).\nThe nomination form will be publicly produced at the time of the declaration of nominations, which takes place 24 hours after nominations close, and may be inspected at any \ntime following the declaration of nominations by members of the public in accordance with the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918.\nNo responsibility will be taken for faxed nominations and no acknowledgement of receipt of faxes will be advised. The form may be sent by fax to the relevant Divisional \nReturning Officer (DRO). No other kind of electronic communication will be accepted. The time of receipt for faxed forms is the time when the message enters the relevant \nAustralian Electoral Commission (AEC) fax machine memory and it is agreed that the AEC is not responsible for any deadlines missed or losses incurred. The deposit cannot be \nlodged electronically, and it is the responsibility of the candidate to ensure that both the fax and the required deposit are received by the DRO before the close of nominations.\nIf a Registered Officer or a Deputy Registered Officer nominates a party’s endorsed candidates for the House of Representatives to the Australian Electoral Officer (AEO), no \nnomination of any other candidates endorsed by that party should be made to a DRO within that State or Territory. If a nomination for another candidate endorsed by the same \nparty is lodged with a DRO all the party’s nominations made to the AEO under section 167(3) of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 will be rejected (section 172 CEA).\nIf your party has a logo entered in the Register of Political Parties at the time of nomination, you may request to have that logo printed adjacent to the candidate’s name on the \nballot paper. \nFor further information, please refer to the AEC website at www.aec.gov.au or call 13 23 26. \nGiving false or misleading information is a serious offence.\n\nAECEF060-bAustralian Electoral Commission 290416 EF060-b\n\n\n\n--- Page 1 ---\n\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 1 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 2 ---\n\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 1 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 2 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 3 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 4 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 5 ---\n\n\n\nProvide only the markdown formatted summary text.
