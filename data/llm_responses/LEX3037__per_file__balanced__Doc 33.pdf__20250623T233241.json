It confirms that TikTok reviewed an AEC report regarding an \"AEC Impersonation Referral\" and subsequently removed the violating account for breaching its community guidelines.\n\nThis email is highly relevant to FOI request LEX3037 as it directly exemplifies the AEC's proactive engagement with major tech companies, specifically TikTok, concerning the 2022 federal election. It demonstrates the \"direct communication channels and content referrals\" used by the AEC's Electoral Integrity Assurance Taskforce to identify and address \"non-compliant content\" (in this case, impersonation) to safeguard election integrity. The swift action by TikTok underscores the collaborative efforts described in the FOI request overview."
