            "text": "### Summary of Document and Relevance to FOI Request LEX3177\n\nThis document is a submission from the applicant for internal review on behalf of the Seniors United Party of Australia (SUPA), dated March 25, 2021. It provides additional arguments supporting SUPA's request to set aside the decision to deregister the party and instead re-register it. The submission contends that the party's predominantly elderly, pensioner-majority demographic creates unique financial disadvantages. Specifically, it highlights that members' lack of taxable income reduces the party's donation revenue (as donations cannot be claimed back through tax) and limits funds for communication and staffing. It also notes difficulties in finding financially viable candidates from their demographic.\n\n**Relevance to FOI Request:** This document is directly relevant to FOI request LEX3177 as it details specific \"claims of unfairness\" raised by SUPA against the Australian Electoral Commission's (AEC) membership testing methodology. These arguments, focusing on demographic-induced financial constraints, directly challenge the \"fairness and practicality\" of the AEC's approach as applied to parties with unique membership profiles. The AEC's \"Commission Paper – Review of the delegate’s decision to deregister the Senior United Party of Australia\" (17 Nov 2021), a primary document for this FOI, would have systematically addressed these very arguments to demonstrate the methodology's consistent application, impartiality, and adherence to the principles of rationality, fairness, and practicality, thereby substantiating the AEC's conclusion."

  "prompt": "Considering this document as part of an FOI request, summarize the document and its relevance to the FOI request in markdown format. Provide only the markdown formatted summary text. Do not include any conversational filler or preamble.To aid you, the overview of the FOI request is: [REQUEST OVERVIEW START] This FOI request (LEX3177) sought documents supporting the Australian Electoral Commission's (AEC) conclusion that its membership testing methodology was \"rational, fair and practical.\" The primary released document, the \"Commission Paper – Review of the delegate’s decision to deregister the Senior United Party of Australia\" (17 Nov 2021), details the AEC's methodology, developed by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) and re-endorsed in 2017, as the foundation for its appropriateness. The paper outlines three membership testing rounds for the Seniors United Party of Australia (SUPA), with initial tests in October 2020 and February 2021 failing to meet the 500-member threshold, leading to deregistration. However, a September 2021 test, conducted during an internal review, successfully verified SUPA's membership, leading to the party's re-registration. The paper also systematically addresses SUPA's claims of unfairness (e.g., due to demographics, alleged errors, lack of scrutineers), asserting the methodology's consistent application, impartiality, and focus on formal membership, thus demonstrating its adherence to the principles of rationality, fairness, and practicality.\n [REQUEST OVERVIEW END] \n\n--- MAIN DOCUMENT TEXT START ---\n\n\n\n--- Page 1 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 2 ---\n\n25th March 2021 \n\nCommission Secretariat \nAustralian Electoral Commissioner, \nLocked Bag 4007, \nCANBERRA \nACT 2601 \ncommission.secretariat@aec.gov.au \nAEC 02 6271 4552 \n\nRequest to provide further material in support of reasons  already supplied for \nmaking an Application for Internal Review \n\n of decision to Deregister \n\nthe SENIORS UNITED PARTY OF AUSTRALIA \n\nunder s 141(2) of the Electoral Act \n\nDear Sir / Madam, \n\nI have given the following details in my Application for a Review which has already been received \nby the Australian Electoral Commission. \n\n and I am the applicant for this review. I am a person affected   \nMy name is \nby, and dissatisfied with, the decision by the Australian Electoral Commission to deregister the \n Seniors United Party of Australia, ( SUPA).  \n\nconsider the reasons below which I feel give a strong argument for the AEC to set aside the \ndecision under review and make a decision in substitution for the decision set aside. That is, to \n reregister the party. \n\n I ask you to please \n\nThe two reasons I wish to add for the AEC to consider are:- \n\nOTHER DEMOGRAPHIC  REASONS \n\nBecause of the demographic which the party attempts to represent, that is over 60 years of age, our \nmainly elderly membership is largely made up of aged pensioners, or part pensions. \n\n4.  Being a pensioner, or part pensioner usually implies that you pay no income tax. Paying no \n      income tax means that any donation given to the Seniors United party by party members \n      who are pensioners can not be claimed on income tax because they have no income tax to \n\nOut of scopeOut of scopeOut of scopeOut of scope\n\n\n--- Page 3 ---\n\npay. The result of this is that the party’s income from donations is sharply reduced compared to \n     most, if not every other political party  (There is no other funding besides donations). This lack \n     of funds is a hug disadvantage for the party as there is little to no funds for communicating by \n     mail to many members let alone advertising, and there is no possibility of employing people to \n     carry what might be regarded as office work. \n\n     Other parties, especially the major parties receive many large donations most of which would be \n      claimed back through tax by the donor. \n\n5.  An additional disadvantage of having a large part of the membership being pensioners or part \n     pensioners is that they individually normally do not have financial funds to be able to afford \n     to be political candidates at elections hence there are difficulties finding candidates with life \n     experiences of being a pensioner in a financial position to stand as a candidate \n\nREQUEST \n\nI wish these two additional reasons please be be included with the initial reasons and   I \nrespectfully ask the AEC Commission to please consider all my reasons and set aside the failed \ndecision for the Seniors United Party of Australia and substitute it with a pass decision. \n\nThanking you for this review. \n\nYours Faithfully, \n\nOut of scope\n\n"
