            "text": "The provided FOI documents reveal a multi-layered failure demonstrating incompetence, a lack of transparency, and alarming allegations of systemic bias within a critical independent institution.\n\nFirstly, the FOI process itself is a scandalous display of disarray. Despite explicitly listing a \"Letter to Cash/Dutton\" for \"Release in full\" with \"N/A\" for exemptions, this crucial document is conspicuously absent. This constitutes an egregious failure to comply with basic FOI obligations, raising immediate suspicions of either profound administrative incompetence or a deliberate, cynical act of information withholding. The vague titling (\"Letter to Electoral Commissioner\", \"Letter to Cash/Dutton\") further suggests a system designed for obfuscation rather than clarity.\n\nSecondly, the sole provided document—a letter from Opposition Leader Peter Dutton and Shadow Minister Michaelia Cash to the Electoral Commissioner—unveils damning allegations against the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC), an institution ostensibly mandated to ensure fair and impartial elections. The letter exposes an alleged \"fundamentally lopsided\" and discriminatory approach to counting referendum votes. The AEC's policy, as detailed in its Scrutineers Handbook, shockingly deems a 'tick' as a formal 'yes' vote while simultaneously classifying a 'cross' as ambiguous and thus informal.\n\nThis discriminatory practice is not merely an administrative oversight; it is presented as a direct mechanism to \"artificially skew the count towards the yes vote,\" thereby \"distorting the national vote\" and undermining the democratic process itself. The opposition's accusation that this gives the 'yes' case an \"unfair advantage\" strongly implies a deliberate or negligent partisan bias within the AEC.\n\nThe AEC's purported justification—reliance on past practice and undisclosed legal advice from the Attorney-General's Department—is ruthlessly exposed as inadequate and opaque. The opposition correctly asserts that past practice does not equate to legality or fairness, suggesting the AEC is either blindly adhering to flawed procedures or intentionally maintaining a biased system. The refusal to release the legal advice, despite claims of waived privilege, highlights a shocking lack of transparency and fuels suspicions of a cover-up, implying the advice may not withstand public scrutiny or could reveal further systemic issues.\n\nIn summary, these documents paint a picture of an FOI system in chaos and an electoral commission facing grave, credible accusations of subverting democratic fairness through a discriminatory counting policy. This dual failure—information withheld and an independent body accused of partisan manipulation—demands immediate and thorough investigation into what appears to be either profound incompetence or a malicious intent to influence the outcome of a national referendum."

The handbook indicates that while a tick will likely be \ntreated by the AEC as a ‘yes’ vote, a cross on its own is considered by the AEC to \nbe ambiguous, and therefore will be treated as informal. \n\nWith the greatest of respect, this approach is fundamentally lopsided. It risks \ndistorting the national vote. \n\nAustralians expect the AEC to act fairly and impartially in the execution of its duties. \nCounting a tick as a formal vote while simultaneously excluding a cross as informal \ncould artificially skew the count towards the yes vote, and fail to accurately reflect the \nwill of the Australian people.\n\n\n--- Page 2 ---\n\nWe understand that the AEC’s current approach is broadly consistent with the \napproach that it has adopted in previous referendums. However, just because the \nAEC has adopted this approach before, does not mean that it is appropriate or \nlegally correct.  \n\nGiven the AEC’s purported reliance on legal advice from the Attorney-General’s \nDepartment in reaching this view, the AEC should release this advice so the \nAustralian public can properly consider the AEC’s position. We note that any legal \nprofessional privilege that existed in the legal advice has clearly been waived by the \nAEC through its public statements about the advice over many years.  \n\nMore importantly, we call on you to reconsider the AEC’s approach. If a tick counts \nfor yes, a cross should count for no. To do otherwise gives the yes case an unfair \nadvantage, and has the potential to undermine the impartiality and fairness of the \nreferendum. \n\nIt is, after all, in the interests of every Australian to ensure that this basic standard of \nfairness is applied. \n\nYours sincerely \n\nPETER DUTTON \n\nMICHAELIA CASH \n\n24 August 2023\n\n\n\n--- Page 1 ---\n\n\n\n\n--- Page 2 ---\n\n\n\nProvide only the markdown formatted summary text.
