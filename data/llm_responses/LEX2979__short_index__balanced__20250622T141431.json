The released document, \"ABS Advice to AEC on sampling methodology,\" details the statistical approach recommended to the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) to assure high confidence in the accuracy of ballot scanning and data extraction, primarily targeting \"Stage 2 errors.\" It specifies varying sampling rates per state/territory (e.g., 1 in 3,000 in NSW, 1 in 120 in NT), aiming for 99% confidence that the national error rate is low (e.g., less than 6.5 errors per 1,000 ballot papers). The methodology, deemed more efficient than previous approaches, uses a \"clustered sampling\" technique, selecting bundles of ballots and then individual ballots within them, and provides guidance for calculating the national error rate while also discussing alternative options considered."

  "prompt": "Create a concise, single-paragraph summary in markdown format of the following FOI request summary:\n\nSummary:\n\n## FOI Request Summary: LEX2979 - Senate Ballot Paper Sampling Methodology\n\n### Main Purpose of the FOI Request\n\nThe FOI request, identified as LEX2979, sought to obtain the specific document detailing the methodology for the ballot paper sampling process used in the audit of Senate ballot papers. It specifically requested the \"advice from the Australian Bureau of Statistics\" (ABS) and their \"guidance for calculating, analysing and reporting the statistical conclusions that can be drawn,\" explicitly excluding any general process outlines already published by the AEC.\n\n### Documents from the FOI Request\n\nThe request resulted in the release of one document:\n*   **\"ABS Advice to AEC on sampling methodology\"**\n\n### Main Content from the FOI Request Documents\n\nThe released document, \"ABS Advice to AEC on sampling methodology,\" outlines the statistical methodology recommended by the ABS to the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) for assuring the accuracy of Senate ballot paper processing.\n\nKey content includes:\n\n*   **Objective:** To determine the optimal number of ballots to manually check to ensure a high level of confidence that the national error rate in the Senate ballot scanning and data extraction process is low. The primary focus is on \"Stage 2 errors\" (matching scanned images to extracted data), given that \"Stage 1 errors\" (scanned images matching physical ballots) were found to be negligible in previous audits.\n*   **Recommended Sampling Rates:** The ABS recommends specific assurance rates per state/territory for Stage 2 testing, which vary based on the estimated number of Senate forms. Examples include:\n    *   1 in 3,000 ballots in New South Wales and Victoria.\n    *   1 in 120 ballots in the Northern Territory.\n    *   This approach is estimated to involve checking 9,895 ballots nationally for the 2021/22 Senate election.\n*   **Confidence Targets:** The methodology aims to achieve 99% confidence that the observed error rate in the sample for each state will be less than 1%, assuming a true population error rate of 0.45% (derived from the 2019 assurance). This translates to a 99% confidence that the national error rate is less than 6.5 errors per 1,000 ballot papers and less than 10 errors per 1,000 in any given state.\n*   **Efficiency Improvements:** The proposed methodology is noted to be more efficient than the 2019 internal AEC approach, requiring fewer total ballots for assurance while providing higher confidence in the national error rate. It also allows assurance to occur concurrently with ongoing ballot processing.\n*   **Practical Implementation:** The document details a \"clustered sampling\" approach for practical implementation. This involves:\n    *   Selecting a proportion of ballot \"bundles\" (each containing 50 ballots) at a constant rate per state (e.g., 1 in every 300 bundles in NSW).\n    *   Then, selecting 1 in 10 of the ballots within the chosen bundles for Stage 2 testing.\n    *   Subsequently, selecting 1 in 10 of the Stage 2 sample for Stage 1 testing.\n*   **National Error Rate Calculation:** Guidance is provided on how to calculate the national error rate when different sampling rates are applied across states, emphasizing the need to weight state-level errors by their proportion of the national population.\n*   **Alternate Options Considered:** The document also discusses alternative sampling allocation strategies that were evaluated (e.g., constant national sample rate, maximum state margin of error constraint), explaining the rationale for selecting the final recommended approach for its robustness and practical benefits.\n\nIn essence, the released document provides the comprehensive statistical and practical guide developed by the ABS for the AEC's Senate ballot paper assurance process, detailing sample sizes, confidence levels, and implementation methods.\n\nProvide only the markdown formatted summary text. Do not include any conversational filler or preamble."
