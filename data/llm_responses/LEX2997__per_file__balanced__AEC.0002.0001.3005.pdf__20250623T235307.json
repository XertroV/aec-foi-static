Key attendees include Tom Rogers (Electoral Commissioner). The subject notes \"ELT papers + teams invite,\" and specifically highlights that \"Agenda item 06f) OPC update paper\" will be circulated.\n\nThis document is relevant to the FOI request as it indicates high-level internal AEC discussion regarding compliance matters. The \"OPC update paper\" likely refers to an update from the Office of Political Communications or a similar unit responsible for investigating electoral communication compliance, aligning with the ongoing AEC investigation into Andrew Laming MP's Facebook pages for breaches of federal electoral authorisation laws. The meeting date (May 2021) falls within the timeframe of the active investigation, suggesting the Laming case or related broader compliance issues were a topic of executive-level review."

Do not include any conversational filler or preamble.To aid you, the overview of the FOI request is: [REQUEST OVERVIEW START] The FOI request disclosed documents detailing the Australian Electoral Commission's (AEC) investigation into Andrew Laming MP's Facebook pages for compliance with federal electoral authorisation laws. This inquiry was triggered by public complaints and media reports, notably from *The Guardian*, alleging Laming used numerous pages (e.g., \"Redland Bay Bulletin,\" \"Redlands Institute\") disguised as community or news groups to promote political content and attack opponents without mandatory disclosures. The AEC confirmed an active investigation, noting 2018 Electoral Act amendments broadened social media authorisation, and issued formal notices to Laming for detailed information and to third parties (like Facebook) for data, with Facebook confirming its cooperation. Findings revealed some pages were removed or updated with authorisation, while others remained active and unauthorised.\n [REQUEST OVERVIEW END] \n\n--- MAIN DOCUMENT TEXT START ---\n\n\n\n--- Page 1 ---\n\nAEC.0002.0001.3005\n\nOrganiser: Terri ThomasSubject: ELT papers + teams invite [SEC=OFFICIAL]Required: Tim Courtney; Tom Rogers; Lynn White; Jeff Pope; Holly Castro; Thomas RyanLocation: TEAMSStart time: 3 May 2021 16:00:00 +1000End time: 3 May 2021 17:30:00 +1000Please note that Agenda item 06f) OPC update paper will be with you first thing Monday morning.________________________________________________________________________________Microsoft Teams meetingJoin on your computer or mobile appClick here to join the meeting<https://teams.microsoft.com/l/meetup-join/19%3ameeting_YjdhNWUyMDUtZDliMi00Mzc2LTk4ZjgtODgxOGMxMDQ5ZGM5%40thread.v2/0?context=%7b%22Tid%22%3a%22c1eefc4f-a78a-4616-a218-48ba01757af3%22%2c%22Oid%22%3a%22df8ad216-d4fb-4c29-a3ac-510d5c1b1bb8%22%7d>[https://www.aec.gov.au/_template/css/img/aec-logo-homepage.png]This meeting invitation was generated by the AEC Microsoft Teams instanceLearn More<https://aka.ms/JoinTeamsMeeting> | Meeting options<https://teams.microsoft.com/meetingOptions/?organizerId=df8ad216-d4fb-4c29-a3ac-510d5c1b1bb8&tenantId=c1eefc4f-a78a-4616-a218-48ba01757af3&threadId=19_meeting_YjdhNWUyMDUtZDliMi00Mzc2LTk4ZjgtODgxOGMxMDQ5ZGM5@thread.v2&messageId=0&language=en-US>________________________________________________________________________________\n\n"
