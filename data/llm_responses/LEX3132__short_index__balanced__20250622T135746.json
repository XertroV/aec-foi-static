Documents released included a March 2, 2022, email chain where Assistant Commissioner Joanne Reid instructed the testing of the Party's new 4,680-name membership list (top 1,650 names) to verify their claims, following an earlier failed membership test. A subsequent March 21, 2022, Minute confirmed this assessment was undertaken using ABS methodology, concluding that VOTEFLUX.ORG failed to demonstrate the requisite 1,500 members, and recommended their deregistration based on these findings."

(the Party)\" dated March 21, 2022.\n    2.  **Email chain:** \"Re: Delegate consideration – s 137 response received – VOTEFLUX.ORG | Upgrade Democracy!\" dated March 2, 2022.\n\n*   **Main Content Related to the FOI Request:**\n    *   The **email chain** (March 2, 2022) directly addresses the evaluation of VOTEFLUX.ORG's February 13, 2022, response. Joanne Reid, Assistant Commissioner and delegate, acknowledged receipt and consideration of the Party's statement and new membership list (containing 4,680 names). Crucially, she explicitly instructed that this new membership list \"needs to be tested\" by selecting the \"top 1,650 names for testing to conform with our testing methodology parameters\" before she could make a determination on deregistration. This confirms an active attempt to evaluate the Party's new statistical claims. The email chain also provides background, noting the Party had previously failed a membership test in December 2021, which prompted the initial deregistration notice under s 137.\n    *   The **Minute** (March 21, 2022), dated after the delegate's instruction for further testing, confirms that an \"assessment of the Party’s membership list was undertaken\" based on the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) methodology. The minute states that this assessment \"demonstrated that the Party has failed to demonstrate to have at least 1,500 members.\" Based on this evaluation of the statistical claims, the minute recommends to the delegate that there are \"reasonable grounds\" to deregister the Party.\n\nProvide only the markdown formatted summary text. Do not include any conversational filler or preamble."
