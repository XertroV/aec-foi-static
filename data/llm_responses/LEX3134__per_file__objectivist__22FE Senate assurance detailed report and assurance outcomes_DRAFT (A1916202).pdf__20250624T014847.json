            "text": "This document, \"External statistical assurance of the Senate ballot papers,\" details the Australian Electoral Commission's (AEC) process for statistically auditing the accuracy of its ballot paper scanning and digitization, undertaken by Axiom Associates with guidance from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS). Its stated purpose is to assure that electronic data reflects physical ballot papers, as required by legislation.\n\nFrom an Objectivist perspective, this document largely **contradicts** the values of reason, individualism, and free enterprise, while providing evidence of bureaucratic obstacles and suppression of productive achievement, aligning precisely with the critique outlined in the FOI request overview.\n\n**Contradictions to Reason:**\nThe document reveals a fundamental disregard for objective truth in favor of bureaucratic interpretation and statistical approximation. The assurance process, as stated in 1.10, was \"not designed to conclude on the completeness of the number of physical or electronic ballot papers or the accuracy of the count,\" but rather focuses narrowly on whether preferences were \"accurately reflected.\" This immediately dismisses a crucial aspect of objective truth in an election. Furthermore, the reliance on \"interpretation of voter intent aligned with AEC business rules\" (1.20, 1.30) and the subsequent review by \"three experienced AEC officers\" (1.31) who \"independently ‘blind test’\" and arrive at a consensus for an \"exception\" (1.32) is a direct rejection of objective reality. Voter intent, when unclear, should ideally be resolved by seeking objective evidence, or the vote marked as informal, not by subjective bureaucratic consensus. The document itself admits \"inconsistent application of the AEC’s business rules, by either Fujifilm or AEC officers\" (2.5) as a source of exceptions, demonstrating a failure of rational, consistent application of even their own rules. The acceptance of a \"0.45% exception rate in the assurance sample\" (2.8), with a 95% confidence interval implying up to 89,076 potentially mishandled votes nationally (Table 4), prioritizes a statistical \"assurance\" over the rational demand for absolute accuracy for *every* individual vote.\n\n**Contradictions to Individualism:**\nThe document directly showcases the infringement on individual rights. The category \"voter disenfranchised where a vote was recorded as informal when the voter expressed a valid preference(s)\" (1.22, 2.4) is a concrete instance of the individual's political expression being suppressed by bureaucratic process. The AEC's \"interpretation of voter intent\" through subjective \"business rules\" rather than respecting clear individual choice (1.20, 1.30) underscores a collectivist approach where the individual's will is subordinate to the system's arbitrary dictates. The entire system's focus on \"statistical assurance\" of the aggregate count (2.7, 2.8) implicitly sacrifices the precision of individual votes for the perceived \"integrity\" of the collective outcome, revealing a lack of accountability to the individual citizen.\n\n**Contradictions to Free Enterprise:**\nAs a \"monopolistic, taxpayer-funded bureaucracy,\" the AEC's operation, even when engaging external contractors like Axiom Associates, inherently lacks the efficiency, innovation, and accountability fostered by free enterprise. The document details a process dictated by \"AEC business rules\" and \"legislative context\" (1.1, 1.20, 1.30), demonstrating the \"stifling personal initiative and productive achievement by demanding conformity to arbitrary 'business rules'\" (FOI request overview). There is no market mechanism to drive continuous improvement or competition for superior accuracy in vote processing. The reliance on \"statistical assurances\" rather than a pursuit of zero-defect perfection, which a competitive market might demand, reflects the inefficiencies inherent in centralized control.\n\n**Evidence of Bureaucratic Obstacles, Forced Altruism, or Suppression of Productive Achievement:**\n*   **Bureaucratic Obstacles:** The document explicitly notes \"unplanned staff absences in the Northern Territory CSS location\" and \"late notification of some changes to scanning shifts\" (1.16, 1.17) as leading to deviations from methodology. The need for \"Axiom staff\" to intervene remotely or on-site to resolve \"complex potential exceptions\" (1.26) highlights the operational challenges within the AEC's centralized system. The admission of \"inconsistent application of the AEC’s business rules\" (2.5) by staff (both AEC and Fujifilm contractors) points to systemic human error and lack of precise, objective standards.\n*   **Forced Altruism:** While not explicitly stated as such, the very nature of a taxpayer-funded election bureaucracy, as critiqued by Objectivism, operates on forced altruism: individuals are compelled via taxation to fund a collective service, regardless of their specific consent or the quality of its delivery. The statistical \"acceptable\" error rate implies a collective tolerance for individual disenfranchisement for the sake of the overall (imperfect) system.\n*   **Suppression of Productive Achievement:** The document describes a process driven by \"business rules\" and \"agreed methodology\" (1.6, 1.7), which, while aiming for consistency, inherently stifles innovation and individual initiative that could lead to more accurate or efficient vote counting methods. The acceptance of a non-zero error rate (0.45%), even with statistical confidence, signifies a lower standard of productive achievement than what could be driven by competitive pressure and a demand for absolute individual vote accuracy. The detailed categorization of errors (Table 3) stemming from \"interpretation where voters did not follow numbering instructions\" (2.6) suggests a system designed for bureaucratic convenience rather than maximizing voter autonomy through intuitive design or error correction, thereby suppressing the productive achievement of a truly democratic, accurate vote."

Analyze how the document reflects or contradicts the values of reason, individualism, and free enterprise. Note any evidence of bureaucratic obstacles, forced altruism, or suppression of productive achievement.\n\nTo aid you, the overview of the FOI request is: [REQUEST OVERVIEW START] The Australian Electoral Commission's ballot scanning and digitisation process, as detailed in recent FOI documents, exemplifies the inherent failures of government overreach and collectivism, directly infringing upon individual rights and undermining rational self-interest. The documented 0.45% national exception rate and the \"voter disenfranchised\" category constitute a direct assault on the individual's right to have their political expression precisely recorded, revealing a system that prioritizes bureaucratic convenience over objective truth. Furthermore, the AEC's \"interpretation of voter intent\" through subjective, collective consensus among officers, rather than respecting clear individual choice, is a dangerous rejection of reason and personal autonomy. This monopolistic, taxpayer-funded bureaucracy demonstrates the inefficiency inherent in centralized control, stifling personal initiative and productive achievement by demanding conformity to arbitrary \"business rules\" and imposing convoluted \"statistical assurances\" that betray a fundamental lack of accountability to the individual citizen and a disregard for the absolute accuracy crucial to a free society.\n [REQUEST OVERVIEW END] \n\n--- MAIN DOCUMENT TEXT START ---\n\n\n\n--- Page 1 ---\n\nExternal statistical assurance \nof the Senate ballot papers \n\nDetailed report and statement \nof outcomes (draft) \n\nAustralian Electoral Commission \nJuly 2022\n\n\n--- Page 2 ---\n\nAustralian Electoral Commission | July 2022 \n\nContents \n\n1.

STATISTICAL ASSURANCE ACTIVITIES PERFORMED  \n\nLEGISLATIVE CONTEXT FOR BALLOT PAPER ASSURANCE  \n\nThe Electoral Legislation Amendment (Assurance of Senate Counting) Act 2021 (the Act) sets out the \n1.1 \nrequirements  for  ballot  paper  sampling  assurance  throughout  computerised  scrutiny  of  votes  in  Senate \nelection.  \n\n1.2 \nSection 273AC requires the Electoral Commissioner to arrange for statistically significant samples of \nballot papers to be checked throughout the scrutiny of votes for the election to assure that the electronic data \nused in counting the votes reflects the data recorded on the ballot papers.  \n\nThe ballot paper sampling  process is not part of the scrutiny in relation to the election.1 The ballot \n1.3 \npaper sampling process may be inspected by the scrutineers at the counting centre where the scrutiny is being \nconducted.2  \n\n1.4 \nBefore  the  polling  day  for  the  election,  the  Electoral  Commissioner  must  publish  on  the  Electoral \nCommission’s website: a methodology to be used for the ballot paper sampling process; and the process to be \nused for reconciling preferences.3  \n\n1.5  Within 14 days after the return of the writ for the election, the Electoral Commissioner must publish \non  the  Electoral  Commission’s  website  a  statement  setting  out  the  outcomes of  the  ballot  paper  sampling \nprocess.4  \n\nASSURANCE PROCESSES UNDERTAKEN  \n\nOn  16  May  2022,  the  Australian  Electoral  Commission  (AEC)  approved  the  methodology  and \n1.6 \noperational approach that would be used to deliver the external statistical assurance of the 2022 Senate ballot \npapers. The assurance process would consist of five components: sample selection, assurance testing, quality \nassurance, AEC review of potential exceptions and report creation.  \n\n1.7 \nThe following sections outline how the approved methodology was implemented for the 2022 Senate \nballot paper assurance activities and any deviations from the agreed methodology. It also details any risks of \nthese deviations to the statistical assurance outcomes.  \n\nSAMPLE SELECTION \n1.8 \nAEC determined that sample selection must occur at the Central Senate Scrutiny (CSS) centres in each \nstate and territory. A physical ballot paper was at the CSS and this was compared to the electronic data used by \nthe AEC in the counting of the votes (preference data recorded in AEC’s Ballot Paper Reconciliation System \n(BPRS)). \n\nThis approach to sample selection was based on the flow of ‘physical ballot paper to electronic data \n1.9 \nrecord’. As a result, the assurance was designed to conclude on whether, for each ballot paper tested, there \nwere matching electronic data used in counting the votes.  \n\nThe  assurance  was  not  designed  to  conclude  on  the  completeness  of  the  number  of  physical  or \n1.10 \nelectronic ballot papers or the accuracy of the count. The approach to assurance testing was not designed to \n\n1 Subsection 273AC(4) of the Electoral Legislation Amendment (Assurance of Senate Counting) Act 2021. \n2 Subsection 273AC(5) of the Electoral Legislation Amendment (Assurance of Senate Counting) Act 2021. \n3 Subsection 273AC(6) of the Electoral Legislation Amendment (Assurance of Senate Counting) Act 2021. \n4 Subsection 273AC(7) of the Electoral Legislation Amendment (Assurance of Senate Counting) Act 2021. \n\n  External statistical assurance of the Senate ballot papers \n\n1\n\n\n--- Page 4 ---\n\nAustralian Electoral Commission | July 2022 \n\ndetect if there were electronic data records held by the AEC that were not associated with a physical ballot \npaper or whether there were multiple electronic data records associated with a single physical ballot paper.  \n\nThe risk of the introduction of additional electronic records and data into AEC systems is the subject of \n1.11 \nthe requirements of section 273AA of the Act related to assurance of security of computer systems for scrutiny \nof votes in Senate election. This is to be reported separately by the Electoral Commissioner.  \n\nIn November 2021, the AEC received advice from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) to determine \n1.12 \nthe number of ballot papers to be selected for statistical assurance purposes.5 This advice identified the number \nof ballot papers nationally to be selected to provide statistical assurance and the breakdown of the number of \nballot papers to be selected in each CSS state and territory location. The ballot paper assurance process used \nthe  sample  sizes  identified  by  the  ABS.  In  all  CSS  state  and  territory  locations,  the  assurance  process \noversampled  ballot  papers  by  a  small  number  to  allow  for  any  contingencies  such  as  where  a  batch  was \nrescanned after testing.  \n\n1.13 \n\nThe sample sizes are summarised in Table 1.  \n\nTable 1: Ballot paper assurance process sample sizes \n\nCSS state and territory \nlocation\n\nABS ballot paper sample \nsize a\n\nActual ballot paper sample \nsize in 2022\n\nNSW\nVIC\nQLD\nWA\nSA \nTAS\nACT\nNT\nTotal national sample size\nNote a: ABS advice to AEC on sampling methodology, November 2021 \n\n1,733\n1,377\n1,272\n1,272\n1,200\n1,106\n977\n958\n9,895\n\n1,735\n1,400\n1,310\n1,285\n1,245\n1,135\n1,028\n965\n10,103\n\n1.14 \nThe  ABS  also  identified  that  cluster  sampling  of  ballot  papers  would  assist  with  the  practical \nimplementation of the assurance process. The approach to cluster sampling would allow the AEC to test five \nballot papers from a single batch of 50 ballot papers. This approach was used to reduce the number of batches \nof ballot papers to be subject to assurance testing.  \n\nIn  each  CSS  state  and  territory  location  the  sample  was  selected  throughout  the  scanning  process. \n1.15 \nSample selection was based on schedules of extraction times to select ballot paper transport containers (BPTCs) \nwhich had just been scanned. The sampling approach was to use the first batch in each of these selected BPTCs \nand to test five ballot papers in that batch. BPTCs were not tested until BPRS indicated that the status of the \nBPTC was ‘confirmed’, indicating that data had been transmitted and reconciled by the AEC.  \n\n1.16 \nThe extraction  schedules  were  developed by Axiom to align to  the proposed Fujifilm scanning shift \nschedules provided to the AEC prior to the election. These sampling extraction schedules were updated during \nthe course of scanning to reflect changes in the Fujifilm scanning shift schedules. Due to the late notification of \nsome changes to scanning shifts (not scanning on some planned days, shorter shifts and extended shifts), the \nsampling extraction schedules were not fully aligned to Fujifilm scanning shifts and extractions could not always \n\n5 Refer to Appendix A of this document for a full copy of the ABS advice.  \n\n  External statistical assurance of the Senate ballot papers \n\n2\n\n\n--- Page 5 ---\n\nAustralian Electoral Commission | July 2022 \n\nbe performed as planned. This deviation from the agreed methodology is considered to be low risk as assurance \ntesters independently determined when to select the BPTCs for testing. \n\nDue to a number of unplanned staff absences in the Northern Territory CSS location, extractions were \n1.17 \nnot performed in line with the extraction schedules and as a result, there was a risk of significant under sampling \nin the Northern Territory. To overcome this risk and deviation from the agreed methodology, Axiom instructed \nthe Northern Territory assurance staff to extract the sample by selecting two batches from each BPTC selected \nand testing five ballot papers in each batch. In effect, selecting 10 ballot papers from a single BPTC rather than \nfive as specified in the approved methodology. This allowed for confidence that assurance testing was being \nperformed  on  BPTCs  that  had  been  extracted  immediately  after  scanning.  This  deviation  from  the  agreed \nmethodology is considered to be low risk because the independence of sample selection was maintained and \nthe principles of the cluster sampling (five in a batch) was preserved.  \n\nASSURANCE TESTING  \n1.18 \n\nAssurance testing was undertaken using a two-stage testing approach.  \n\n1.19 \nThe  first  stage  tested  the  physical  ballot  paper  to  the  scanned  image  transmitted  to  the  AEC  and \nincluded in BPRS. The first stage testing assessed the completeness and accuracy of the physical ballot paper to \nthe scanned image. It was used to validate that all marks on the scanned image were an exact replica of the \nphysical ballot paper.  \n\nThe second stage tested the physical ballot paper to the electronic data used in counting, contained in \n\n1.20 \nBPRS. The second stage testing assessed whether: \n\n \n\n \n\nthe electronic preference data file was an accurate reflection of the preferences recorded on the physical \nballot paper; and  \n\ninterpretation of voter intent aligned with AEC business rules as stated in the Ballot Paper Formality Policy \nand Ballot Paper Formality Guidelines. Figure 1 outlines the two-stage testing approach.  \n\nFigure 1: Two-stage ballot paper assurance testing approach \n\n1.21 \n\nThe ballot paper assurance testing was designed to detect the following:  \n\n  where the scanned image was an incomplete representation of the physical ballot paper (the marks on the \n\nscanned image were not an exact replica of the physical ballot paper); and  \n\n  where preferences recorded on the physical ballot paper did not match the electronic data in BPRS which \n\nwas used in counting.  \n\n  External statistical assurance of the Senate ballot papers \n\n3\n\n\n--- Page 6 ---\n\nAustralian Electoral Commission | July 2022 \n\nThe assurance testing approach was designed to identify potential exceptions impacting on statistical \n\n1.22 \nassurance results. The types of potential exceptions the assurance was designed to identify included6:  \n\n  where no scanned image that exactly replicates the physical ballot paper can be found; \n\n \n\nvoter  disenfranchised  where  a  vote  was  recorded  as  informal  when  the  voter  expressed  a  valid \npreference(s); \n\n  above the line voter preference sequence was broken too early within the first six preferences; \n\n  above the line voter preference sequence was broken too early after the first six preferences; \n\n  below the line voter preference sequence was broken too early within the first twelve preferences; \n\n  below the line voter preference sequence was broken too early after the first twelve preferences; \n\n \n\n \n\nvoter preference sequence was broken too late (additional preferences were recorded); and \n\nvote recorded as formal when it should have been informal.  \n\n1.23 \nAssurance  testing  was  performed  by  Temporary  Election  Workforce  (TEW)  resources  selected  and \nengaged  by  the  AEC  to  act  as  assurance  testers.  To  maintain  independence  of  the  assurance  activities \nperformed,  Axiom  received  representations  from  the  AEC  that  no  assurance  testers  had  performed  non-\nassurance activities in the relevant CSS state and territory location for the 2022 Senate election.  \n\nAssurance  testers  were  trained  by  Axiom  on  the  assurance  approach,  detailed  methodology, \n1.24 \noperational approach and expectations prior to the election. For the Northern Territory, the assurance testers \nwere  also  provided  with  supplementary  training.  The  AEC  recruited  additional  assurance  testers  after  the \nelection  in  the  Northern  Territory  and  Victoria.  These  additional  assurance  staff  were  also  provided  with \ntraining.  \n\n Any  questions  or  issues  related  to  the  application  of  the  assurance  methodology  and  results  were \n\n1.25 \nrequired to be referred to, and answered by, Axiom staff.  \n\n1.26  With  one  exception,  Axiom  staff  performed  their  activities  remotely.  The  assurance  testers  in  the \nVictorian  CSS  location  identified  a  number  of  complex  potential  exceptions  which  required  an  Axiom  staff \nmember to visit the CSS location to assist with resolution of the exceptions. \n\nQUALITY ASSURANCE  \n1.27 \nof re-performance of 30% of stage two testing by different assurance testers.  \n\nBallot paper assurance testing was subject to quality assurance. Quality assurance activities consisted \n\n1.28  Quality assurance activities assessed whether:  \n\n \n\n \n\nthe electronic preference data file was an accurate reflection of the preferences recorded on the electronic \nscanned image of the ballot paper; and  \n\ninterpretation of voter intent aligned with AEC business rules as stated in the Ballot Paper Formality Policy \nand Ballot Paper Formality Guidelines.  \n\n6 For the 2022 Federal Election, voter instructions on the Senate ballot paper were to number a minimum of six preferences above \nthe line or twelve preferences below the line, across all states and territories. These instructions were used as the cut off for the \nclassification of exceptions.  \n\n  External statistical assurance of the Senate ballot papers \n\n4\n\n\n--- Page 7 ---\n\nAustralian Electoral Commission | July 2022 \n\n1.29 \nIn addition, all assurance test sheets were reviewed by Axiom staff and all potential exceptions were \nconfirmed and collated by Axiom. The Axiom review of test sheets and the quality assurance processes did not \nindicate issues with the quality and consistency of testing performed by any of the assurance testing teams.  \n\nAEC REVIEW OF POTENTIAL EXCEPTIONS  \n1.30 \nStage Two potential exceptions frequently arise because of judgements, by Fujifilm and AEC staff, about \nthe interpretation of preferences recorded on ballot papers. These judgements are intended to be determined \nthrough the application of the AEC’s Ballot Paper Formality Policy and Ballot Paper Formality Guidelines.  \n\n1.31 \nAll  potential  exceptions  from  Stage  Two  testing  were  subject  to  review  by  three  experienced  AEC \nofficers. The purpose of this AEC review was to confirm how AEC experienced officers would apply the AEC \nbusiness rules for interpretation of voter intent. The AEC chose four experienced officers to perform the AEC \nreview of potential exceptions. The AEC review of potential exceptions was performed by three of the four AEC \nofficers. Three tranches of potential exceptions were sent to and reviewed by the AEC officers as follows: \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\ntranche one sent on 17 June 2022 to officers 1, 2 and 3;  \n\ntranche two sent on 22 June 2022 to officers 1, 2 and 3; and  \n\ntranche three sent on 28 June 2022 to officers 1, 2 and 4 (to accommodate leave taken by AEC officer 3).  \n\n1.32 \nFor each potential exception identified in Stage Two testing by the ballot paper assurance process, the \nexperienced AEC officers were asked to independently ‘blind test’ the relevant ballot paper and to assess how \nthe voter intent should be interpreted and recorded in BPRS. Where: \n\n  all three AEC experience officers considered that the application of the AEC business rules would result in \nan interpretation of the ballot paper that differed to that which had been recorded in BPRS, an exception \nwas recorded in the final assurance results; and \n\n \n\nin all other cases, the potential assurance exception was not recorded in the final assurance results.  \n\n1.33 \n\nResults from the AEC review of potential exceptions were assessed and collated by Axiom staff. \n\nREPORT CREATION – STATISTICAL ANALYSIS  \n1.34 \nAll exceptions identified from the assurance process  (including AEC  review of potential  exceptions) \nwere collated at the state and territory level and at the national level by Axiom staff. Axiom followed the ABS’ \nguidance for calculating, analysing and reporting the statistical conclusions that may be drawn from the 2022 \nSenate external statistical assurance activities.7  \n\nThe  assurance  results  and  conclusions  have  been  expressed  as  state  and  territory  and  national \n1.35 \nexception  rates.  As  the  ballot  paper  assurance  approach  uses  a  different  sampling  rate  for  each  state  and \nterritory location, the national exception rate was derived using the weighted number of exceptions in each \nstate and territory location relative to the state and territory proportion of the national vote for 2022.  \n\n1.36 \nStage One exceptions were not attributed to individual state or territory locations. One element of the \nABS methodology was based on the AEC assertion that scanning processes were homogenous across Australia \nand the methodology provided for a single national sample for the assessment of Stage One exceptions.  \n\n7 Australian Bureau of Statistics, ABS advice to AEC on sampling methodology, November 2021, p. 4. \n\n  External statistical assurance of the Senate ballot papers \n\n5\n\n\n--- Page 8 ---\n\nAustralian Electoral Commission | July 2022 \n\n2. FINDINGS, STATISTICAL ANALYSIS AND STATEMENT OF ASSURANCE \nOUTCOMES  \n\nAn  analysis  of  the  findings  of  the  Senate  ballot  paper  sampling  process  has  been  provided  below. \n\n2.1 \nExceptions impacting on the statistical assurance results were considered in each stage of assurance testing.  \n\nFor Stage One of assurance testing, which compared the physical ballot paper to the scanned image transmitted \nto  the  AEC  and  included  in  BPRS,  a  total  of  seven  exceptions  were  identified.  These  exceptions  were  not \nattributed to individual state or territory locations when calculating the statistical exception rate in order to \nalign the analysis to the  agreed methodology based on advice from the Australian Bureau of Statistics. The \nseven Stage One exceptions are described in Table 2.  \n\nTable 2: Stage One exceptions identified during assurance testing  \n\nCSS state and \nterritory \nlocation \nNSW \n\nNT \n\nVIC \n\nDescription of the exception  \n\nTwo physical ballot papers in a sampled batch could not be matched against scanned images \nin that batch. The scanned images in the batch included duplicate images for two other ballot \npapers in the batch.  \nThe scanned image of one physical ballot paper did not reflect the preferences recorded on \nthe physical ballot paper. The physical ballot paper had a light ‘smudge’ over one preference. \nThis ‘smudge’ did not obscure the number entered into the box on the physical ballot paper. \nThe scanned image enhanced the ‘smudge’ to extent that it was not possible to distinguish \nthe preference number on the scanned image of the ballot paper and consequently it was \nnot recorded in BPRS.  \nOne physical ballot paper in a sampled batch could not be matched against scanned images \nin that batch. The batch contained 51 physical ballot papers and only 50 scanned images \nwere associated with that batch.  \nThree  physical  ballot  papers  in  a  sampled  batch  could  not  be  matched  against  scanned \nimages in that batch. Despite efforts to locate the associated images, these could not be \nfound. \n\n2.2 \nFor Stage Two assurance testing, which compared the physical ballot paper to the electronic data used \nin counting and contained in BPRS, a total of 33 exceptions were identified. These exceptions related to the \naccuracy  of  the  electronic  preference  data  file  (used  in  counting)  and  the  interpretation  of  voter  intent. \nDetermination  of  voter  intent  should  be  in  line  with  the  AEC  business  rules  as  stated  in  the  Ballot  Paper \nFormality Policy and Ballot Paper Formality Guidelines.  \n\n2.3 \nThe 33 exceptions have been classified in accordance with the approved assurance methodology. The \nclassification of exceptions has been outlined in Table 3. An additional classification of exceptions has been \nincluded in the table below to reflect the assurance findings.

Another 24% related to where the ATL voter preference sequence was broken too early \nwithin the first six preferences. 15% of exceptions related to the counting of an informal vote (i.e., where vote \nwas informal and should have been excluded from the count).  \n\n2.5 \nStage Two exceptions frequently arose because of the inconsistent application of the AEC’s business \nrules, by either Fujifilm or AEC officers. Each assurance exception reflects an assessment of the marks on a ballot \npaper that has been identified as being inconsistent with the AEC Ballot Paper Formality Policy and/or the AEC \nBallot Paper Formality Guidelines. There was no suggestion of any political or logical bias in the exceptions. The \neffect of including the exceptions in the count would have resulted in, some increase and /or some reduction \nto some candidates in the number of preferences counted.  \n\n2.6 \nSimilarly,  the  exceptions  identified  did  not  suggest  any  systematic  basis  for  including  or  excluding \npreferences or ballot papers. Many exceptions were the result of the need for interpretation where voters did \nnot follow numbering instructions (including x’s and ticks and words rather than numerals) or where numbering \nsequences for preferences were not clearly written on the ballot paper. \n\n2.7 \nThe  statistical  analysis  of  the  results  of  the  assurance  testing  was  carried  out  in  line  with  the  ABS \nmethodology. The AEC required the presentation of the statistical results to be in the form of a sample mean \nwith a 95% confidence interval with upper and lower bounds. The proportion of exceptions identified in the \nsample tested was extrapolated to the population of Senate ballot papers used in the AEC Tally Room. Table 4 \noutlines the statistical analysis and results.  The results were analysed to provide 95% confidence over the range \nof possible exceptions in the populations (CSS state and territory location and national).8 This analysis indicates \nthat there is a 95% likelihood that the true number of exceptions within the populations is within the stated \nranges in the table.  \n\n8 The confidence intervals for 95% confidence are intended to provide assurance that, all things being equal, if an \nadditional 100 samples from the population were tested, that for 95 of the 100 samples, the sample the mean would \nlie in the stated range. \n\n  External statistical assurance of the Senate ballot papers \n\n7\n\n\n--- Page 10 ---\n\nAustralian Electoral Commission | July 2022 \n\nTable 4: Statistical analysis and results  \n\nStatistical sampling characteristics\n\nCSS state and \nterritory location\n\nActual number of \nballot papers a\n\nLocation as a \n% of national \ntotal \n\nStage 1 \nexceptions c\n\nNSW\n0.473%\nVIC\n0.641%\nQLD\n0.222%\nWA\n0.303%\n0.471%\nSA\n0.510%\nTAS\n0.264%\nACT\n0.173%\nNT\nNational\n0.069%\nTotals\n0.443%\nNote a - Actual number of ballot papers was sourced from AEC BPRS on 30 June 2022 (Ballot papers on Tally Room)\nNote b - Confidence interval calculations from https://www.abs.gov.au/websitedbs/d3310114.nsf/home/sample+size+calculator  \nNote c - National (Stage 1) exceptions are attributed to each CSS location in line with their proportion of the national vote\n\n4,996,110\n3,960,958\n3,111,034\n1,571,899\n1,162,472\n372,973\n290,308\n106,907\n15,572,661\n15,572,661\n\n32.1%\n25.4%\n20.0%\n10.1%\n7.5%\n2.4%\n1.9%\n0.7%\n100.0%\n\n23,619\n25,378\n6,905\n4,759\n5,474\n1,901\n766\n185\n10,790\n68,988\n\n7\n7\n\n33\n\nAssurance \nsample size \n1,735\n1,400\n1,310\n1,285\n1,245\n1,135\n1,028\n965\n10,103\n10,103\n\nStage 2 \nexceptions\n7\n8\n2\n3\n5\n5\n2\n1\n\nException rate \nincluding national \nStage  1 \nexceptions c\n\nExtrapolated \nnumber of \nexceptions\n\nAEC \nconfidence \nlevel\n\n Upper exception \nrate as a %\n\nStatistical sampling outcomes b\nUpper limit: highest \nnumber of ballot \npapers that are 95% \nlikely to have an \nexception\n\nLower exception \nrate as a %\n\nLower limit: lowest \nnumber of ballot \npapers that are 95% \nlikely to have an \nexception\n\n95%\n95%\n95%\n95%\n95%\n95%\n95%\n95%\n\n95%\n\n0.796%\n1.059%\n0.477%\n0.604%\n0.851%\n0.924%\n0.577%\n0.434%\n\n0.572%\n\n39,769\n41,947\n14,840\n9,494\n9,893\n3,446\n1,675\n464\n\n89,076\n\n0.150%\n0.223%\n0.000%\n0.002%\n0.091%\n0.096%\n0.000%\n0.000%\n\n0.314%\n\n7494\n8833\n0\n31\n1058\n358\n0\n0\n\n48,898\n\nThe analysis of the Senate assurance results indicates  that there is a 0.45% exception rate in the assurance sample.  9 The AEC can be 95% confident that, \n2.8 \nnationally, the number of exceptions in 1,000 ballot papers is between 3.210 and 5.8. This can be analysed at a CSS state and territory location level. These have been \nlisted below:  \n\n  NSW – The AEC can be 95% confident that there are between 1.5 and 8 exceptions in 1,000 ballot papers.  \n  VIC – The AEC can be 95% confident that there are between 2.3 and 11 exceptions in 1,000 ballot papers. \n  QLD – The AEC can be 95% confident that there are between 0 and 4.8 exceptions in 1,000 ballot papers. \n  WA – The AEC can be 95% confident that there are between 0 and 6.1 exceptions in 1,000 ballot papers. \n  SA – The AEC can be 95% confident that there are between 0.9 and 8.6 exceptions in 1,000 ballot papers. \n  TAS – The AEC can be 95% confident that there are between 0.9 and 9.3 exceptions in 1,000 ballot papers. \n  ACT – The AEC can be 95% confident that there are between 0 and 5.8 exceptions in 1,000 ballot papers. \n  NT – The AEC can be 95% confident that there are between 0 and 4.4 exceptions in 1,000 ballot papers. \n\n9 This can also be expressed as follows, for 99.55% of ballot papers in the sample there was matching data in the AEC systems for the count, in addition the AEC can be 95% \nconfident that the true population value is between 99.42% (99.55%-0.129%) and 99.68%. (99.55%+0.129%), or 99.55% +/- 0.129%. \n10 All numbers have been rounded to the next whole decimal point. \n\n  External statistical assurance of the Senate ballot papers \n\n8\n\n\n--- Page 11 ---\n\nAustralian Electoral Commission | July 2022 \n\nAPPENDICES \n\nAPPENDIX  A:  MARKS  ON  BALLOT  PAPERS  NOT  RECORDED  ACCURATELY  IN  BPRS \nWITH NO IMPACT ON THE COUNT \n\nThe Stage Two assurance testing compared the physical ballot paper to the electronic data used in counting, \ncontained in BPRS.
