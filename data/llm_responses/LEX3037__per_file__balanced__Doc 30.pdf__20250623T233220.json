The email serves as a formal content referral regarding a specific video on TikTok. The AEC asserts the video breaches TikTok’s \"Integrity and Authenticity policy\" by making multiple false claims, including:\n*   Falsely claiming the 2010 Federal Election was won by a smaller margin than alleged multiple votes.\n*   Falsely claiming dead people are enrolled to vote.\n*   Falsely claiming identification is not required to enrol to vote.\n*   Falsely claiming one specific party is engaged in widespread electoral fraud.\nThe email further states the video breaches Section 321D of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 due to the absence of both a written and spoken authorisation message. The AEC requests swift action given the serious nature of the claims.\n\n### Relevance to FOI Request (LEX3037)\n\nThis document is highly relevant to FOI request LEX3037 as it provides a concrete example of the \"extensive communication\" and \"proactive engagement\" between the AEC (specifically involving its Electoral Integrity Assurance Taskforce) and major tech companies, such as TikTok, during early 2022. It directly illustrates the AEC's efforts to:\n*   **Identify and monitor:** The AEC actively found a video on TikTok containing problematic content.\n*   **Address misinformation/disinformation:** The email details specific false claims (misinformation/disinformation) the video propagated.\n*   **Address non-compliant content:** It highlights the breach of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 (Section 321D) regarding authorisation.\n*   **Utilize direct communication channels and content referrals:** The email itself is a direct referral to TikTok requesting action.\n*   **Safeguard election integrity:** The underlying purpose of the referral is to remove or address content that could undermine public trust in the electoral process, thereby safeguarding the integrity of the 2022 federal election."
