Key staff involved include Melanie Chan (Secretariat Officer, VIC Redistribution Secretariat), Nicole Taylor (National Redistributions Manager), Rebecca Bartleman (Secretariat Officer), and Evan Ekin-Smyth (Assistant Director, Media).\n\nThe documents are:\n*   Three emails dated between 8/02/2018 and 12/02/2018, discussing \"Other Corangamite names\" or \"Corangamite names.\"\n*   One email dated 28/03/2018, regarding \"May Cox para.\"\n*   Six emails dated 5/04/2018, all titled \"Picture – May Cox,\" exchanged between Melanie Chan, Nicole Taylor, and Evan Ekin-Smyth. Two of these are S47F-edited copies of email strings.\n*   One additional S47F-edited email string also dated 5/04/2018 and titled \"Picture – May Cox.\"\n\n**Main Content Relating to the FOI Request:**\nThe documents reflect internal AEC discussions regarding the renaming of the Division of Corangamite to the Division of Cox. Early emails in February 2018 focus on \"other Corangamite names\" or general \"Corangamite names,\" indicating the initial stages of name consideration.\n\nLater communications, particularly those from late March and early April 2018, specifically reference \"May Cox para\" and repeatedly use the subject \"Picture – May Cox.\" The involvement of the Assistant Director of Media, Evan Ekin-Smyth, in these April emails strongly suggests that the discussions moved to address potential public perception, media handling, or concerns about the appropriateness or misinterpretation of the \"Cox\" name, aligning directly with the FOI request's focus on the \"potential for the name to be misinterpreted/joked about.\" The S47F redactions in some email strings further indicate sensitive internal discussions or advice related to this subject.\n\nProvide only the markdown formatted summary text. Do not include any conversational filler or preamble."
