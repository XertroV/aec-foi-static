            "text": "The document is a formal \"NOTICE UNDER SECTION 321F OF THE COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL ACT 1918\" from Andrew Johnson, Chief Legal Officer of the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC), to Dr. Andrew Laming MP, dated June 2, 2021.\n\nThe notice requires Dr. Laming to produce information and documents relating to suspected contraventions of Section 321D of the Electoral Act, specifically concerning the mandatory authorisation particulars for electoral matter communicated on social media. The AEC suspects that between November 18, 2018, and May 18, 2019, Dr. Laming, as a Disclosure Entity (Member of the House of Representatives), communicated electoral matter through posts on various Facebook pages without the required disclosures.\n\nThe Facebook pages specifically identified in the notice include:\n*   Redland Hospital: Let's Fight for Fair Funding\n*   Redland Bay Bulletin\n*   Redlands Institute\n*   Thornlands 4164\n*   Victoria Point News\n\nThe notice demands detailed information, including:\n*   Identification of all Facebook pages administered by or on behalf of Dr. Laming (including his Facebook account ID 100000494042921).\n*   Time periods of page publication and administration.\n*   Instructions given by Laming regarding content and operation of these pages.\n*   Steps taken to disclose mandatory authorisation particulars (name and relevant town/city).\n*   Information about specific email addresses linked to Laming's Facebook account.\n\nIt also demands complete copies of current and historical versions of these pages (in HTML and JSON format), as well as any documents (emails, chat messages, SMS) evidencing communications about the pages, historical changes, or administrator identities. The notice highlights that providing false or misleading information is a criminal offence.\n\n**Relevance to the FOI Request:**\nThis document is a core component of the FOI request's subject matter. It directly confirms the AEC's active investigation into Andrew Laming MP's Facebook pages for compliance with federal electoral authorisation laws. The notice specifies the very Facebook pages (*e.g., \"Redland Bay Bulletin,\" \"Redlands Institute,\" \"Victoria Point News\"*) that the FOI overview described as being \"disguised as community or news groups to promote political content and attack opponents without mandatory disclosures.\" The notice's focus on \"unauthorised electoral communications\" without \"mandatory authorisation particulars\" directly addresses the central allegation of the FOI request. Furthermore, it exemplifies the AEC \"issu[ing] formal notices to Laming for detailed information,\" a key investigative step mentioned in the FOI overview. The reference to Section 321D underscores the application of the 2018 Electoral Act amendments to social media authorisation."

Do not include any conversational filler or preamble.To aid you, the overview of the FOI request is: [REQUEST OVERVIEW START] The FOI request disclosed documents detailing the Australian Electoral Commission's (AEC) investigation into Andrew Laming MP's Facebook pages for compliance with federal electoral authorisation laws. This inquiry was triggered by public complaints and media reports, notably from *The Guardian*, alleging Laming used numerous pages (e.g., \"Redland Bay Bulletin,\" \"Redlands Institute\") disguised as community or news groups to promote political content and attack opponents without mandatory disclosures. The AEC confirmed an active investigation, noting 2018 Electoral Act amendments broadened social media authorisation, and issued formal notices to Laming for detailed information and to third parties (like Facebook) for data, with Facebook confirming its cooperation. Findings revealed some pages were removed or updated with authorisation, while others remained active and unauthorised.\n [REQUEST OVERVIEW END] \n\n--- MAIN DOCUMENT TEXT START ---\n\n\n\n--- Page 1 ---\n\nAEC.0002.0001.7203\n\nh)AEC Australian Electoral Commission • Dr Andrew Laming alaming2@bigpond.com Dear Dr Laming NOTICE UNDER SECTION 321 F OF THE COMMONWEAL TH ELECTORAL ACT 1918 Whereas I, Andrew Johnson, a delegate of the Electoral Commissioner, have reason to believe that Dr Laming (you) have information and documents relating to assessment of compliance with section 321 D of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 (Electoral Act).
