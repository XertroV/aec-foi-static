The paper outlines three membership testing rounds for the Seniors United Party of Australia (SUPA), with initial tests in October 2020 and February 2021 failing to meet the 500-member threshold, leading to deregistration. However, a September 2021 test, conducted during an internal review, successfully verified SUPA's membership, leading to the party's re-registration. The paper also systematically addresses SUPA's claims of unfairness (e.g., due to demographics, alleged errors, lack of scrutineers), asserting the methodology's consistent application, impartiality, and focus on formal membership, thus demonstrating its adherence to the principles of rationality, fairness, and practicality."

  "prompt": "Create a concise, single-paragraph summary in markdown format of the following FOI request summary:\n\nSummary:\n\n### Summary of FOI Request Documents\n\nThis summary outlines the main purpose of FOI Request No. LEX3177, the documents released in response, and their key content relevant to the request.\n\n#### 1. Main Purpose of the FOI Request\n\nThe FOI request (LEX3177) sought \"all supporting documents behind the commission's conclusion that 'the [AEC's membership testing] methodology was appropriate for membership testing, including because it was rational, fair and practical in all the circumstances'\" as stated in a previous determination (LEX967). Specifically, it requested documents supporting the claims of rationality and fairness.\n\n#### 2. Documents from the FOI Request\n\nThe primary document released is the **\"Commission Paper – Review of the delegate’s decision to deregister the Senior United Party of Australia\"** dated 17 November 2021. This paper incorporates and references several attachments, including:\n\n*   **Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) Testing Methodology Tables (November 2016):** These tables outline the statistical sampling framework for membership testing based on the number of members lodged and the maximum permissible denials. (Attachments L, ZW)\n*   **Advice provided to the Commission in relation to Party registration (20 March 2017):** This document confirms the Electoral Commission's re-endorsement of the ABS methodology. (Attachment B)\n*   **Application for review and further submission by the party officer (21 & 25 March 2021):** These detail the Seniors United Party of Australia's (SUPA) reasons for challenging the deregistration decision. (Attachments N, P)\n*   **Records of Membership Testing Outcomes (various dates):**\n    *   October 2020 List testing outcomes (Attachment I)\n    *   February 2021 List testing outcomes (Attachment M)\n    *   September 2021 List testing outcomes, including identification of duplicates and cross-party members (Attachment ZV), contact records (Attachment ZX), and a breakdown of membership numbers (Attachment ZY).\n\n#### 3. Main Content Related to the FOI Request\n\nThe released documents directly address the \"appropriateness, rationality, fairness, and practicality\" of the AEC's membership testing methodology through the review of the Seniors United Party of Australia's (SUPA) deregistration.\n\n**AEC's Methodology and its Application:**\n\n*   **Foundation:** The Commission Paper (Para 3.14) states that the AEC's membership testing methodology, for lists of 500 individuals, was developed by the **Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS)** in 2010 (with updates in 2011 and 2017) and re-endorsed by the Electoral Commission in 2017. This endorsement and the ABS origin are presented as foundational to its rationality and appropriateness.\n*   **Testing Rounds:**\n    *   **October 2020 List:** An initial test of SUPA's list of 525 claimed members required a random sample of 37 individuals, allowing for a maximum of 3 denials. The test resulted in 8 denials, leading to a determination of insufficient members (Para 5.1-5.2).\n    *   **February 2021 List:** A second test of SUPA's list of 539 claimed members (after initial deregistration notice) required a sample of 44 individuals, allowing for a maximum of 5 denials. This test resulted in 9 denials, reinforcing the deregistration decision (Para 6.2-6.3).\n    *   **September 2021 List (during review):** During the internal review, a new list of 538 eligible members was tested. This required a sample of 44 individuals, with a maximum of 5 denials permitted. This test resulted in only **1 denial** (Para 8.18-8.19), which provided statistical confidence that the party had at least 500 members.\n\n**Addressing Claims of Unfairness/Impracticality:**\n\nThe SUPA party officer, in their application for review, raised concerns about the fairness and practicality of the methodology for an elderly demographic, citing:\n*   Higher death rates and health issues.\n*   Dementia/memory loss leading to negative responses.\n*   Fear of phone scammers causing refusal to answer or negative responses.\n*   Alleged AEC errors in identifying duplicates/deceased members.\n*   Lack of scrutineers during testing (unlike election polling).\n*   The party's unique demographic representation and financial disadvantages.\n\nThe Commission Paper responds to these points (Para 8.12-8.17):\n*   It states that the methodology requires formal acknowledgment of membership and does not consider individual motivations or reasons for denials.\n*   It clarifies that deceased and duplicate members are removed from the list *before* sampling, not counted as negative responses, which can be beneficial to parties by reducing the required sample size for eligible members. It confirms internal review found no errors in duplicate/deceased identification.\n*   It affirms that the Electoral Act does not provide for scrutineers in membership testing.\n*   It asserts that factors such as a party's policies, demographics, or financial situation are *not relevant* to the statutory 500-member requirement and that the AEC applies the same, consistent test across all parties to maintain political neutrality.\n\n**Conclusion of the Review:**\n\nDespite the initial deregistration and the party officer's arguments, the successful outcome of the **September 2021 membership test** (1 denial out of 44 responses) demonstrated that SUPA *did* meet the 500-member threshold according to the established ABS methodology. This led the Electoral Commission to recommend setting aside the delegate's deregistration decision and substituting it with a decision to **maintain the registration of the Seniors United Party of Australia** (Para 8.20, 9.1). This final outcome suggests that the methodology, despite initial failures by the party, was ultimately capable of affirming membership when the threshold was met.\n\nProvide only the markdown formatted summary text. Do not include any conversational filler or preamble."
