Despite initial compliance on roll numbers, a required sample of 26 members for direct contact allowed for a maximum of one denial of membership. However, out of 52 members contacted, two individuals denied their membership (one confirmed via phone call), exceeding the permissible limit. Consequently, the 'Stop Selling Australia' party \"FAILED\" the membership testing, leading the AEC to recommend refusal of their application under section 131 of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918, while offering the party an opportunity to vary their application to avoid outright refusal."

After initial checks and subsequent updates provided by the party, a list of 550 members was processed.\n2.  **Electoral Roll Matching:** The AEC's Roll Management Section (RMANS) conducted checks against the electoral roll.\n    *   An email dated 24 January 2019 showed 406 members matched, 133 had no match, and 11 had multiple matches out of 550.\n    *   A later email dated 28 February 2019 indicated 404 matched, 135 no match, and 11 multiple matches.\n    *   Ultimately, after manual identification efforts, **503 members were identified as being on the electoral roll**.\n3.  **Membership Testing (Direct Contact):** To verify the membership, the AEC conducted a random sample test.\n    *   Based on ABS methodology, a sample size of **26 members** was required for direct contact, with a maximum of **1 denial** of membership permitted for the party to pass.\n    *   The AEC attempted to contact **52 members** in total, as some were uncontactable. Emails (Document 22) were sent to individuals requesting confirmation of membership.\n    *   Document 21 highlights a critical case: one individual initially provided a seemingly neutral email response, but a subsequent phone call (as per the FOI request's interest in phone responses) revealed they **denied being a member** of 'Stop Selling Australia'.\n4.  **Results and Outcome:**\n    *   Out of the contacted sample, **24 members confirmed** their membership.\n    *   However, **2 members denied** their membership, exceeding the permitted single denial.\n    *   **Therefore, the 'Stop Selling Australia' party's application \"FAILED\" the membership testing assessment.**\n5.  **AEC Decision:** As detailed in Document 25 (Minute to delegate) and Document 26 (s 131 Notice), the AEC determined that the application, in its current form, did not satisfy the requirements of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918, primarily due to failing the membership test. The AEC issued a notice under subsection 131(1) of the Act, advising the party that the application would be refused in its current form but offering the opportunity to vary the application (e.g., provide a new, compliant membership list) to avoid refusal.\n\nProvide only the markdown formatted summary text. Do not include any conversational filler or preamble."
