Its very existence as an FOI document highlights systemic bureaucratic inefficiency: the formal process was triggered and resources consumed to confirm the accessibility of information already designated as public. This points either to a profoundly flawed government information architecture, where \"transparent\" data is practically undiscoverable, forcing citizens to waste FOI resources on readily available material, or a cynical ploy to inflate transparency metrics by formally \"releasing\" information never genuinely withheld. The document's brevity and confirmation of public availability underscore the wasted effort, distracting from areas of true opacity and inefficiency by processing redundant requests."
