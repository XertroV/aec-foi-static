Do not include any conversational filler or preamble.To aid you, the overview of the FOI request is: [REQUEST OVERVIEW START] An FOI request sought minutes from Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) meetings held between March 2, 2021, and October 19, 2022, resulting in the release of seven sets of endorsed, edited minutes. These documents primarily detail the Commission's decisions and discussions concerning political party registration, deregistration, and name changes, alongside the evolving methodology for verifying party membership, particularly in response to legislative amendments increasing the minimum member requirement from 500 to 1,500. Key discussions included seeking Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) advice on membership testing, and specific rulings on party names (e.g., \"The New Liberals,\" \"Liberal Democratic Party\"), deregistration (e.g., \"Australian People’s Party,\" \"VOTEFLUX.ORG\"), and re-registration (e.g., \"Seniors United Party of Australia\").\n [REQUEST OVERVIEW END] \n\n--- MAIN DOCUMENT TEXT START ---\n\n\n\n--- Page 1 ---\n\nRequest for: \n\n•  The minutes of all meetings of The Commission that took place between March 2nd 2021 and October 19th 2022 (dates which span ~596 days). \n\nDoc No.  Document description \n\nExemption/s \n\nDecision on Access \n\nSCHEDULE OF RELEASED DOCUMENTS \n\nEndorsed minutes for Commission Meeting No. 272, held on 18 March 2021 \n\n47F \n\nEdited copy \n\nEndorsed minutes for Commission Meeting No. 273, held on 3 September 2021 \n\n42, 47F \n\nEdited copy \n\nEndorsed minutes for Commission Meeting No. 274, held on 6 October 2021 \n\n47F \n\nEdited copy \n\nEndorsed minutes for Commission Meeting No. 276, held on 17 November 2021 \n\n47F \n\nEdited copy \n\nEndorsed minutes for Commission Meeting No. 277, held on 8 February 2022 \n\n47F \n\nEdited copy\n\n\n--- Page 2 ---\n\nDoc No.  Document description \n\nExemption/s \n\nDecision on Access \n\nEndorsed minutes for Commission Meeting No. 278, held on 29 March 2022 \n\n47F \n\nEdited copy \n\nEndorsed minutes for Commission Meeting No. 279, held on 26 September 2022 \n\n47C, 47F \n\nEdited copy\n\n"
