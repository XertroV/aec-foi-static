            "text": "The document outlines the Australian Electoral Commission's (AEC) investigation into Andrew Laming MP's Facebook pages concerning compliance with federal electoral authorisation laws. Triggered by public complaints and media reports, notably from *The Guardian*, the inquiry addressed allegations that Laming used numerous pages (e.g., \"Redland Bay Bulletin,\" \"Redlands Institute\"), disguised as community or news groups, to promote political content and attack opponents without mandatory disclosures. The AEC confirmed an active investigation, referencing the 2018 Electoral Act amendments that broadened social media authorisation. Formal notices were issued to Laming for information and to third parties like Facebook for data, with Facebook confirming cooperation. The investigation's findings indicated that some pages were subsequently removed or updated with proper authorisation, while others remained active and unauthorised.\n\n**Relevance to FOI Request:** This document is directly relevant as it constitutes the core disclosure from the FOI request, detailing the AEC's complete investigative process into Andrew Laming MP's alleged breaches of electoral authorisation laws on social media. It provides specifics on the triggers for the inquiry, the methods employed by the AEC (e.g., formal notices to Laming and Facebook), the legal framework applied (2018 Electoral Act amendments), and the tangible outcomes regarding the compliance status of Laming's Facebook pages. This directly fulfills the FOI request's objective to understand the AEC's actions and findings in this matter."
