            "text": "## Summary of FOI Request Documents\n\n### Main Purpose of the FOI Request\nThe main purpose of the FOI request was to obtain documents related to the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) methodology for sampling and testing political party membership lists. This was specifically in the context of a review of the decision to deregister a political party, VoteFlux.Org | Upgrade Democracy!, which raised questions about the statistical validity and application of the methodology.\n\n### Documents from the FOI Request\nThe FOI request yielded the following documents:\n*   **Document 1:** Extract of ABS sample size calculator set to a 6% risk of rejecting a valid list. (Published on Disclosure Log)\n*   **Document 2:** Advice from ABS Chief Methodologist on sampling and methodology used, dated 29 July 2022. (Published on Disclosure Log)\n*   **Document 3:** Letter to Mr Tom Rogers, Australian Electoral Commissioner from Dr Gruen AO, Australian Statistician, regarding non-parliamentary political party membership testing methodology, dated 2 September 2022. (Published on Disclosure Log)\n*   **Document 4:** ABS Party membership testing methodology table. (Published on Disclosure Log)\n*   **Document 5:** Advice from ABS Chief Methodologist on sampling and methodology used, dated 19 August 2022. (Access in Part, with exemption 47F applied)\n\n### Main Content from FOI Request Documents\nThe core content, primarily derived from the advice from the ABS Chief Methodologist, addresses key aspects of the sampling methodology:\n\n*   **Statistical Validity of Sampling:** For a sample to allow statistically meaningful conclusions about an entire list (e.g., 4680 names), the sample must be drawn randomly from the whole list. If only a non-random sub-list (e.g., the top 1,650 names) is tested, conclusions can only be drawn about that sub-list, not the entire original list.\n*   **Sample Size and Error Rates:** To test a larger list to the desired confidence levels (probability of accepting an invalid list less than 2%, probability of falsely rejecting a valid list less than 6%), a larger sample size is required. For a list of 4,680 members, an approximate sample size of 564 would be needed, allowing a maximum of 399 denials (non-members). The ABS provides a calculator to determine appropriate sample sizes.\n*   **Effect of Filtering Names:** Filtering names in accordance with ABS methodology (e.g., removing members unlikely to meet requirements) is beneficial to parties. It improves the 'quality' of the list and reduces the likelihood of finding non-members in the sample, thereby decreasing false rejection risks.\n*   **Purpose of Methodology:** The sampling methodology is designed to be a practical and fair method for testing party lists. It aims to encourage parties to maintain accurate membership records and discourages the provision of large \"low quality\" lists, which would require extensive sampling to control false rejection risks.\n*   **Context of Application:** The advice was provided in the context of reviewing a decision to deregister a political party, specifically addressing questions raised about the sampling approach used for their membership list. It underscored that if the correct sampling size is not adopted for a larger list, the likelihood of false rejection increases."

At that meeting we discussed the ABS \n\nThank you for meeting with \nmethodology for sampling and testing membership of political parties used by the AEC. You kindly reviewed some \nquestions we had and considered some issues raised by applications for review of the decision to deregister \nVoteFlux.Org | Upgrade Democracy! (the Party). The purpose of this email is to summarise the key points raised in \nthat discussion. I would be grateful if you could confirm that I have set out your advice correctly. If not, I would be \ngrateful if you could edit the response or reply clarify any points.  \n\nIf possible, we would be grateful for your response by Monday 1 July 2022. We may provide this information to the \nElectoral Commission for the purposes of their review of the decision to deregister the Party. \n\n1. What conclusions can be drawn in relation to the list of 4680 names in the Party’s list, following the delegate’s \ndecision to test the top 1,650 names of that list (the sub-list)? \n\nWith respect to the test conducted it is not the randomisation or not that is causing the false rejection (or false \nacceptance) rate to land outside the limits. It is the sample size that control the test conditions. If you had \nrandomised you would have been able to say something about the whole list as the final sample (probabilistically) \nwould have referred to the 4680 not just the 1650. Nevertheless you still would have needed a bigger sample size to \nget the desired risk rates.  \n\nYou advised that as the Party’s list was not randomised before the sub-list was made (as only the top 1650 names \nwere selected) it is not possible to draw any meaningful statistical conclusions about the Party’s whole list of 4680 \nfrom the results of testing the sub-list. You can only say something about the selected 1650. This is because, without \nrandomisation there is no chance of the other records being selected. You explained this by the analogy of \nattempting to sample from a deck of cards for aces. Having failed to first shuffle the deck, chunking the bottom half \naway, and then sample from what is left will not give you useful information about all original cards. Those thrown \naway were never in the running. \n\nThe test done indicates a list with low proportion of eligible members among the 1650. \n\nDELETE As would usually be the case, as the test of the sub-list failed, it is possible to conclude (to the level of \nconfidence to which the test is set) that the sub-list of 1,650 did not include 1,500 members.  \n\n2. What are the alternative options for testing the larger list? \n\nYou explained that a larger sample size would be required to test a large list to the same degree of confidence. \nCurrent sampling is calibrated so that the probability of accepting an invalid list is less than 2%, and the probability \nof falsely rejecting a valid list is less than 6%. You estimated that the sample size required to test the full list of 4680 \nnames would be over 300. You also advised that excel spreadsheet calculator provided to the AEC could provide \ninformation about the sample size required to test a list of 4680 names to different levels of confidence.  \n\nWe have now used the calculator (attached), to calculate that sampling a list of 4680 members, where the desired \nprobability of false rejection is 6% and the desired probability of false acceptance is 2%, would require an \napproximate sample size of 564 and a maximum number of denials allowed of 399.     \n\n3. Does filtering names affect the error rates? \n\nYou explained that in your view, the arguments made in \n paper with respect to filtering names increasing \nthe error rate are without foundation. You explained that, provided the filtering process is done in accordance with \nthe ABS methodology, filtering names works in favour of parties by removing from a list members who would not \nhave been capable of meeting the requirements.  \n\nCorrect this would improve the ‘quality’ of the list and decrease the occurrence of finding denials (non-members) in \nthe list sample. \n\n4\n\nsection 47FS 47F\n\n\n--- Page 5 ---\n\n4. Your general comments on \n\n paper \n\n hypothetical example. That example \nYou considered that it was not instructive to consider in depth \nstarted from the premise that the party has more than 1,500 and sought to prove that a specific list could be \nrejected by the sampling methodology.  \n\nYou agreed with the general proposition that if the correct sampling size was not adopted in relation to a larger list, \nthe likelihood of false rejection increased. This is shown by the calculator.  \n\nWe also discussed generally the rationale for requiring a smaller sampling size as a practical and fair method for \ntesting party lists. We discussed the difficulties of testing a larger list.  Since the requirement is minimum 1500 a \nparty with a very large list that is ‘low quality’ in the sense that it contains a high percentage of non-members will \nrequire a very big sample size to control false rejection risks. This relates to the incentives of parties to keep good \nrecords of their members and provide the AEC with a high quality list. Providing large low quality lists should be \ndiscouraged.  \n\nLegal Services Section | Legal & Procurement Branch \nAustralian Electoral Commission \n\nDISCLAIMER: \n\nIf you have received this transmission in error please notify us immediately by return email and delete all copies.
