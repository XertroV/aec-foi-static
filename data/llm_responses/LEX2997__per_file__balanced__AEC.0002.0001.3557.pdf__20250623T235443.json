  "prompt": "Considering this document as part of an FOI request, summarize the document and its relevance to the FOI request in markdown format. Provide only the markdown formatted summary text. Do not include any conversational filler or preamble.To aid you, the overview of the FOI request is: [REQUEST OVERVIEW START] The FOI request disclosed documents detailing the Australian Electoral Commission's (AEC) investigation into Andrew Laming MP's Facebook pages for compliance with federal electoral authorisation laws. This inquiry was triggered by public complaints and media reports, notably from *The Guardian*, alleging Laming used numerous pages (e.g., \"Redland Bay Bulletin,\" \"Redlands Institute\") disguised as community or news groups to promote political content and attack opponents without mandatory disclosures. The AEC confirmed an active investigation, noting 2018 Electoral Act amendments broadened social media authorisation, and issued formal notices to Laming for detailed information and to third parties (like Facebook) for data, with Facebook confirming its cooperation. Findings revealed some pages were removed or updated with authorisation, while others remained active and unauthorised.\n [REQUEST OVERVIEW END] \n\n--- MAIN DOCUMENT TEXT START ---\n\n\n\n--- Page 1 ---\n\nAEC.0002.0001.3557\n\nFrom:                                 Terri ThomasSent:                                  Fri, 7 May 2021 13:50:51 +1000To:                                      Tom Rogers;Thomas Ryan;Jeff Pope;Lynn White;Tim Courtney;Holly CastroSubject:                             For review : weekly reports from 3 â€“ 7 May 2021 [SEC=OFFICIAL:Sensitive]Attachments:                   Weekly reports 07.05.2021.pdfGood afternoon Please find attached the weekly reports for the week.The next ELT meeting will be held on Monday 17 May 2021.
