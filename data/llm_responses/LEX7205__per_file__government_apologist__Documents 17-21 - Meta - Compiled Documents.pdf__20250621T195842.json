            "text": "This document serves as compelling evidence of the Australian Electoral Commission’s (AEC) proactive and highly competent approach to safeguarding Australia’s democratic integrity. It showcases the diligent work of the AEC’s Defending Democracy Unit (DDU) and the Electoral Integrity Assurance Taskforce (EIAT) in establishing and maintaining robust, essential partnerships with major online platforms, exemplified here by Meta.\n\nThe detailed exchanges reveal the government’s forward-thinking strategy, initiating regular, critical meetings well in advance of the next federal election. The meticulously planned agendas underscore a comprehensive commitment to addressing emerging challenges, including the pervasive threat of AI-generated content, deepfakes, and foreign interference. Key discussion points, such as learning from global election observations, enhancing public education campaigns, and refining crucial referral and escalation pathways, demonstrate a sound, adaptive policy framework designed to ensure the electoral environment remains secure and trustworthy.\n\nFurthermore, the document highlights Meta’s responsiveness in providing updates on its own rigorous efforts—including highly impactful media literacy campaigns (like the “Check The Facts” initiative with AAP, reaching over 10 million Australians) and robust measures to counter coordinated inauthentic behaviour such as the Russian ‘Doppelganger’ group. The AEC’s persistent follow-up on Meta’s AI content labelling and political advertising policies, alongside their proactive integration of AI-specific scenarios into electoral planning, firmly illustrates the government’s dedication to anticipating and neutralizing threats.\n\nDespite necessary redactions that protect sensitive operational details and vital intelligence, these communications transparently underscore a government deeply committed to transparent, secure, and accessible elections, constantly adapting to emerging challenges through forward-thinking strategies for the public good."

  "prompt": "From a government apologist's viewpoint, summarize this specific document within the context of the FOI request. Emphasize the government's competence, sound policy, or adherence to public interest. The overall FOI overview is: The government, through the Australian Electoral Commission's dedicated Defending Democracy Unit and Electoral Integrity Assurance Taskforce, is commendably safeguarding democratic processes via robust, proactive partnerships with major online platforms including X, Google/YouTube, Meta, Microsoft, and TikTok. These essential collaborations vigorously combat misinformation and disinformation—addressing AI-generated threats, deepfakes, and foreign interference—while enhancing cybersecurity defenses, promoting crucial public awareness campaigns, and sharing global best practices for operational readiness. Proactive measures, such as exploring the protection of individual AEC employees from AI image generation, further demonstrate this commitment to a secure electoral landscape. While some document redactions are necessary to protect sensitive operational details and vital intelligence, these Freedom of Information documents clearly underscore a government deeply dedicated to transparent, secure, and accessible elections, constantly adapting to emerging challenges through forward-thinking strategies for the public good.\n\nDocument Text:\n\nSubject:\nLocation:\n\nStart:\nEnd:\nShow Time As:\n\nPlaceholder: Meta and EIAT meeting\nVirtual/MS Teams\n\nTue 4/03/2025 9:30 AM\nTue 4/03/2025 10:30 AM\nTentative\n\nRecurrence:\n\n(none)\n\nMeeting Status:\n\nNot yet responded\n\nOrganiser:\nRequired Attendees:\n\nEIAT\n\n Matthew Haigh;\n\nGood a(cid:332)ernoon \n\nIn prepara(cid:415)on for the next federal elec(cid:415)on, the Electoral Integrity Assurance Taskforce (EIAT) are arranging \nmee(cid:415)ngs with each of the online pla(cid:414)orms.

Do not click links or \nopen attachments unless you recognise the sender and know the content is safe.  \n\nHi \n\nThank you for your note below and my apologies for the delayed response; just making sure that you have my \ncorrect email address here going forward. \n\nWe are very pleased to provide below the following outstanding updates and information that we discussed in our \nmost recent meetings: \n\nAAP Check the Facts Media Literacy campaign \n\nIn the lead-up to the 2023 Australian Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Voice Referendum, we supported a new \nmedia literacy campaign in collaboration with the Australia Associated Press building on our “Check The Facts” \ncampaign, which ran ahead of the 2022 Federal Election in October 2021 and early 2022. The campaign ran for 6 \nweeks with a combined reach on Facebook and Instagram in Australia of over 10 million users, creating over 40 \nmillion impressions. Further information on the campaign is available on p37 of our latest Transparency Report \nunder the Australian Code of Practice on Disinformation and Misinformation. We also supported AAP to run a new \ncampaign in H2 this year, focused on raising awareness of AI-generated content online. This campaign only recently \nconcluded and we hope to be able to share the results with you in early 2025.  \n\nNetwork disruption efforts to counter the Russian ‘Doppelganger’ group \n\nPlease see a detailed case study outlining this work as well as our wider recent efforts to counter Coordinated \nInauthentic Behaviour on p11 of our latest Transparency Report under the Australian Code of Practice on \nDisinformation and Misinformation, which we submitted through our industry association DIGI in May this year. \n\nMeta’s approach to labelling AI-Generated content and claims regarding the use of AI in political advertising on \nMeta’s platforms during the Indian election \n\nIn April 2024, we announced changes to the way that Meta is handling manipulated media, based on feedback from \nthe Oversight Board and our policy review process with public opinion surveys and expert consultations. This \nincluded adding “AI info” labels to a wider range of video, audio and image content when we detect industry \nstandard AI image indicators or when people disclose that they’re uploading AI-generated content. Further details \non this announcement may be viewed here. \n\nWith respect to advertising, any user who wants to run ads on our services about elections or politics must go \nthrough the authorisation process required on our platforms and is responsible for complying with applicable laws. \nWhenever content on our services - including ads - violates our community standards or community guidelines, we \nremove it, regardless of whether or not it is AI-generated. In the case of the reports specifically raised during this \nyear’s election in India, the authors immediately deleted the ads in question, so we are unable to share any further \ncomment or insight regarding the claims that were made. Leading up to the Australian election, however, we will \nactivate our cross-functional election integrity team to work closely with the AEC and monitor for any violations of \nour policies, including relating to mis and disinformation, hate speech and incitement to violence, in relation to the \nelection process and debate.  \n\n1\n\ns22s47Fs47Fs47Fs47Fs47F \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fFinally, we thought it might also be useful to share with you a recap by our President of Global Affairs, Nick Clegg, \noutlining our efforts and observations across the 2024 global elections, including in the US, India, Indonesia and the \nEU and in relation to the impact of AI, as well as freedom of expression and combating foreign interference. \n\nWe hope that the above information is useful, but please let us know if you have any follow-up questions. We did \nsee the recent press reports that Commissioner Rogers’ term at the AEC has recently concluded. We wish him all the \nvery best and are sure that his many achievements while in the role were well celebrated ahead of his departure. \nWe look forward to the opportunity to meet with the new Commissioner once they are settled into the role in the \nnew year.  \n\nIn the meantime, we wish you all the very best for a safe and happy holiday season and looking forward to working \nwith the AEC in 2025 and collaborating closely ahead of the upcoming election. \n\nKind regards \n\nHead of Policy, Australia & Head of Policy Programs, Australia, New Zealand & Pacific Islands  \n\nFrom: \nDate: Thursday, 5 December 2024 at 11:52 am \nTo: \nCc: \nSubject: RE: REQUEST : Following up on 2024 action items [SEC=OFFICIAL] \n\n , Defending Democracy Unit , \n\nHi \n\n, \n\nJust checking in with a gentle reminder about the below information we requested a couple of weeks back. \n\nYou must have a lot on your plate given the bills relating to social media that went before parliament over the past \ncouple of weeks!

Matt has not yet received a reply. \n\n29 October 2024 - email \n\n  A follow up question was sent via email (attached) to help inform our Media and Digital Engagement team \nabout approached to AI content labelling. We are yet to receive a response/acknowledgement for this one. \n\nLastly, by way of update, we are working towards circulation of the online platform scenarios early in the new year \nwhich, based on your suggestion, we have further update with AI specific scenarios. We will send an calendar invite \nwhen we have finished workshopping with our EIAT colleagues. \n\nIt’s been a busy year for all of us (for slightly different reasons!), but we’re keen to get some further insights and \ninformation about these items to help us prepare for the next federal election. \n\nPlease let me know if you would prefer to discuss or would like further information or context. \n\nKind regards, \n\n| Assistant Director  \n\nDefending Democracy Unit | Electoral Integrity and Media Branch \nAustralian Electoral Commission \nPhone: \n\n | DDU Group Line: \n\n | Protected email: \n\n3\n\ns47Fs47Fs47Fs47Fs47Fs47Fs47Fs47Fs47Fs47Fs47Fs47Fs47Fs47E  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n\fFrom: \nSent: Monday, 13 May 2024 2:52 PM \nTo: Tom Rogers \n\n; Jeff Pope \n\nMichael Lynch \nCc:\nSubject: Re: Meta follow-up \n\n Matthew Haigh \n\nCAUTION: This email originated from outside of the Australian Federal Government.

As we have \nclarity on the timing of the next federal election, we look forward to establishing more regular \nengagements and scenario planning to ensure both of our teams are ready to liaise in relation to emerging \nissues. \n\nWe appreciate that there has been a greater adoption of Generative AI tools in today's society and we look \nforward to working with the AEC and other stakeholders on the potential challenges that they may \npresent. In case it is of interest, I’ve attached our submission to the Department of Industry’s Safe and \nResponsible AI consultation last year. At Meta, we have been working on AI for over a decade and “classic \nAI” is a key part of our content governance and security systems. Additionally, content that has been \ncreated or altered using AI is still subject to our content policies and fact checking initiative.  \n\nThat said, we recognise that new policies and approaches are needed as the use of GenAI becomes more \nwidespread. Since we filed our submission late last year, we have made a number of announcements that \nmay be of interest to you: \n\n4\n\ns47Fs47Fs47Fs47Fs47Fs47Fs47Fs47Fs47Fs47Fs47F \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f  Adjustments to manipulated media policy: in response to feedback from the Oversight Board, we announced changes \nto how we handle manipulated media. The Board recommended that we broaden the scope of our manipulated media \npolicy, but stop removing manipulated media that do not otherwise violate our Community Standards. \nLabeling AI-generated Images: we have been working with industry to develop both visible markers and invisible labels \nand metadata on images generated by AI tools. \n\n \n\n  AI Ad Disclosure policy: we’ve introduced new disclosure requirements for advertisers using AI or digital methods in \n\nsocial, electoral, or political ads. \n\nAs you may have seen, we are also one of the companies that signed up to the Tech Accord to Combat \nDeceptive Use of AI in 2024 Elections is a set of commitments to deploy technology countering harmful AI-\ngenerated content meant to deceive voters. \n\nAnd in relation to media literacy campaigns and how we measure success, as we mentioned, ahead of the \nVoice  Referendum,  we partnered  with  Australian  Associated  Press  (AAP)  to  launch  a  new media  literacy \ncampaign that shared tips and advice with people so that they could make informed decisions about what \nthey read, trust and share. The campaign videos (examples here and here) were scripted and shot by AAP \nFactCheck journalists and aimed to generate awareness of tactics used to spread mis- and disinformation \nand by driving audiences to check the facts via the AAP Fact Check website. The campaign ran for six weeks \nwith a combined reach on Facebook and Instagram in Australia of over 10 million users, creating over 40 \nmillion impressions.  \n\nThe latest EU campaign that you mentioned is currently being finalised in partnership with the European \nFact-Checking Standards Network and specifically aims to raise public awareness of how to spot AI-\ngenerated and digitally altered content. The campaign is scheduled to launch ahead of the 2024 EU \nParliament Elections next month and will comprise a number of infographics and an explainer video. We \ncan share details of the campaign’s reach and engagement with you when this information becomes \navailable.  \n\nFinally, please let us know if it would be helpful for us to arrange a virtual briefing with our colleague \ndirector on our security policy team, for a more detailed briefing about security trends and issues we’re seeing globally. \n\n, a \n\nKind regards,  \n\n--  \nRegional Director of Policy | Australia, Japan, Korea, New Zealand & Pacific Islands \nM: \n\n | E: \n\nDISCLAIMER: \n\nIf you have received this transmission in error please notify us immediately by return email and delete all \ncopies.

I’m writing regarding recent ABC reporting relating to five Facebook pages said to \nhave been linked to Russian foreign interference in the UK election. I understand these pages have since been taken \ndown by Meta for inauthentic behaviour.  \n\nWhile the material posted was not reported to have received a significant amount of authentic engagement, \nincidents like this present an opportunity for us to learn from real-life events around the world. In order for the AEC \nto consider how we can best prepare ourselves ahead of our next federal election, we are interested in \nunderstanding more about the following: \n\n- We understand that advanced persistent threat (APT) actors will adapt their tactics and change profiles. How is \nMeta dealing with this challenge? Is it anticipated that limitations in detection methods may mean similar material \ngoes undetected in future? \n- When Meta was made aware of the existence of the pages? \n- What steps were involved between being made aware of the pages and their takedown, and how long this took? \n- Whether there were other pages linked to the same network that have also been uncovered and actioned since? \n- Whether the ads review process detected any paid ads from these pages? \n- Whether elections operations centres include team members who specialise in detecting coordinated inauthentic \nbehaviour and counter covert influence operations ahead of electoral events? \n- If there is any further information linking these pages to Russia (beyond the pro-Russian messaging and that \nNigeria is a known base of operations for Russian-linked influence efforts)? \n\nHaving a more fulsome understanding of Meta’s approach to this type of scenario will be very helpful for us to know \nhow best to respond in the event something similar occurs here during our next election. \n\nWe’d be happy to discuss, if needed, and look forward to hearing from you. \n\nRegards \n\nMatt \n\nMatthew Haigh | Assistant Commissioner, Electoral Integrity and Media Branch (CISO & CRO) \nAustralian Electoral Commission  \n X: \n\n M: \n\nE: \n\n for PROTECTED material \n\nDISCLAIMER: \n\nIf you have received this transmission in error please notify us immediately by return email and delete all \ncopies.
