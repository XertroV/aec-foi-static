It concerns an AEC request for content restriction of specific URLs on YouTube. Google/YouTube reviewed the request but declined to restrict the content, stating they \"didn't find grounds to restrict the URL(s) at issue under our legal policies,\" and suggested the AEC pursue direct resolution with content creators or legal action.\n\n**Relevance to FOI Request (LEX3037):** This correspondence is a direct example of the \"extensive communication\" and \"direct communication channels and content referrals\" between the AEC and major tech companies, specifically Google, as described in the FOI request overview. It demonstrates the AEC's proactive engagement through its Electoral Integrity Assurance Taskforce during the 2022 federal election to address potential non-compliant content, even when a content removal request is not successful. This exchange illustrates the practical application of the AEC's efforts to identify, monitor, and address electoral integrity issues with platform partners.\n```"
