  "prompt": "Considering this document as part of an FOI request, summarize the document and its relevance to the FOI request in markdown format. FYI the overview of the FOI request is: FOI request LEX7939 sought statistical data from the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) on \"designated electors,\" including their overall numbers, new declarations, and associated review processes. While the current total number of designated electors was referenced as available on their website rather than directly provided, the AEC reported 211 new declarations in FY2024/25 to date, a notable increase from previous years, with all declarations made by a delegate of the Electoral Commissioner. The request also revealed a small number of internal review applications (four in FY2022/23 and four in FY2024/25), predominantly resulting in confirmed decisions, though one was set aside in FY2024/25. No applications for review to the Administrative Review Tribunal or instances of declarations ceasing effect under s 202AH(3) were recorded for the specified periods.\n\nDocument Text:\n\nLEX7939  \n\nFOI Request LEX7939 â€“ Designated Electors Data  \n\nI seek access to the following, as at the close of rolls 7 April 2025: \n\n1.
