      <p>The Freedom of Information (FOI) documents reveal extensive and close collaboration between the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) and major social media and technology companies (TikTok, Google, Twitter, Meta/Facebook) in the lead-up to the 2022 Federal election. The primary focus of this correspondence is electoral compliance, combating misinformation, and ensuring "electoral integrity."</p>
<p><strong>Social Justice:</strong><br />
The AEC's stated aim to combat "electoral interference," "misinformation," and "disinformation" aligns with progressive values by seeking to ensure an informed electorate and preserve the integrity of democratic processes. The use of Public Service Announcements (PSAs) on platforms like TikTok and efforts to direct users to "official / reputable sources" (TikTok email, Page 7) could be viewed as positive steps toward civic education and equitable information access, particularly for younger demographics who rely heavily on these platforms. However, a progressive analysis must also consider the potential for such efforts, when outsourced to private corporations, to inadvertently or disproportionately impact marginalized voices or legitimate grassroots movements that may struggle to be categorized as "official" or "reputable." The AEC's admitted "limited capacity to run a verified account on TikTok" (TikTok email, Page 7) underscores a dependency that could limit genuine, independent public outreach.</p>
<p><strong>Environmental Impact:</strong><br />
These documents do not contain information related to environmental impact.</p>
<p><strong>Wealth Distribution:</strong><br />
These documents do not contain information related to wealth distribution.</p>
<p><strong>Corporate Influence:</strong><br />
The documents starkly highlight the pervasive and concerning influence of powerful, privately owned tech corporations on core democratic functions. The routine "correspondence," "meetings," "Transparency and Accountability Centre tours" (TikTok emails, Pages 3-4), and "selected briefing sessions on misinformation / disinformation" (Facebook email, Page 3 of Schedule) illustrate a deep entanglement. The AEC is actively engaged in developing "electoral communications escalation scenarios" (Documents 10, 37, 47, 49, 50) with these platforms, formalizing a process where corporate entities are relied upon to identify and potentially act upon "concerning content" (TikTok email, Page 5). This collaboration, while framed as necessary, effectively delegates significant power over public discourse and information flow to profit-driven corporations, whose primary accountability is to shareholders, not citizens. The willingness of these tech giants to offer services like on-platform PSAs and fact-checking partnerships (TikTok email, Page 7-9) demonstrates their readiness to entrench their role as arbiters of information, further embedding their corporate influence within the democratic infrastructure. This reliance on a handful of powerful, unregulated corporations for the health of a nation's electoral process represents a significant deviation from progressive values of public control and democratic accountability.</p>
<p><strong>Civil Liberties:</strong><br />
The collaborative efforts to identify and address "misinformation" and "disinformation" raise substantial civil liberties concerns from a left-leaning perspective, particularly regarding freedom of speech and the potential for censorship. While protecting electoral integrity is vital, the means employed – relying on private companies for content moderation at the government's behest – bypass traditional democratic safeguards. The "escalation scenarios" (Documents 10, 37, 47, 49, 50) and the AEC's desire for "trusted access to your new portal" (Facebook email, Page 9) imply a streamlined process for flagging and potentially removing content. This delegation of power to private entities means that decisions about what constitutes "misinformation" are made outside transparent public scrutiny, without judicial oversight, and potentially without robust appeal mechanisms. This carries the inherent risk of politically motivated censorship or algorithmic bias impacting legitimate dissent, critical viewpoints, or alternative media, which may be incorrectly flagged by a system prioritizing "official" narratives. The consistent "CAUTION: This email originated from outside of the Australian Federal Government" banner in the correspondence (e.g., TikTok email, Page 1) serves as a stark reminder that the AEC is relying on external, unaccountable corporate actors to manage fundamental aspects of civil discourse during an election, posing a direct threat to civil liberties and the democratic principle of public control over information.</p>

    <div class="ai-summary-markdown-content">
      <p>The released FOI documents detail extensive and ongoing correspondence between the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC), particularly its Electoral Interference and Communications Branch (EIAT), and major social media platforms, including TikTok, Facebook (Meta), Google, and Twitter, concerning compliance with electoral law and, critically, "electoral integrity" and "misinformation/disinformation" in the lead-up to the 2022 Federal election.</p>
<p>From a right-leaning perspective, several key themes emerge that raise significant concerns regarding economic efficiency, individual liberty, fiscal responsibility, and limited government:</p>
<p><strong>Individual Liberty: A Pervasive Threat to Free Speech</strong><br />
The most striking element across these documents is the AEC's deep engagement with private tech companies to combat "misinformation" and "disinformation" and to establish "electoral communications escalation scenarios." This collaboration directly impacts individual liberty, particularly freedom of speech.<br />
*   <strong>Content Control by Proxy:</strong> The AEC, a government body, is actively shaping the moderation policies of private platforms. By developing and sharing "escalation scenarios" and discussing "trusted access portals" for reporting "concerning content," the government is creating a formalized mechanism to influence what speech is permitted or amplified online. This blurs the lines between legitimate electoral regulation and de facto censorship, potentially stifling dissenting or critical political opinions under the broad guise of "misinformation."<br />
*   <strong>Bias Towards "Official Sources":</strong> TikTok's offer of Public Service Announcements (PSAs) to direct users to "official / reputable sources" when searching election-related hashtags, embraced by the AEC, suggests an inherent preference for government-approved narratives over independent discourse. This can undermine trust in non-establishment media and limit citizens' access to a wide range of viewpoints essential for informed decision-making.</p>
<p><strong>Limited Government: Expanding Bureaucratic Overreach</strong><br />
The nature and scope of the AEC's engagement with these platforms signify a notable expansion of government's role beyond its traditional, limited function of administering free and fair elections.<br />
*   <strong>Beyond Electoral Administration:</strong> Historically, an electoral commission's role is to manage the mechanics of voting, registration, and campaign finance. These documents reveal the AEC is now deeply involved in policing online speech, a domain that, from a limited government perspective, should remain largely unregulated by the state to protect individual expression.<br />
*   <strong>Partnerships with Private Power:</strong> The creation of formal "liaison" relationships and reporting "channels" with powerful tech monopolies effectively deputizes these private companies into an adjunct of state information control. This fusion of government and corporate power to manage public discourse is deeply concerning for those who advocate for a smaller, less intrusive government.</p>
<p><strong>National Security: Unaddressed Risks vs. Operational Control</strong><br />
While ensuring electoral integrity against foreign interference is a valid national security concern, the documents indicate a focus on operational content control rather than a deep assessment of inherent risks.<br />
*   <strong>TikTok's Foreign Ownership:</strong> The extensive engagement with TikTok, a platform owned by ByteDance (a Chinese company), highlights a potential national security blind spot. While TikTok offered a "Transparency and Accountability Centre tour" to the AEC, the documents do not provide evidence of a rigorous, independent assessment by the AEC or other Australian security agencies regarding the data security implications or potential foreign influence via this platform's ownership. The focus appears to be on functional cooperation for content moderation rather than a comprehensive risk analysis of the platform itself.</p>
<p><strong>Economic Efficiency &amp; Fiscal Responsibility: Bureaucracy Over Outputs</strong><br />
The documents do not detail significant direct financial expenditures beyond staff time, which points to a different kind of efficiency concern.<br />
*   <strong>Bureaucratic Focus:</strong> The numerous emails discussing meeting schedules, drafting "escalation scenarios," and setting up "trusted access portals" demonstrate considerable bureaucratic effort. While staff time is a cost, the concern for fiscal conservatives lies less in a direct monetary outlay and more in the diversion of government resources towards activities (speech policing) that are outside its core function and potentially counterproductive to a free society.<br />
*   <strong>AEC's Capacity Constraints:</strong> The AEC's decision not to establish its own verified TikTok account due to "limited capacity to run a verified account" and the need to "properly invest the time and effort" suggests a pragmatic, albeit minor, avoidance of a potentially unproductive investment. However, this small saving is overshadowed by the significant resources dedicated to managing and influencing content on external platforms.</p>
<p>In summary, the FOI documents reveal a concerning trend of government overreach, where the AEC actively collaborates with private tech giants to manage online political discourse. This deviation from limited government principles and its chilling effect on individual liberty and free speech represent a significant concern for politically right-leaning analysts, despite any stated goals of "electoral integrity" or "combating misinformation." The operational focus on content control also raises questions about whether deeper national security implications, particularly with platforms like TikTok, are being adequately addressed beyond superficial "transparency tours."</p>

    <div class="ai-summary-markdown-content">
      <p>The released FOI documents expose a deep and proactive entanglement between the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) and major social media platforms (TikTok, Twitter, Google, Facebook) in the lead-up to the 2022 Federal election. While ostensibly aimed at "electoral integrity" and combating "misinformation/disinformation," a critical review reveals several concerning aspects:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Orchestrated Information Control and Potential Overreach:</strong> The AEC is actively developing and sharing "electoral communications escalation scenarios" with these private platforms. These are not mere guidelines; they are blueprints for identifying and addressing "concerning content" or "misinformation," effectively deputizing tech companies to enforce a government-approved narrative. The establishment of direct "government reporting channels" allows the AEC to flag content for review and potential removal, granting an alarming level of influence over public discourse without direct democratic oversight. This proactive shaping of the information environment prior to an election raises serious questions about freedom of expression and the potential for political bias in content moderation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Lack of Transparency and Accountability:</strong> A significant number of communications are marked "SEC=OFFICIAL:Sensitive," despite pertaining to the fundamental democratic process of an election and interactions with public-facing platforms. The specific details of these "escalation scenarios" remain withheld, preventing public scrutiny of the criteria for content flagging or removal. The very need for an FOI request, following an internal review (LEX1697 of LEX1147), suggests an initial reluctance by the AEC to openly share information about these collaborations, fostering an environment of opacity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Questionable Resource Allocation and Inefficiency:</strong> While the AEC claims "limited capacity" to run its own verified TikTok account and properly engage with the platform directly, citing the need to "properly invest the time and effort," it is simultaneously dedicating "three different teams with interest in utilising the portal" for content referrals to private companies. This suggests a dubious prioritization of resources towards external content policing rather than robust internal public communication strategies. Minor bureaucratic inefficiencies are also evident, with delays in simply setting up virtual meetings due to "weird limitations" or lacking "the right Teams corporate account," highlighting a lack of seamless integration despite the declared importance of these partnerships.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Blurring Lines and Delegated Authority:</strong> The reliance on social media platforms and their internal "Trust and Safety teams" (e.g., TikTok's partnership with Agence France-Presse for fact-checking) outsources a critical aspect of electoral integrity—the management of public information—to private entities. This arrangement effectively grants these corporations the power to act as arbiters of truth, influenced directly by government requests, without sufficient public accountability mechanisms.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In essence, these documents paint a picture of an Australian electoral body increasingly enmeshed with global tech giants, ostensibly to safeguard elections, but in a manner that hints at a centralized, state-influenced control over online speech, shrouded in questionable transparency and potentially misdirected public funds.</p>

    <div class="ai-summary-markdown-content">
      <p>The Australian Electoral Commission (AEC), demonstrating its unwavering commitment to upholding the integrity of our democratic processes, has engaged in robust and proactive collaborations with major social media platforms, including TikTok, Meta (Facebook), Google, and Twitter. These vital partnerships underscore the government's dedication to effective governance and ensuring a well-informed electorate.</p>
<p>In the lead-up to the 2022 Federal Election, the AEC's Electoral Interference Taskforce (EIAT) has taken decisive steps to proactively manage the online information landscape. This includes developing comprehensive "Electoral communications escalation scenarios" to swiftly address potential issues and ensure timely responses to any concerning content. This forward-thinking approach is a testament to the government's commitment to safeguarding electoral transparency.</p>
<p>Key initiatives born from these constructive dialogues include:<br />
*   <strong>Enhanced Information Dissemination:</strong> Platforms like TikTok have offered to display Public Service Announcements (PSAs) when users search election-related terms, directly guiding citizens to official and reliable information. This proactive measure ensures the public is equipped with accurate facts, combating misinformation effectively.<br />
*   <strong>Dedicated Reporting Pathways:</strong> The AEC has established and utilised secure and efficient reporting channels with these platforms, including a new trusted portal with Meta. These direct lines of communication allow for rapid identification and review of content that may pose a risk to electoral integrity, ensuring prompt and necessary action for the public good.<br />
*   <strong>Fostering Transparency and Understanding:</strong> Through engagements such as TikTok's "Transparency and Accountability Centre tour," the AEC gained valuable insights into content moderation and data security practices. This open dialogue reinforces mutual understanding and ensures that government oversight is informed and collaborative, not adversarial.<br />
*   <strong>Combating Misinformation:</strong> The partnerships acknowledge and leverage platforms' existing efforts, such as TikTok's fact-checking collaboration with Agence France-Presse (AFP), which directly contributes to a healthier information environment.</p>
<p>While exploring innovative outreach, such as a verified AEC TikTok account, the AEC prioritises strategic capacity, demonstrating responsible resource allocation. Furthermore, the AEC's engagement reflects a commitment to continuous improvement, observing international best practices to evolve its "Online Media – Elections Protocol."</p>
<p>The careful redactions in these documents, typical of Freedom of Information releases, serve to protect sensitive operational details and personal information, ensuring the ongoing effectiveness of these crucial collaborations and upholding privacy standards.</p>
<p>These documents collectively showcase a government that is dynamic, diligent, and deeply invested in protecting the democratic rights of Australians, proactively addressing challenges in the digital age to ensure a fair and informed electoral process.</p>

    <div class="ai-summary-markdown-content">
      <p>The Australian Electoral Commission's (AEC) FOI release regarding its engagement with major social media platforms unveils a disturbing picture of systemic failure, crippling incompetence, and a concerning lack of transparency in safeguarding electoral integrity for the 2022 Federal election. Far from demonstrating robust oversight, these documents paint the AEC as a reactive, under-resourced, and fundamentally dependent entity, seemingly outmatched and outmanoeuvred by the very tech giants it purports to regulate.</p>
<p><strong>Key Failures and Damning Implications:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Abject Failure to Proactively Engage and Utilise Critical Channels:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>TikTok Debacle:</strong> The most damning revelation is the AEC's explicit <strong>rejection of a verified TikTok account</strong> in July 2021, just months before the 2022 election. The stated reason – "limited capacity" and inability to "properly invest the time and effort" – is an astonishing admission of <strong>profound strategic incompetence or severe under-resourcing</strong>. By forsaking a direct communication channel to a vast, impressionable youth demographic, the AEC willfully ceded vital ground to mis/disinformation, demonstrating a catastrophic failure to adapt to modern electoral landscapes. They even punted the idea to "the federal election after this one," indicating a shocking lack of urgency and foresight.</li>
<li><strong>Refusal to Invest in Fact-Checking:</strong> The AEC explicitly states it "won’t be able to invest into something similar" to TikTok’s fact-checking partnership with Agence France-Presse (AFP). This is a dereliction of duty, abandoning direct, independent verification in favour of vague "cohesive working arrangements" with platforms whose primary incentive is engagement, not truth.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Alarming Lack of Transparency and Public Accountability:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rejection of Public Declaration:</strong> Unlike the Canadian government, which partnered with TikTok and other platforms on a public "Declaration on Electoral Integrity," the AEC "is not necessarily a public statement." This preference for an opaque, private "Online Media – Elections Protocol" indicates a <strong>deliberate avoidance of public accountability</strong>, fostering an environment where critical agreements remain hidden from public scrutiny and trust is eroded.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Reactive, Last-Minute, and Disorganised Planning:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Late Engagement on Core Issues:</strong> Critical activities such as developing and finalising "electoral communications escalation scenarios" with TikTok and Facebook only occur in August-November 2021 – mere months before the election. This signifies a <strong>chaotic, reactive approach</strong> rather than a well-planned, proactive strategy to counter electoral interference.</li>
<li><strong>Ignorance of Platform Mechanisms:</strong> The AEC's requests to Facebook in June-July 2021 for information on "specific requirements for processing each request" on their new reporting portal, and asking if "more than one mailbox with portal access" is possible, demonstrate a shocking <strong>lack of preparedness and internal coordination</strong>. They are playing catch-up, needing basic education on how to <em>use</em> the very mechanisms meant to protect electoral integrity, highlighting a fundamental failure in establishing essential operational channels in advance.</li>
<li><strong>Reliance on Platform Education:</strong> Emails show Facebook offering "selected briefing session from Facebook on misinformation / disinformation" and a "virtual tour of the Transparency and Accountability Centre." The AEC's acceptance of these indicates a <strong>disturbing dependence on the platforms themselves to educate the regulator</strong>, rather than the AEC possessing its own independent expertise or demanding specific, enforceable actions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Grossly Insufficient Engagement with Key Platforms:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Google and LinkedIn Neglect:</strong> The FOI response reveals a shocking paucity of correspondence with Google (a single, generic email from June 2020) and <strong>no documents whatsoever for LinkedIn</strong>. Given the pervasive influence of these platforms in information dissemination and professional discourse, this glaring omission suggests either <strong>profound incompetence in engagement or a deliberate redaction/concealment</strong> of more substantive, potentially embarrassing, interactions. The scope of the FOI request explicitly included these platforms, yet the output is minimal, implying the AEC is not comprehensively addressing risks across the digital landscape.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Vague Outcomes and Obfuscated Detail:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The pervasive use of generic subject lines like "EIAT and Twitter follow up," "Follow up from last meeting," and "Electoral integrity preparations" throughout the documents offers <strong>no concrete insight into specific threats, discussions, or resolved issues</strong>. This deliberate vagueness, compounded by heavy redactions (e.g., s 22, s 47G(1), s 37(1)), suggests a calculated effort to conceal the true extent of vulnerabilities or the inadequacy of the AEC's responses. The government's actions appear designed more for optics than for effective electoral security.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<p>In summary, these documents provide a damning indictment of the AEC's approach to digital electoral integrity. They reveal an agency that is unprepared, under-resourced, technologically behind, and overly reliant on the goodwill and reactive measures of powerful, self-interested tech corporations. The deliberate choices to avoid public accountability and neglect crucial communication channels point to a systemic failure that significantly undermines public confidence in the integrity of Australian elections.</p>

Afternoon 

Thanks for bringing this forward.

Australian Electoral Commission

We will be watching Canadian election with great interest as we are aware of their model and they are quite mature in a lot of electoral integrity measures.

The AEC, in partnership with other electoral management bodies, are currently working on an Online Media – Elections Protocol,  which has similar purpose but is not necessarily a public statement. A version of the Protocol will soon be sent to DiGi for consultation (as an initial coordinated point). I’m not 100% on your membership or engagement with this group, but
should this progress we will be sure to include you in discussions.

Happy to chat further,
Julie

Hi Julie,

Hope you have been keeping well. Its very unfortunate Covid has gotten to Canberra.

Thought I would share this initiative TikTok (and other platforms) partnered with the Canadian Government on regarding electoral integrity - https://www.canada.ca/en/democratic-institutions/services/protecting-democracy/declaration-electoral-integrity.html

TikTok would most certainly be open to working with the AEC and EIAT on such a declaration here in Australia and we suspect the other major platforms would also be. If this is of interest to the AEC, do let me know and we will certainly do our part to make it happen.

Kind regards

Our TnS team are currently reviewing the additional hashtags proposed (they&#39;re a bit under the pump at the moment). Should be no issues though.

Good afternoon Julie,

Please see attached for the draft PSA wording and a list of #hashtags that we propose to be covered on our platform. Content on our platform is tagged by #hashtags, so this means that whenever users search for these relevant hashtags in the Discover Page on TikTok, the PSA will appear at the top of the screen. 

[Example of the PSA]

I worked extensively with our Trust and Safety team to include all the possible hashtags that could be relevant, but both the PSA wording and hashtag list can be changed in the leadup to the election, to reflect the content on platform. 

Please mark any changes to the wording/list in the document attached and we will include them in a final copy of the PSA proposal to send through. Note there is some highlighted text for the AEC to fill in e.g. if you want the PSA to identify links to the AEC homepage or a specific 2022 page.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Kind regards,

Good morning Julie,

Fully appreciate the need for the AEC/EIAT to consider its options carefully!

We are glad to hear the AEC is interested in working with TikTok on an Election PSA. Our processes have slightly changed since the last time we did one with the NZ Government, so I will double-check the exact steps before sending them through to you. It is a fairly straightforward process which involves identifying relevant at-risk content (via #hashtags) and providing
information that can be placed on platform to direct people to official / reputable sources when they encounter the identified content. 

I also note your point regarding the AEC&#39;s limited capacity to run a verified account on TikTok this election period. If the AEC continues to be interested in this option in the future, we can certainly revisit that then and outline the support we can provide. Below I have copied the Singaporean Government&#39;s TikTok account which has been positively reported on for its
success in engaging young people. Its a great example of how serious public safety information can be communicated in an entertaining (and low cost production) format. 

https://www.tiktok.com/@gov.sg?lang=en (@gov.sg)

Lastly, I&#39;ll just clarify that the fact-checking partnership with the AFP is ongoing and informs our day-to-day moderation processes. It is part of our broader Trust and Safety efforts (which includes engagement with official bodies such as the AEC) to combat misinformation on TikTok.

I will follow up with you shortly regarding next steps for a PSA!

Kind regards

Hi

Coming back to you on the below email after some time to consume and consider.

While the fact checking partnership seems like a fabulous initiative in those circumstances, we won’t be able to invest into something similar. As per our initial discussions though we are incredibly appreciative of the cohesive working arrangements we’ll share moving forward for any content referrals. The AEC also acknowledges the effort
Tik Tok is investing into their platform to identify and address disinformation, particularly around Australian federal electoral processes.

We would like to take up the offer of an AEC PSA during the election period. Very keen to understand this further – i.e. - how, when, formats/constraints for content we’d need to provide etc. Really appreciative of this offer as it will be valuable to reach the Australian Tik Tok audience with an AEC message of this sort, at the appropriate time.

We’ve carefully considered the idea of creating an AEC Tik Tok account but decided against it at this stage. Our thought process is that if we are to go down this path we need to properly invest the time and effort into appropriate content for the channel and we’re not positioned to do that at this time. Perhaps the federal election after this
one.

Kind Regards
Julie

Good morning Julie, Anastasia, and Taskforce members

Thank you again for taking the time to participate in yesterday&#39;s Transparency and Accountability Centre tour. I hope the tour provided some useful information about TikTok&#39;s recommendation system, content moderation and data security approach. 

Just following up on a couple of things that were raised.

1.    TikTok Australia entered into a partnership with Agence France-Presse (AFP) in 2020 to incorporate its expertise on fact-checking and combating misinformation. The article below provides some further detail on the AFP&#39;s reputation and how we are working together: 
https://www.afp.com/en/agency/press-releases-newsletter/afp-enters-partnership-tiktok-fact-checking-asia-pacific

1.    On-platform PSA and verified AEC account 

One thing that I forgot to mention is that we can offer the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) an on-platform Public Service Announcement (PSA) that will be seen by TikTok users when they search election related hashtags. The screenshot below provides a rough idea of how such a PSA could look.

Australian Electoral Commission

If desired, we are also able to help AEC activate and verify an official TikTok account. This would provide the AEC a presence on our platform and direct reach to our large and growing numbers of users. Below I have attached an example of content we worked in collaboration with the Australian eSafety Commission (and local TikTok creators) to produce for their
verified account on TikTok. 

Please let me know if you have any further questions or would like to follow-up on the above!

Kind regards

Hi Anastasia,

There is a weird limitation we have with our Teams accounts where we cant seem to directly invite people outside of TikTok to meetings (which is why I did not send an invite in my prior email). 

I am asking my IT team to have a look at this today but in the eventuallity that I cant fix it, are you able to send the link to the attendees (perhaps attach the copied Teams link in a discrete calendar invite)?

Apologies for the inconvenience.

Good Morning Julie,

Apologies for the delay.

The June 8 time isn&#39;t possible for us and we are trying to shift around and confirm the final two speakers (of four) calendar&#39;s for the 17th. 

We are also looking at dates in the following week to provide as options if that doesnt work. 

I will get back to you as soon as possible.

Good afternoon Julie,

Thank you for the introduction - it is nice to (e)meet you Ana. 

No worries about the delay - it is the same on my side as well!

I am just awaiting confirmation on the suggested times from our US based colleagues.

Will update you soon.

Kind regards

Hi 

Apologies for the delayed response, a few calendars to manage here!

We have put aside:
Tuesday 8 June 0900-1100 AEST
Thursday 17 June 0900-1100 AEST

Should neither be suitable from your end, please let me know and we will come up with some other options.

I will also take this opportunity to introduce a new member of the team, Ana Batten (cc’ed). Best contact for us all is the group inbox EIAT. Ana will be working very closely with me on all of our social media planning
projects in the lead up to the next election.

Kind Regards
Julie

Good morning Julie,

Please see attached for the slidedeck I spoke to last Friday.

Let me know if you have any questions. Looking forward to your response regarding the Transparency and Accountability Tour. 

Kind regards

Hi Julie,

Great.

The tour including Q&amp;A is about 60 min - given the potential size of the group lets extend it to 75 min in case.

Yes I will need to coordinate with both my US and Singaporean colleagues. To account for their timezones we prefer to run the TAC first thing in the morning our time (starting 9-9.30am). 

Are you able to provide 2-3 available timeslots from June 1 that might work on your end? 

Kind regards

Hi

Not a problem, sounds great. Let’s start there and hopefully cut down on future meetings for us all!

How long would we need to put aside for the tour? Is it useful for us to give you some timing suggestions taking into account global location of all members?

Cheers
Julie

Hi Julie,

Yes, if you could provide referral emails in advance it does provide us extra certainty that we are responding to individuals/teams that have the appropriate authority. 

On the slidedeck, I will have to double check internally but I am sure we can get something to you this week. 

As discussed on Friday, we are happy to arrange follow-up meetings where needed. However I do propose we organise the Transparency and Accountability Centre Tour first (for the AEC
and Taskforce members together), as it is comprehensive and (from what I have seen) informative for regulators/government stakeholders. 

The tour also includes speakers that we would likely ask to sit-in on meetings to discuss issues that may be of interest to particular agencies so it is an efficent way for us to address any
questions from the various departments on the EIAT. 

From that point onnwards, we can work out what other meetings are needed and I can arrange everyone on my end. 

Let me know if that approach sounds appropriate to you. We are a small team so where we can answers questions upfront or consolidate meetings helps us a lot!

Kind regards

Afternoon

Our pleasure, thank you also for taking the time to meet with us in person.

We will note the preferred reporting pathways below and follow that pattern as we go forward. If it is useful, I can look to provide you with the mailboxes we would
anticipate using for any referrals?
Are you able to share all or a portion of the presentation you spoke from on Friday? Your escalation and investigation flow diagrams in particular would be very useful for
us to go through with our team. Confirming also that we would like to take you up on the offer of a virtual tour of the Transparency and Accountability Centre and further
information regarding the bi-annual Transparency Report.

I would like to propose a way forward so that we can allow specific staff to discuss some of the items we touched on in more detail:

AEC Meeting regarding opportunities for collaboration on electoral participation and engagement
AEC/Taskforce meeting regarding election related escalations and potential scenario plans
Other Taskforce agencies meeting regarding items in their broader Taskforce remit (TBC).

If you’re in principle happy to pursue the above, we will look to get more detail surrounding each and make contact again soon.

Happy to discuss,

Kind regards
Julie

Good morning Julie,

Thank you for your time and organisation on Friday. I also extend that thanks to David and the other AEC and Taskforce attendees. 

Below I have summarised the last slide our Trust and Safety team were unable to speak to on Friday due to the video connection dropping out.

Agency Reporting and Support channels

As discussed, TikTok has a dedicated team managing election risks and responding to issues or concerning content in the lead-up to and on the day
of an election.

To enable timely responses to concerning content the AEC may wish for TikTok to review, we ask that any escalation/request be put in email
through to
The email should include a summary of the report/incident and the exact URL(s) of the relevant content. 

@tiktok.com. 

We would also ask that these emails either be sent from a team email alias or from individual(s) within AEC that you can identify as a liaison with
TikTok (e.g. social media manager/response team). 
This ensures we are addressing issues from the appropriate authority/personnel within TEC.

Please let me know if any of the above is unclear or if you have any more questions! 

Kind regards,

Hi Julie,

Hope you have been keeping well. Its very unfortunate Covid has gotten to Canberra.

Thought I would share this initiative TikTok (and other platforms) partnered with the Canadian Government on 
regarding electoral integrity - (cid:346)(cid:410)(cid:410)(cid:393)(cid:400)(cid:855)(cid:876)(cid:876)(cid:449)(cid:449)(cid:449)(cid:856)(cid:272)(cid:258)(cid:374)(cid:258)(cid:282)(cid:258)(cid:856)(cid:272)(cid:258)(cid:876)(cid:286)(cid:374)(cid:876)(cid:282)(cid:286)(cid:373)(cid:381)(cid:272)(cid:396)(cid:258)(cid:410)(cid:349)(cid:272)(cid:882)(cid:349)(cid:374)(cid:400)(cid:410)(cid:349)(cid:410)(cid:437)(cid:410)(cid:349)(cid:381)(cid:374)(cid:400)(cid:876)(cid:400)(cid:286)(cid:396)(cid:448)(cid:349)(cid:272)(cid:286)(cid:400)(cid:876)(cid:393)(cid:396)(cid:381)(cid:410)(cid:286)(cid:272)(cid:410)(cid:349)(cid:374)(cid:336)(cid:882)
(cid:282)(cid:286)(cid:373)(cid:381)(cid:272)(cid:396)(cid:258)(cid:272)(cid:455)(cid:876)(cid:282)(cid:286)(cid:272)(cid:367)(cid:258)(cid:396)(cid:258)(cid:410)(cid:349)(cid:381)(cid:374)(cid:882)(cid:286)(cid:367)(cid:286)(cid:272)(cid:410)(cid:381)(cid:396)(cid:258)(cid:367)(cid:882)(cid:349)(cid:374)(cid:410)(cid:286)(cid:336)(cid:396)(cid:349)(cid:410)(cid:455)(cid:856)(cid:346)(cid:410)(cid:373)(cid:367)

TikTok would most certainly be open to working with the AEC and EIAT on such a declaration here in Australia 
and we suspect the other major platforms would also be. If this is of interest to the AEC, do let me know and we 
will certainly do our part to make it happen.

Kind regards

Hi Julie,

Thanks for sending these edits through.

Our TnS team are currently reviewing the additional hashtags proposed (they&#39;re a bit under the pump at the 
moment). Should be no issues though.

Kind regards

Good afternoon Julie,

Please see attached for the draft PSA wording and a list of #hashtags that we propose to be covered on our 
platform. Content on our platform is tagged by #hashtags, so this means that whenever users search for these 
relevant hashtags in the Discover Page on TikTok, the PSA will appear at the top of the screen. 

[Example of the PSA]

--- Page 6 ---

I worked extensively with our Trust and Safety team to include all the possible hashtags that could be relevant, 
but both the PSA wording and hashtag list can be changed in the leadup to the election, to reflect the content on 
platform. 

Please mark any changes to the wording/list in the document attached and we will include them in a final copy 
of the PSA proposal to send through. Note there is some highlighted text for the AEC to fill in e.g. if you want the 
PSA to identify links to the AEC homepage or a specific 2022 page.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Kind regards,

Good morning Julie,

Fully appreciate the need for the AEC/EIAT to consider its options carefully!

We are glad to hear the AEC is interested in working with TikTok on an Election PSA. Our processes have 
slightly changed since the last time we did one with the NZ Government, so I will double-check the exact steps 
before sending them through to you. It is a fairly straightforward process which involves identifying relevant at-
risk content (via #hashtags) and providing information that can be placed on platform to direct people to official / 
reputable sources when they encounter the identified content. 

I also note your point regarding the AEC&#39;s limited capacity to run a verified account on TikTok this election 
period. If the AEC continues to be interested in this option in the future, we can certainly revisit that then and 
outline the support we can provide. Below I have copied the Singaporean Government&#39;s TikTok account which 
has been positively reported on for its success in engaging young people. Its a great example of how serious 
public safety information can be communicated in an entertaining (and low cost production) format. 

(cid:346)(cid:410)(cid:410)(cid:393)(cid:400)(cid:855)(cid:876)(cid:876)(cid:449)(cid:449)(cid:449)(cid:856)(cid:410)(cid:349)(cid:364)(cid:410)(cid:381)(cid:364)(cid:856)(cid:272)(cid:381)(cid:373)(cid:876)(cid:923)(cid:336)(cid:381)(cid:448)(cid:856)(cid:400)(cid:336)(cid:845)(cid:367)(cid:258)(cid:374)(cid:336)(cid:1089)(cid:286)(cid:374) ((cid:923)(cid:336)(cid:381)(cid:448)(cid:856)(cid:400)(cid:336))

Lastly, I&#39;ll just clarify that the fact-checking partnership with the AFP is ongoing and informs our day-to-day 
moderation processes. It is part of our broader Trust and Safety efforts (which includes engagement with official 
bodies such as the AEC) to combat misinformation on TikTok.

I will follow up with you shortly regarding next steps for a PSA!

Good morning Julie, Anastasia, and Taskforce members

Thank you again for taking the time to participate in yesterday&#39;s Transparency and Accountability Centre tour. I 
hope the tour provided some useful information about TikTok&#39;s recommendation system, content moderation 
and data security approach. 

Just following up on a couple of things that were raised.

1.    TikTok Australia entered into a partnership with Agence France-Presse (AFP) in 2020 to incorporate its 
expertise on fact-checking and combating misinformation. The article below provides some further detail on the 
AFP&#39;s reputation and how we are working together: 

(cid:346)(cid:410)(cid:410)(cid:393)(cid:400)(cid:855)(cid:876)(cid:876)(cid:449)(cid:449)(cid:449)(cid:856)(cid:258)(cid:296)(cid:393)(cid:856)(cid:272)(cid:381)(cid:373)(cid:876)(cid:286)(cid:374)(cid:876)(cid:258)(cid:336)(cid:286)(cid:374)(cid:272)(cid:455)(cid:876)(cid:393)(cid:396)(cid:286)(cid:400)(cid:400)(cid:882)(cid:396)(cid:286)(cid:367)(cid:286)(cid:258)(cid:400)(cid:286)(cid:400)(cid:882)(cid:374)(cid:286)(cid:449)(cid:400)(cid:367)(cid:286)(cid:410)(cid:410)(cid:286)(cid:396)(cid:876)(cid:258)(cid:296)(cid:393)(cid:882)(cid:286)(cid:374)(cid:410)(cid:286)(cid:396)(cid:400)(cid:882)(cid:393)(cid:258)(cid:396)(cid:410)(cid:374)(cid:286)(cid:396)(cid:400)(cid:346)(cid:349)(cid:393)(cid:882)(cid:410)(cid:349)(cid:364)(cid:410)(cid:381)(cid:364)(cid:882)(cid:296)(cid:258)(cid:272)(cid:410)(cid:882)(cid:272)(cid:346)(cid:286)(cid:272)(cid:364)(cid:349)(cid:374)(cid:336)(cid:882)(cid:258)(cid:400)(cid:349)(cid:258)(cid:882)(cid:393)(cid:258)(cid:272)(cid:349)(cid:296)(cid:349)(cid:272)

1.    On-platform PSA and verified AEC account 

One thing that I forgot to mention is that we can offer the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) an on-platform 
Public Service Announcement (PSA) that will be seen by TikTok users when they search election related 
hashtags. The screenshot below provides a rough idea of how such a PSA could look.

If desired, we are also able to help AEC activate and verify an official TikTok account. This would provide the 
AEC a presence on our platform and direct reach to our large and growing numbers of users. Below I have 
attached an example of content we worked in collaboration with the Australian eSafety Commission (and local 
TikTok creators) to produce for their verified account on TikTok. 

Please let me know if you have any further questions or would like to follow-up on the above!

Kind regards

Hi Anastasia,

There is a weird limitation we have with our 
Teams accounts where we cant seem to directly 
invite people outside of TikTok to meetings (which 
is why I did not send an invite in my prior email). 

I am asking my IT team to have a look at this 
today but in the eventuallity that I cant fix it, are 
you able to send the link to the attendees 
(perhaps attach the copied Teams link in a 
discrete calendar invite)?

Apologies for the inconvenience.

Kind regards

Hi Anastasia,

Yes I will do - I am just awaiting 
for a Microsoft Teams link from 
my colleagues.

Typically we run it via Zoom so I 
dont have the right Teams 
corporate account to do it myself!

Have a nice weekend.

Hi Jeff,

Thank you for making the time to discuss earlier today.

I’ve added in my colleagues who are best placed to discuss this further – they are based in the Sydney/Singapore
time zones and can advise on the processes with respect to FB Inc.

I’ll have to check whether a call before midday Thursday is possible but can certainly aim for a time before the end

Hi 

,

Thank you for coming back to us with this and for your detailed response.

We would very much appreciate meeting with you next week to discuss the scenarios further. If still
available, Thursday 28 October from 9:30am suits us and the relevant EIAT subset best.

Would you like me to circulate a Teams invite?

Hi Anastasia

Not a problem, I know it can be tough to coordinate a number of diaries!

19 July at 12pm works for us, we can talk through the functionality of the tool and then have time for
Q&amp;A at the end of the session.

Would you like to send the invite with your Microsoft Teams link? From our side it will be 

, myself, 

 and 

 (CC’d).

Many thanks

Hi 

Thanks for reaching out. Prior to scheduling a meeting to set up our portal account, can we please
have a separate chat about the portal’s functionality?

We have three different teams with interest in utilising the portal and to determine how we can best
accommodate this, it would be great to get some more information. E.g. can the AEC have more than
one mailbox with portal access? Hopeful to discuss further.

Kind regards,

Hi Anastasia

Great to be in touch. We’d be very happy to organise a call with you and team to talk through the 

 the process and timeline for getting set up.

I’ve noted some times below that will work for us, are you able to let me know which time suits you
and the team? I think 45 minutes to run through the tool and ask questions with suffice.

Fri 16 July – 12.00-12.45, 14.00-14.45
Mon 19 July – between 12 and 1400
Thurs 22 July – between 1400 and 1600

Many thanks

That’s terrific, thanks very much Anastasia. We’d be very happy to line up a time to talk through the
new channel with a member of the team who administers it.
I’ve copied in
all to discuss how to progress with this. She’s also been helping another regulator get onto the new
channel recently, so she’s the local expert in how it works.

, who I think you met the other day, who can help coordinate and find a time for us

 will be in touch shortly.

Cheers

Hi 
Thank you so much for the below, the attached and today’s additional mis/disinformation session, we
appreciate your ongoing engagement with us!
We are very keen to initiate the process to gain trusted access to your new portal, so would like to
either set up another meeting or discuss how we can otherwise progress this. We are particularly
interested in more information about the specific requirements for processing each request (which I
note is dependent on the selected reason). Depending on the timeline for setting up access to the
portal, and in being conscious that we would like to incorporate the details into the preparation
activities we are currently conducting, is it possible that we can get further information on this at your
earliest convenience?
Thank you again for your ongoing assistance

Do not click links or open attachments unless you recognise the sender and know the content is safe.\n\nGood morning Julie,\n\nFully appreciate the need for the AEC/EIAT to consider its options carefully!\n\nWe are glad to hear the AEC is interested in working with TikTok on an Election PSA. Our processes have slightly changed since the last time we did one with the NZ Government, so I will double-check the exact steps before sending them through to you. It is a fairly straightforward process which involves identifying relevant at-risk content (via #hashtags) and providing\ninformation that can be placed on platform to direct people to official / reputable sources when they encounter the identified content. \n\nI also note your point regarding the AEC's limited capacity to run a verified account on TikTok this election period. If the AEC continues to be interested in this option in the future, we can certainly revisit that then and outline the support we can provide. Below I have copied the Singaporean Government's TikTok account which has been positively reported on for its\nsuccess in engaging young people. Its a great example of how serious public safety information can be communicated in an entertaining (and low cost production) format. \n\nhttps://www.tiktok.com/@gov.sg?lang=en (@gov.sg)\n\nLastly, I'll just clarify that the fact-checking partnership with the AFP is ongoing and informs our day-to-day moderation processes. It is part of our broader Trust and Safety efforts (which includes engagement with official bodies such as the AEC) to combat misinformation on TikTok.\n\nI will follow up with you shortly regarding next steps for a PSA!\n\nKind regards\n\nOn Mon, Jul 12, 2021, 5:11 PM <Julie.Igglesden@aec.gov.au> wrote:\n\nHi\n\nComing back to you on the below email after some time to consume and consider.\n\nWhile the fact checking partnership seems like a fabulous initiative in those circumstances, we won\u2019t be able to invest into something similar. As per our initial discussions though we are incredibly appreciative of the cohesive working arrangements we\u2019ll share moving forward for any content referrals. The AEC also acknowledges the effort\nTik Tok is investing into their platform to identify and address disinformation, particularly around Australian federal electoral processes.\n\nWe would like to take up the offer of an AEC PSA during the election period. Very keen to understand this further \u2013 i.e. - how, when, formats/constraints for content we\u2019d need to provide etc. Really appreciative of this offer as it will be valuable to reach the Australian Tik Tok audience with an AEC message of this sort, at the appropriate time.\n\nWe\u2019ve carefully considered the idea of creating an AEC Tik Tok account but decided against it at this stage. Our thought process is that if we are to go down this path we need to properly invest the time and effort into appropriate content for the channel and we\u2019re not positioned to do that at this time. Perhaps the federal election after this\none.\n\nKind Regards\nJulie\n\nJulie Igglesden | Electoral Interference Coordinator\nDigital Technology & Communications Branch\nAustralian Electoral Commission\nM: \nT: (02) 6271 4687 X:\n\nAustralian Electoral Commission logo\n\n@tiktok.com> \n\nFrom: \nSent: Friday, 18 June 2021 9:57 AM\nTo: Julie Igglesden <Julie.Igglesden@aec.gov.au>\nCc: Anastasia Batten <Anastasia.Batten@aec.gov.au>; EIAT <EIAT@aec.gov.au>\nSubject: TikTok follow-up on AFP partnership and AEC PSA and verified account\n\nCAUTION: This email originated from outside of the Australian Federal Government.

I hope the tour provided some useful information about TikTok's recommendation system, content moderation and data security approach. \n\nJust following up on a couple of things that were raised.\n\n1.    TikTok Australia entered into a partnership with Agence France-Presse (AFP) in 2020 to incorporate its expertise on fact-checking and combating misinformation. The article below provides some further detail on the AFP's reputation and how we are working together: \nhttps://www.afp.com/en/agency/press-releases-newsletter/afp-enters-partnership-tiktok-fact-checking-asia-pacific\n\n1.    On-platform PSA and verified AEC account \n\nOne thing that I forgot to mention is that we can offer the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) an on-platform Public Service Announcement (PSA) that will be seen by TikTok users when they search election related hashtags. The screenshot below provides a rough idea of how such a PSA could look.\n\nAustralian Electoral Commission\n\nIf desired, we are also able to help AEC activate and verify an official TikTok account. This would provide the AEC a presence on our platform and direct reach to our large and growing numbers of users. Below I have attached an example of content we worked in collaboration with the Australian eSafety Commission (and local TikTok creators) to produce for their\nverified account on TikTok. \n\nPlease let me know if you have any further questions or would like to follow-up on the above!\n\nKind regards\n\nOn Tue, Jun 15, 2021, 4:06 PM <\n\n@tiktok.com> wrote:\n\nThankyou!\n\nOn Tue, Jun 15, 2021, 1:59 PM <Anastasia.Batten@aec.gov.au> wrote:\n\nHi Nathan,\n\nYes of course, happy to do that in any instance so your IT team doesn\u2019t have to move mountains!\n\nI\u2019ll circulate it on our end now, thanks again.\n\nKind regards,\n\nAnastasia Batten | A/g Operations Manager\nVIC State Office | VIC State Office and Outposts\nAustralian Electoral Commission\nT: (03) 9285 7139 X: \n\nReleased by Australian Electoral Commission under the Freedom of Information Act 1982s 22s 22s 22s 22s 22s 22s 22s 22s 22s 22s 22\n\n\n--- Page 3 ---\n\nAustralian Electoral Commission logo\n\nAustralian Electoral Commission\n\n@tiktok.com> \n\nFrom:\nSent: Tuesday, 15 June 2021 1:50 PM\nTo: Anastasia Batten <Anastasia.Batten@aec.gov.au>\nCc: Julie Igglesden <Julie.Igglesden@aec.gov.au>\nSubject: Re: RE: [External] TikTok follow-up + government reporting channel [SEC=OFFICIAL:Sensitive]\n\nCAUTION: This email originated from outside of the Australian Federal Government.

However I do propose we organise the Transparency and Accountability Centre Tour first (for the AEC\nand Taskforce members together), as it is comprehensive and (from what I have seen) informative for regulators/government stakeholders. \n\nThe tour also includes speakers that we would likely ask to sit-in on meetings to discuss issues that may be of interest to particular agencies so it is an efficent way for us to address any\nquestions from the various departments on the EIAT. \n\nFrom that point onnwards, we can work out what other meetings are needed and I can arrange everyone on my end. \n\nLet me know if that approach sounds appropriate to you. We are a small team so where we can answers questions upfront or consolidate meetings helps us a lot!\n\nKind regards\n\nOn Tue, May 18, 2021, 1:21 PM <Julie.Igglesden@aec.gov.au> wrote:\n\nAfternoon\n\nOur pleasure, thank you also for taking the time to meet with us in person.\n\nWe will note the preferred reporting pathways below and follow that pattern as we go forward.

Content on our platform is tagged by #hashtags, so this means that whenever users search for these \nrelevant hashtags in the Discover Page on TikTok, the PSA will appear at the top of the screen. \n\n[Example of the PSA]\n\n(cid:24)\n\nReleased by Australian Electoral Commission under the Freedom of Information Act 1982s 22s 22s 22\n\n\n--- Page 6 ---\n\nI worked extensively with our Trust and Safety team to include all the possible hashtags that could be relevant, \nbut both the PSA wording and hashtag list can be changed in the leadup to the election, to reflect the content on \nplatform. \n\nPlease mark any changes to the wording/list in the document attached and we will include them in a final copy \nof the PSA proposal to send through. Note there is some highlighted text for the AEC to fill in e.g. if you want the \nPSA to identify links to the AEC homepage or a specific 2022 page.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions.\n\nKind regards,\n\n(cid:75)(cid:374) (cid:100)(cid:437)(cid:286)(cid:853) (cid:58)(cid:437)(cid:367) (cid:1005)(cid:1007)(cid:853) (cid:1006)(cid:1004)(cid:1006)(cid:1005)(cid:853) (cid:1009)(cid:855)(cid:1007)(cid:1011) (cid:87)(cid:68) (cid:1092)(cid:58)(cid:437)(cid:367)(cid:349)(cid:286)(cid:856)(cid:47)(cid:336)(cid:336)(cid:367)(cid:286)(cid:400)(cid:282)(cid:286)(cid:374)(cid:923)(cid:258)(cid:286)(cid:272)(cid:856)(cid:336)(cid:381)(cid:448)(cid:856)(cid:258)(cid:437)(cid:1093) (cid:449)(cid:396)(cid:381)(cid:410)(cid:286)(cid:855)\n\n(cid:100)(cid:346)(cid:258)(cid:374)(cid:364)(cid:400)\n\n(cid:853) (cid:367)(cid:381)(cid:381)(cid:364) (cid:296)(cid:381)(cid:396)(cid:449)(cid:258)(cid:396)(cid:282) (cid:410)(cid:381) (cid:272)(cid:381)(cid:374)(cid:410)(cid:349)(cid:374)(cid:437)(cid:349)(cid:374)(cid:336) (cid:410)(cid:346)(cid:286) (cid:272)(cid:381)(cid:374)(cid:448)(cid:286)(cid:396)(cid:400)(cid:258)(cid:410)(cid:349)(cid:381)(cid:374)(cid:856)\n\n(cid:58)(cid:437)(cid:367)(cid:349)(cid:286)\n\nJulie Igglesden | Electoral Interference Coordinator \n\nDigital Technology & Communications Branch\n\nAustralian Electoral Commission\n\nT: (02) 6271 4687 X: \n\n M: \n\n(cid:25)\n\nReleased by Australian Electoral Commission under the Freedom of Information Act 1982s 22s 22s 22s 22\n\n\n--- Page 7 ---\n\n(cid:923)(cid:410)(cid:349)(cid:364)(cid:410)(cid:381)(cid:364)(cid:856)(cid:272)(cid:381)(cid:373)(cid:1093)\n\n(cid:38)(cid:396)(cid:381)(cid:373)(cid:855)\n(cid:94)(cid:286)(cid:374)(cid:410)(cid:855) (cid:100)(cid:437)(cid:286)(cid:400)(cid:282)(cid:258)(cid:455)(cid:853) (cid:1005)(cid:1007) (cid:58)(cid:437)(cid:367)(cid:455) (cid:1006)(cid:1004)(cid:1006)(cid:1005) (cid:1013)(cid:855)(cid:1008)(cid:1011) (cid:4)(cid:68)\n(cid:100)(cid:381)(cid:855) (cid:58)(cid:437)(cid:367)(cid:349)(cid:286) (cid:47)(cid:336)(cid:336)(cid:367)(cid:286)(cid:400)(cid:282)(cid:286)(cid:374) (cid:1092)(cid:58)(cid:437)(cid:367)(cid:349)(cid:286)(cid:856)(cid:47)(cid:336)(cid:336)(cid:367)(cid:286)(cid:400)(cid:282)(cid:286)(cid:374)(cid:923)(cid:258)(cid:286)(cid:272)(cid:856)(cid:336)(cid:381)(cid:448)(cid:856)(cid:258)(cid:437)(cid:1093)\n(cid:18)(cid:272)(cid:855) (cid:4)(cid:374)(cid:258)(cid:400)(cid:410)(cid:258)(cid:400)(cid:349)(cid:258) (cid:17)(cid:258)(cid:410)(cid:410)(cid:286)(cid:374) (cid:1092)(cid:4)(cid:374)(cid:258)(cid:400)(cid:410)(cid:258)(cid:400)(cid:349)(cid:258)(cid:856)(cid:17)(cid:258)(cid:410)(cid:410)(cid:286)(cid:374)(cid:923)(cid:258)(cid:286)(cid:272)(cid:856)(cid:336)(cid:381)(cid:448)(cid:856)(cid:258)(cid:437)(cid:1093)(cid:854) (cid:28)(cid:47)(cid:4)(cid:100) (cid:1092)(cid:28)(cid:47)(cid:4)(cid:100)(cid:923)(cid:258)(cid:286)(cid:272)(cid:856)(cid:336)(cid:381)(cid:448)(cid:856)(cid:258)(cid:437)(cid:1093)\n(cid:94)(cid:437)(cid:271)(cid:361)(cid:286)(cid:272)(cid:410)(cid:855) (cid:100)(cid:349)(cid:364)(cid:100)(cid:381)(cid:364) (cid:296)(cid:381)(cid:367)(cid:367)(cid:381)(cid:449)(cid:882)(cid:437)(cid:393) (cid:381)(cid:374) (cid:4)(cid:28)(cid:18) (cid:87)(cid:94)(cid:4)\n\n(cid:18)(cid:4)(cid:104)(cid:100)(cid:47)(cid:75)(cid:69)(cid:855) (cid:100)(cid:346)(cid:349)(cid:400) (cid:286)(cid:373)(cid:258)(cid:349)(cid:367) (cid:381)(cid:396)(cid:349)(cid:336)(cid:349)(cid:374)(cid:258)(cid:410)(cid:286)(cid:282) (cid:296)(cid:396)(cid:381)(cid:373) (cid:381)(cid:437)(cid:410)(cid:400)(cid:349)(cid:282)(cid:286) (cid:381)(cid:296) (cid:410)(cid:346)(cid:286) (cid:4)(cid:437)(cid:400)(cid:410)(cid:396)(cid:258)(cid:367)(cid:349)(cid:258)(cid:374) (cid:38)(cid:286)(cid:282)(cid:286)(cid:396)(cid:258)(cid:367) (cid:39)(cid:381)(cid:448)(cid:286)(cid:396)(cid:374)(cid:373)(cid:286)(cid:374)(cid:410)(cid:856) (cid:24)(cid:381) (cid:374)(cid:381)(cid:410) (cid:272)(cid:367)(cid:349)(cid:272)(cid:364) (cid:367)(cid:349)(cid:374)(cid:364)(cid:400) (cid:381)(cid:396) (cid:381)(cid:393)(cid:286)(cid:374)\n(cid:258)(cid:410)(cid:410)(cid:258)(cid:272)(cid:346)(cid:373)(cid:286)(cid:374)(cid:410)(cid:400) (cid:437)(cid:374)(cid:367)(cid:286)(cid:400)(cid:400) (cid:455)(cid:381)(cid:437) (cid:396)(cid:286)(cid:272)(cid:381)(cid:336)(cid:374)(cid:349)(cid:400)(cid:286) (cid:410)(cid:346)(cid:286) (cid:400)(cid:286)(cid:374)(cid:282)(cid:286)(cid:396) (cid:258)(cid:374)(cid:282) (cid:364)(cid:374)(cid:381)(cid:449) (cid:410)(cid:346)(cid:286) (cid:272)(cid:381)(cid:374)(cid:410)(cid:286)(cid:374)(cid:410) (cid:349)(cid:400) (cid:400)(cid:258)(cid:296)(cid:286)(cid:856)\n\nGood morning Julie,\n\nFully appreciate the need for the AEC/EIAT to consider its options carefully!\n\nWe are glad to hear the AEC is interested in working with TikTok on an Election PSA. Our processes have \nslightly changed since the last time we did one with the NZ Government, so I will double-check the exact steps \nbefore sending them through to you. It is a fairly straightforward process which involves identifying relevant at-\nrisk content (via #hashtags) and providing information that can be placed on platform to direct people to official / \nreputable sources when they encounter the identified content. \n\nI also note your point regarding the AEC's limited capacity to run a verified account on TikTok this election \nperiod. If the AEC continues to be interested in this option in the future, we can certainly revisit that then and \noutline the support we can provide. Below I have copied the Singaporean Government's TikTok account which \nhas been positively reported on for its success in engaging young people. Its a great example of how serious \npublic safety information can be communicated in an entertaining (and low cost production) format. \n\n(cid:346)(cid:410)(cid:410)(cid:393)(cid:400)(cid:855)(cid:876)(cid:876)(cid:449)(cid:449)(cid:449)(cid:856)(cid:410)(cid:349)(cid:364)(cid:410)(cid:381)(cid:364)(cid:856)(cid:272)(cid:381)(cid:373)(cid:876)(cid:923)(cid:336)(cid:381)(cid:448)(cid:856)(cid:400)(cid:336)(cid:845)(cid:367)(cid:258)(cid:374)(cid:336)(cid:1089)(cid:286)(cid:374) ((cid:923)(cid:336)(cid:381)(cid:448)(cid:856)(cid:400)(cid:336))\n\nLastly, I'll just clarify that the fact-checking partnership with the AFP is ongoing and informs our day-to-day \nmoderation processes. It is part of our broader Trust and Safety efforts (which includes engagement with official \nbodies such as the AEC) to combat misinformation on TikTok.\n\nI will follow up with you shortly regarding next steps for a PSA!\n\nKind regards\n\n(cid:75)(cid:374) (cid:68)(cid:381)(cid:374)(cid:853) (cid:58)(cid:437)(cid:367) (cid:1005)(cid:1006)(cid:853)

Accountability Centre tour. I \nhope the tour provided some useful information about TikTok's recommendation system, content moderation \nand data security approach. \n\nJust following up on a couple of things that were raised.\n\n1.    TikTok Australia entered into a partnership with Agence France-Presse (AFP) in 2020 to incorporate its \nexpertise on fact-checking and combating misinformation. The article below provides some further detail on the \nAFP's reputation and how we are working together: \n\n(cid:346)(cid:410)(cid:410)(cid:393)(cid:400)(cid:855)(cid:876)(cid:876)(cid:449)(cid:449)(cid:449)(cid:856)(cid:258)(cid:296)(cid:393)(cid:856)(cid:272)(cid:381)(cid:373)(cid:876)(cid:286)(cid:374)(cid:876)(cid:258)(cid:336)(cid:286)(cid:374)(cid:272)(cid:455)(cid:876)(cid:393)(cid:396)(cid:286)(cid:400)(cid:400)(cid:882)(cid:396)(cid:286)(cid:367)(cid:286)(cid:258)(cid:400)(cid:286)(cid:400)(cid:882)(cid:374)(cid:286)(cid:449)(cid:400)(cid:367)(cid:286)(cid:410)(cid:410)(cid:286)(cid:396)(cid:876)(cid:258)(cid:296)(cid:393)(cid:882)(cid:286)(cid:374)(cid:410)(cid:286)(cid:396)(cid:400)(cid:882)(cid:393)(cid:258)(cid:396)(cid:410)(cid:374)(cid:286)(cid:396)(cid:400)(cid:346)(cid:349)(cid:393)(cid:882)(cid:410)(cid:349)(cid:364)(cid:410)(cid:381)(cid:364)(cid:882)(cid:296)(cid:258)(cid:272)(cid:410)(cid:882)(cid:272)(cid:346)(cid:286)(cid:272)(cid:364)(cid:349)(cid:374)(cid:336)(cid:882)(cid:258)(cid:400)(cid:349)(cid:258)(cid:882)(cid:393)(cid:258)(cid:272)(cid:349)(cid:296)(cid:349)(cid:272)\n\n1.    On-platform PSA and verified AEC account \n\nOne thing that I forgot to mention is that we can offer the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) an on-platform \nPublic Service Announcement (PSA) that will be seen by TikTok users when they search election related \nhashtags. The screenshot below provides a rough idea of how such a PSA could look.\n\n(cid:28)\n\nReleased by Australian Electoral Commission under the Freedom of Information Act 1982\n\n\n--- Page 10 ---\n\n(cid:20)(cid:19)\n\nReleased by Australian Electoral Commission under the Freedom of Information Act 1982\n\n\n--- Page 11 ---\n\nIf desired, we are also able to help AEC activate and verify an official TikTok account. This would provide the \nAEC a presence on our platform and direct reach to our large and growing numbers of users. Below I have \nattached an example of content we worked in collaboration with the Australian eSafety Commission (and local \nTikTok creators) to produce for their verified account on TikTok. \n\nPlease let me know if you have any further questions or would like to follow-up on the above!\n\nKind regards\n\nOn Tue, Jun 15, 2021, 4:06 PM <\nwrote:\n\n(cid:923)(cid:410)(cid:349)(cid:364)(cid:410)(cid:381)(cid:364)(cid:856)(cid:272)(cid:381)(cid:373)> \n\nThankyou!\n\nOn Tue, Jun 15, 2021, 1:59 PM \n<(cid:4)(cid:374)(cid:258)(cid:400)(cid:410)(cid:258)(cid:400)(cid:349)(cid:258)(cid:856)(cid:17)(cid:258)(cid:410)(cid:410)(cid:286)(cid:374)(cid:923)(cid:258)(cid:286)(cid:272)(cid:856)(cid:336)(cid:381)(cid:448)(cid:856)(cid:258)(cid:437)> wrote:\n\nHi \n\n,\n\nYes of course, happy to do that in any instance so \nyour IT team doesn\u2019t have to move mountains!\n\nI\u2019ll circulate it on our end now, thanks again.\n\nKind regards,\n\nAnastasia Batten | A/g Operations Manager \n\nVIC State Office | VIC State Office and Outposts\n\nAustralian Electoral Commission\n\nT: (03) 9285 7139 X: \n\n(cid:20)(cid:20)\n\nReleased by Australian Electoral Commission under the Freedom of Information Act 1982s 22s 22s 22s 22\n\n\n--- Page 12 ---\n\n(cid:923)(cid:410)(cid:349)(cid:364)(cid:410)(cid:381)(cid:364)(cid:856)(cid:272)(cid:381)(cid:373)>  \n\nFrom: \nSent: Tuesday, 15 June 2021 1:50 PM \nTo: Anastasia Batten \n<(cid:4)(cid:374)(cid:258)(cid:400)(cid:410)(cid:258)(cid:400)(cid:349)(cid:258)(cid:856)(cid:17)(cid:258)(cid:410)(cid:410)(cid:286)(cid:374)(cid:923)(cid:258)(cid:286)(cid:272)(cid:856)(cid:336)(cid:381)(cid:448)(cid:856)(cid:258)(cid:437)> \nCc: Julie Igglesden <(cid:58)(cid:437)(cid:367)(cid:349)(cid:286)(cid:856)(cid:47)(cid:336)(cid:336)(cid:367)(cid:286)(cid:400)(cid:282)(cid:286)(cid:374)(cid:923)(cid:258)(cid:286)(cid:272)(cid:856)(cid:336)(cid:381)(cid:448)(cid:856)(cid:258)(cid:437)> \nSubject: Re: RE: [External] TikTok follow-up + \ngovernment reporting channel \n[SEC=OFFICIAL:Sensitive]\n\nCAUTION: This email originated from outside of \nthe Australian Federal Government.

The primary focus of this correspondence is electoral compliance, combating misinformation, and ensuring \"electoral integrity.\"\n\n**Social Justice:**\nThe AEC's stated aim to combat \"electoral interference,\" \"misinformation,\" and \"disinformation\" aligns with progressive values by seeking to ensure an informed electorate and preserve the integrity of democratic processes. The use of Public Service Announcements (PSAs) on platforms like TikTok and efforts to direct users to \"official / reputable sources\" (TikTok email, Page 7) could be viewed as positive steps toward civic education and equitable information access, particularly for younger demographics who rely heavily on these platforms. However, a progressive analysis must also consider the potential for such efforts, when outsourced to private corporations, to inadvertently or disproportionately impact marginalized voices or legitimate grassroots movements that may struggle to be categorized as \"official\" or \"reputable.\" The AEC's admitted \"limited capacity to run a verified account on TikTok\" (TikTok email, Page 7) underscores a dependency that could limit genuine, independent public outreach.\n\n**Environmental Impact:**\nThese documents do not contain information related to environmental impact.\n\n**Wealth Distribution:**\nThese documents do not contain information related to wealth distribution.\n\n**Corporate Influence:**\nThe documents starkly highlight the pervasive and concerning influence of powerful, privately owned tech corporations on core democratic functions. The routine \"correspondence,\" \"meetings,\" \"Transparency and Accountability Centre tours\" (TikTok emails, Pages 3-4), and \"selected briefing sessions on misinformation / disinformation\" (Facebook email, Page 3 of Schedule) illustrate a deep entanglement. The AEC is actively engaged in developing \"electoral communications escalation scenarios\" (Documents 10, 37, 47, 49, 50) with these platforms, formalizing a process where corporate entities are relied upon to identify and potentially act upon \"concerning content\" (TikTok email, Page 5). This collaboration, while framed as necessary, effectively delegates significant power over public discourse and information flow to profit-driven corporations, whose primary accountability is to shareholders, not citizens. The willingness of these tech giants to offer services like on-platform PSAs and fact-checking partnerships (TikTok email, Page 7-9) demonstrates their readiness to entrench their role as arbiters of information, further embedding their corporate influence within the democratic infrastructure. This reliance on a handful of powerful, unregulated corporations for the health of a nation's electoral process represents a significant deviation from progressive values of public control and democratic accountability.\n\n**Civil Liberties:**\nThe collaborative efforts to identify and address \"misinformation\" and \"disinformation\" raise substantial civil liberties concerns from a left-leaning perspective, particularly regarding freedom of speech and the potential for censorship. While protecting electoral integrity is vital, the means employed \u2013 relying on private companies for content moderation at the government's behest \u2013 bypass traditional democratic safeguards. The \"escalation scenarios\" (Documents 10, 37, 47, 49, 50) and the AEC's desire for \"trusted access to your new portal\" (Facebook email, Page 9) imply a streamlined process for flagging and potentially removing content. This delegation of power to private entities means that decisions about what constitutes \"misinformation\" are made outside transparent public scrutiny, without judicial oversight, and potentially without robust appeal mechanisms. This carries the inherent risk of politically motivated censorship or algorithmic bias impacting legitimate dissent, critical viewpoints, or alternative media, which may be incorrectly flagged by a system prioritizing \"official\" narratives. The consistent \"CAUTION: This email originated from outside of the Australian Federal Government\" banner in the correspondence (e.g., TikTok email, Page 1) serves as a stark reminder that the AEC is relying on external, unaccountable corporate actors to manage fundamental aspects of civil discourse during an election, posing a direct threat to civil liberties and the democratic principle of public control over information.", "model": "gemini-2.5-flash", "generated_at": "2025-06-22T14:25:08.371114", "source_hash": "b8d04fe24e7c75d95d0bcc9d260599703234c40653440c079b880688be33332c", "raw_response_path": "data/llm_responses/LEX1697__overall__left_leaning__20250622T142508.json", "output_tokens": 856, "prompt_tokens": 74193, "total_tokens": 76595, "summary_length": 4658}, "short_index": {"text": "The FOI documents reveal a deeply concerning reliance by the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) on major tech corporations like TikTok, Google, Twitter, and Meta to manage \"electoral integrity\" and combat \"misinformation\" during the 2022 Federal election.

This outsourcing of core democratic functions to corporate actors risks marginalizing legitimate grassroots movements and dissenting voices by prioritizing \"official\" narratives, while bypassing crucial civil liberty safeguards like transparent public scrutiny and judicial oversight.

By developing and sharing \"escalation scenarios\" and discussing \"trusted access portals\" for reporting \"concerning content,\" the government is creating a formalized mechanism to influence what speech is permitted or amplified online. This blurs the lines between legitimate electoral regulation and de facto censorship, potentially stifling dissenting or critical political opinions under the broad guise of \"misinformation.\"\n*   **Bias Towards \"Official Sources\":** TikTok's offer of Public Service Announcements (PSAs) to direct users to \"official / reputable sources\" when searching election-related hashtags, embraced by the AEC, suggests an inherent preference for government-approved narratives over independent discourse. This can undermine trust in non-establishment media and limit citizens' access to a wide range of viewpoints essential for informed decision-making.\n\n**Limited Government: Expanding Bureaucratic Overreach**\nThe nature and scope of the AEC's engagement with these platforms signify a notable expansion of government's role beyond its traditional, limited function of administering free and fair elections.\n*   **Beyond Electoral Administration:** Historically, an electoral commission's role is to manage the mechanics of voting, registration, and campaign finance. These documents reveal the AEC is now deeply involved in policing online speech, a domain that, from a limited government perspective, should remain largely unregulated by the state to protect individual expression.\n*   **Partnerships with Private Power:** The creation of formal \"liaison\" relationships and reporting \"channels\" with powerful tech monopolies effectively deputizes these private companies into an adjunct of state information control. This fusion of government and corporate power to manage public discourse is deeply concerning for those who advocate for a smaller, less intrusive government.\n\n**National Security: Unaddressed Risks vs. Operational Control**\nWhile ensuring electoral integrity against foreign interference is a valid national security concern, the documents indicate a focus on operational content control rather than a deep assessment of inherent risks.\n*   **TikTok's Foreign Ownership:** The extensive engagement with TikTok, a platform owned by ByteDance (a Chinese company), highlights a potential national security blind spot. While TikTok offered a \"Transparency and Accountability Centre tour\" to the AEC, the documents do not provide evidence of a rigorous, independent assessment by the AEC or other Australian security agencies regarding the data security implications or potential foreign influence via this platform's ownership. The focus appears to be on functional cooperation for content moderation rather than a comprehensive risk analysis of the platform itself.\n\n**Economic Efficiency & Fiscal Responsibility: Bureaucracy Over Outputs**\nThe documents do not detail significant direct financial expenditures beyond staff time, which points to a different kind of efficiency concern.\n*   **Bureaucratic Focus:** The numerous emails discussing meeting schedules, drafting \"escalation scenarios,\" and setting up \"trusted access portals\" demonstrate considerable bureaucratic effort. While staff time is a cost, the concern for fiscal conservatives lies less in a direct monetary outlay and more in the diversion of government resources towards activities (speech policing) that are outside its core function and potentially counterproductive to a free society.\n*   **AEC's Capacity Constraints:** The AEC's decision not to establish its own verified TikTok account due to \"limited capacity to run a verified account\" and the need to \"properly invest the time and effort\" suggests a pragmatic, albeit minor, avoidance of a potentially unproductive investment. However, this small saving is overshadowed by the significant resources dedicated to managing and influencing content on external platforms.\n\nIn summary, the FOI documents reveal a concerning trend of government overreach, where the AEC actively collaborates with private tech giants to manage online political discourse. This deviation from limited government principles and its chilling effect on individual liberty and free speech represent a significant concern for politically right-leaning analysts, despite any stated goals of \"electoral integrity\" or \"combating misinformation.\" The operational focus on content control also raises questions about whether deeper national security implications, particularly with platforms like TikTok, are being adequately addressed beyond superficial \"transparency tours.\"", "model": "gemini-2.5-flash", "generated_at": "2025-06-22T14:25:38.613546", "source_hash": "b8d04fe24e7c75d95d0bcc9d260599703234c40653440c079b880688be33332c", "raw_response_path": "data/llm_responses/LEX1697__overall__right_leaning__20250622T142538.json", "output_tokens": 1012, "prompt_tokens": 74193, "total_tokens": 77676, "summary_length": 5750}, "short_index": {"text": "The released FOI documents reveal the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) extensively collaborated with major social media platforms like TikTok and Meta to manage \"misinformation\" and \"disinformation\" before the 2022 Federal election.

While ostensibly aimed at \"electoral integrity\" and combating \"misinformation/disinformation,\" a critical review reveals several concerning aspects:\n\n1.  **Orchestrated Information Control and Potential Overreach:** The AEC is actively developing and sharing \"electoral communications escalation scenarios\" with these private platforms. These are not mere guidelines; they are blueprints for identifying and addressing \"concerning content\" or \"misinformation,\" effectively deputizing tech companies to enforce a government-approved narrative. The establishment of direct \"government reporting channels\" allows the AEC to flag content for review and potential removal, granting an alarming level of influence over public discourse without direct democratic oversight. This proactive shaping of the information environment prior to an election raises serious questions about freedom of expression and the potential for political bias in content moderation.\n\n2.  **Lack of Transparency and Accountability:** A significant number of communications are marked \"SEC=OFFICIAL:Sensitive,\" despite pertaining to the fundamental democratic process of an election and interactions with public-facing platforms. The specific details of these \"escalation scenarios\" remain withheld, preventing public scrutiny of the criteria for content flagging or removal. The very need for an FOI request, following an internal review (LEX1697 of LEX1147), suggests an initial reluctance by the AEC to openly share information about these collaborations, fostering an environment of opacity.\n\n3.  **Questionable Resource Allocation and Inefficiency:** While the AEC claims \"limited capacity\" to run its own verified TikTok account and properly engage with the platform directly, citing the need to \"properly invest the time and effort,\" it is simultaneously dedicating \"three different teams with interest in utilising the portal\" for content referrals to private companies. This suggests a dubious prioritization of resources towards external content policing rather than robust internal public communication strategies. Minor bureaucratic inefficiencies are also evident, with delays in simply setting up virtual meetings due to \"weird limitations\" or lacking \"the right Teams corporate account,\" highlighting a lack of seamless integration despite the declared importance of these partnerships.\n\n4.  **Blurring Lines and Delegated Authority:** The reliance on social media platforms and their internal \"Trust and Safety teams\" (e.g., TikTok's partnership with Agence France-Presse for fact-checking) outsources a critical aspect of electoral integrity\u2014the management of public information\u2014to private entities.

Far from demonstrating robust oversight, these documents paint the AEC as a reactive, under-resourced, and fundamentally dependent entity, seemingly outmatched and outmanoeuvred by the very tech giants it purports to regulate.\n\n**Key Failures and Damning Implications:**\n\n1.  **Abject Failure to Proactively Engage and Utilise Critical Channels:**\n    *   **TikTok Debacle:** The most damning revelation is the AEC's explicit **rejection of a verified TikTok account** in July 2021, just months before the 2022 election. The stated reason \u2013 \"limited capacity\" and inability to \"properly invest the time and effort\" \u2013 is an astonishing admission of **profound strategic incompetence or severe under-resourcing**. By forsaking a direct communication channel to a vast, impressionable youth demographic, the AEC willfully ceded vital ground to mis/disinformation, demonstrating a catastrophic failure to adapt to modern electoral landscapes. They even punted the idea to \"the federal election after this one,\" indicating a shocking lack of urgency and foresight.\n    *   **Refusal to Invest in Fact-Checking:** The AEC explicitly states it \"won\u2019t be able to invest into something similar\" to TikTok\u2019s fact-checking partnership with Agence France-Presse (AFP). This is a dereliction of duty, abandoning direct, independent verification in favour of vague \"cohesive working arrangements\" with platforms whose primary incentive is engagement, not truth.\n\n2.  **Alarming Lack of Transparency and Public Accountability:**\n    *   **Rejection of Public Declaration:** Unlike the Canadian government, which partnered with TikTok and other platforms on a public \"Declaration on Electoral Integrity,\" the AEC \"is not necessarily a public statement.\" This preference for an opaque, private \"Online Media \u2013 Elections Protocol\" indicates a **deliberate avoidance of public accountability**, fostering an environment where critical agreements remain hidden from public scrutiny and trust is eroded.\n\n3.  **Reactive, Last-Minute, and Disorganised Planning:**\n    *   **Late Engagement on Core Issues:** Critical activities such as developing and finalising \"electoral communications escalation scenarios\" with TikTok and Facebook only occur in August-November 2021 \u2013 mere months before the election. This signifies a **chaotic, reactive approach** rather than a well-planned, proactive strategy to counter electoral interference.\n    *   **Ignorance of Platform Mechanisms:** The AEC's requests to Facebook in June-July 2021 for information on \"specific requirements for processing each request\" on their new reporting portal, and asking if \"more than one mailbox with portal access\" is possible, demonstrate a shocking **lack of preparedness and internal coordination**. They are playing catch-up, needing basic education on how to *use* the very mechanisms meant to protect electoral integrity, highlighting a fundamental failure in establishing essential operational channels in advance.\n    *   **Reliance on Platform Education:** Emails show Facebook offering \"selected briefing session from Facebook on misinformation / disinformation\" and a \"virtual tour of the Transparency and Accountability Centre.\" The AEC's acceptance of these indicates a **disturbing dependence on the platforms themselves to educate the regulator**, rather than the AEC possessing its own independent expertise or demanding specific, enforceable actions.\n\n4.  **Grossly Insufficient Engagement with Key Platforms:**\n    *   **Google and LinkedIn Neglect:** The FOI response reveals a shocking paucity of correspondence with Google (a single, generic email from June 2020) and **no documents whatsoever for LinkedIn**. Given the pervasive influence of these platforms in information dissemination and professional discourse, this glaring omission suggests either **profound incompetence in engagement or a deliberate redaction/concealment** of more substantive, potentially embarrassing, interactions. The scope of the FOI request explicitly included these platforms, yet the output is minimal, implying the AEC is not comprehensively addressing risks across the digital landscape.\n\n5.  **Vague Outcomes and Obfuscated Detail:**\n    *   The pervasive use of generic subject lines like \"EIAT and Twitter follow up,\" \"Follow up from last meeting,\" and \"Electoral integrity preparations\" throughout the documents offers **no concrete insight into specific threats, discussions, or resolved issues**. This deliberate vagueness, compounded by heavy redactions (e.g., s 22, s 47G(1), s 37(1)), suggests a calculated effort to conceal the true extent of vulnerabilities or the inadequacy of the AEC's responses. The government's actions appear designed more for optics than for effective electoral security.\n\nIn summary, these documents provide a damning indictment of the AEC's approach to digital electoral integrity. They reveal an agency that is unprepared, under-resourced, technologically behind, and overly reliant on the goodwill and reactive measures of powerful, self-interested tech corporations. The deliberate choices to avoid public accountability and neglect crucial communication channels point to a systemic failure that significantly undermines public confidence in the integrity of Australian elections.", "model": "gemini-2.5-flash", "generated_at": "2025-06-22T14:26:47.559265", "source_hash": "b8d04fe24e7c75d95d0bcc9d260599703234c40653440c079b880688be33332c", "raw_response_path": "data/llm_responses/LEX1697__overall__highly_critical__20250622T142647.json", "output_tokens": 1081, "prompt_tokens": 74190, "total_tokens": 77360, "summary_length": 5573}, "short_index": {"text": "The Australian Electoral Commission's FOI release on its 2022 Federal election social media engagement exposes a damning picture of systemic failure, crippling incompetence, and a disturbing lack of transparency.
