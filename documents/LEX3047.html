      <p>The following is a summary of the documents released under FOI Request No. LEX3047:</p>
<h3>Main Purpose of the FOI Request</h3>
<p>The main purpose of the FOI request (LEX3047, dated 20 June 2022) was to obtain specific documents from the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) related to complaints concerning electoral advertisements. Specifically, the requester sought:<br />
*   A copy of the original complaint.<br />
*   The final AEC correspondence to the relevant third-party regarding the matter.</p>
<p>The request focused on complaints made mostly in April and May 2019 concerning a lack of authorisation on electoral advertisements, or in one instance, misleading and deceptive content.</p>
<h3>Documents from the FOI Request</h3>
<p>The released documents comprise:<br />
*   A "Schedule of Released Documents" listing the specific complaints for which documents were provided.<br />
*   Copies of email complaints submitted by members of the public to the AEC's Legal Services Mailbox or specific AEC personnel.<br />
*   Copies of email correspondence from the AEC's Authorisation Section to the individuals or entities that were the subject of the complaints.</p>
<p>The released documents correspond to complaints made against various entities, including:<br />
*   "Our Vote Our Community" Facebook Page<br />
*   "Bass Deserves Better" Facebook Page<br />
*   "Outrage Institute" Facebook Page<br />
*   "RiteOn!" website and social media<br />
*   " for WILLS" Facebook page<br />
*   "Friends of the ABC" website<br />
*   "South Perth Progressive" Facebook page<br />
*   "Agents in their Community" Facebook page<br />
*   "Vote Tony Out" Facebook page and website<br />
*   Unspecified "Liberal Party" other media<br />
*   An "Independent candidate" (website and print media)</p>
<h3>Main Content from the FOI Request Documents</h3>
<p>The released documents primarily detail complaints about the lack of proper authorisation on political advertising and the AEC's subsequent responses, largely focusing on compliance with the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918.</p>
<p><strong>Key Themes from Complaints:</strong><br />
*   <strong>Lack of Authorisation:</strong> The vast majority of complaints allege that electoral matter, whether on Facebook pages, websites, or other media (online ads, newspaper ads, merchandise), lacked the required authorisation details (name and town/city of the authorising person/entity).<br />
*   <strong>Misleading Nature:</strong> Some complaints highlight that pages purporting to be "community groups" or "apolitical" were in fact engaged in partisan political campaigning without transparent authorisation, leading to concerns about misleading voters.<br />
*   <strong>Paid Advertising:</strong> Several complaints specifically note that paid advertisements were being run without authorisation.<br />
*   <strong>Disclosure Entities:</strong> Complaints occasionally touched upon whether the entity disseminating the information should be considered a "disclosure entity" under the Electoral Act, which would necessitate authorisation for all electoral communications.</p>
<p><strong>Key Content from AEC Correspondence:</strong><br />
*   <strong>Clarification of Requirements:</strong> The AEC's responses consistently explain the definition of 'electoral matter' and the requirements for authorisation under the Electoral Act, particularly for paid advertisements and communications by 'disclosure entities' (e.g., registered political parties, candidates, or entities exceeding electoral expenditure thresholds).<br />
*   <strong>Specific Observations and Requests:</strong> For each complaint deemed valid, the AEC identifies the specific issues (e.g., unauthorised stickers, unapproved Facebook ads, missing website authorisations). They formally request the subject of the complaint to add the necessary authorisation (e.g., in the "About" section of social media pages, website footers) and, where applicable, to cease the sale or distribution of unauthorised material.<br />
*   <strong>Consequences of Non-Compliance:</strong> The AEC often informs the recipients of potential penalties for non-compliance (e.g., up to $25,200) and the possibility of injunctions being sought by other nominated candidates if the non-compliance persists after an election is called.<br />
*   <strong>Guidance on Disclosure Entities:</strong> The AEC advises entities that if their electoral expenditure exceeds the disclosure threshold (e.g., $13,800), they would become a "disclosure entity" with further obligations, including providing disclosure returns and authorising all electoral communications.</p>

    <div class="ai-summary-markdown-content">
      <p>These FOI documents from the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) paint a concerning picture of the pervasive lack of transparency in Australian political advertising, particularly in the digital sphere, raising significant questions about social justice, wealth distribution, corporate influence, and the integrity of civil liberties in a democratic society.</p>
<p>The core issue highlighted across numerous complaints is the widespread failure of various entities – from political parties and independent candidates to seemingly 'community' or 'advocacy' groups – to properly authorise their electoral communications on social media and websites. This directly undermines progressive values centered on an informed public and equitable democratic participation. Without clear authorisation, the public is denied the fundamental right to know <em>who</em> is attempting to influence their vote. This opacity disproportionately benefits well-resourced actors, allowing them to exert undue influence, often without disclosing their financial backing or vested interests. Examples include complaints about a "community group" for "South Perth Progressive" allegedly run by a Labor Party member without explicit party authorisation, or a "Bass Deserves Better" page run by a union member, both potentially appearing as grassroots movements while having partisan affiliations. Such 'astroturfing' obfuscates the true source of political messaging, distorting public discourse and eroding trust in the democratic process, which is a key social justice concern.</p>
<p>While the documents do not explicitly detail environmental advertising, the demonstrated prevalence of unauthored political content creates a significant vulnerability for environmental advocacy. Powerful corporate interests, particularly those with significant environmental impacts (e.g., fossil fuel industries), could exploit such loopholes to run undeclared campaigns influencing policy or public opinion without accountability, thereby undermining progressive environmental goals. The repeated nature of these complaints suggests that the current system allows for significant corporate or wealthy individual influence to operate under the radar, impacting wealth distribution by ensuring policy outcomes favour those with undisclosed financial power.</p>
<p>The documents reveal that the AEC is actively receiving and responding to these complaints, often requesting compliance with authorisation requirements and noting potential penalties. This indicates an alignment with the progressive value of upholding the <em>letter</em> of the law. However, the sheer volume of complaints and the explicit frustration voiced by some complainants – such as the statement "I expect sweet fuck all to occur. The complaint process is just to make people feel like the rules are being upheld" – point to a system that is, at best, reactive and, at worst, perceived as ineffective. This reactive enforcement, rather than proactive monitoring and robust penalties, represents a deviation from progressive ideals of strong regulatory oversight necessary to safeguard the democratic process from the distorting effects of wealth and hidden corporate influence. The current framework appears insufficient to ensure genuine transparency and accountability in political campaigning, leaving the door open for veiled persuasion that undermines the foundational principles of a just and equitable society and the civil liberty of informed democratic participation.</p>

    <div class="ai-summary-markdown-content">
      <p>The provided FOI documents illustrate the Australian Electoral Commission's (AEC) pervasive role in regulating political communications, primarily through enforcing authorization requirements for electoral advertisements. From a right-leaning perspective, several issues related to core conservative principles emerge:</p>
<p><strong>Individual Liberty and Free Speech:</strong> The documents reveal a broad application of regulations requiring authorization on political communications across a wide spectrum of entities, from established political parties and candidates to various grassroots and advocacy groups like "Our Vote Our Community," "Friends of the ABC," and "Vote Tony Out." While the stated aim is transparency ("voters know who is communicating electoral matter to them"), the extensive reach of these requirements into social media pages and informal communications raises concerns about the potential chilling effect on individual liberty and free speech. These regulations impose a burden on individuals and small groups to identify themselves, which could be seen as an undue government intrusion into the spontaneous expression of political opinion.</p>
<p><strong>Limited Government and Bureaucratic Overreach:</strong> The sheer volume of complaints and the AEC's active correspondence to enforce authorization rules highlight a significant bureaucratic apparatus dedicated to policing political communication. This demonstrates an expansive role for government in an area traditionally considered within the realm of free association and speech. The complexity of determining what constitutes an "advertisement" or a "disclosure entity" (e.g., an entity spending over $13,800 on electoral communications) suggests an intricate regulatory framework. One complainant's cynical remark that the process exists "just to make people feel like the rules are being upheld" suggests a perception of bureaucratic inefficiency and potentially a process that is more about appearance than effective enforcement, hinting at overreach without proportionate impact.</p>
<p><strong>Economic Efficiency and Fiscal Responsibility:</strong> The regulatory burden imposed by these authorization requirements creates economic inefficiencies. Individuals, independent candidates, and small advocacy groups face compliance costs in understanding and adhering to complex rules regarding content authorization and disclosure thresholds. This can disproportionately affect less-resourced political actors, potentially stifling their ability to participate effectively in public discourse and creating an uneven playing field that favors well-funded entities with dedicated legal support. Furthermore, the extensive process of fielding, investigating, and responding to numerous complaints represents an expenditure of taxpayer funds. From a fiscal responsibility standpoint, this raises questions about whether the significant resources dedicated to regulating individual and small-group political expression yield a proportionate benefit to electoral integrity.</p>
<p>In summary, the documents reveal government actions and policies that, while ostensibly aimed at transparency in elections, lean towards increased regulation of political speech. This deviates from conservative principles advocating for individual liberty by burdening free expression, potentially expands the scope of government beyond limited core functions, and introduces economic inefficiencies through compliance costs and bureaucratic expenditure.</p>

    <div class="ai-summary-markdown-content">
      <p>These FOI documents reveal a snapshot of the Australian Electoral Commission's (AEC) reactive approach to policing transparency in political advertising during an election period, primarily highlighting a significant volume of complaints regarding unauthorised electoral communications.</p>
<p>The documents list numerous complaints filed with the AEC in April and May 2019, detailing concerns across various platforms including Facebook pages, websites, and other media. These complaints frequently allege a lack of proper authorisation on electoral matter, but also raise deeper issues of potential deception, such as pages purporting to be apolitical community groups ("Bass Deserves Better," "South Perth Progressive," "Agents in their Community") while actively engaging in partisan campaigning, often linked to specific political actors or unions. One complainant explicitly criticises this, stating the page is "misleading as it being used to campaign against the Liberals and conservatives, on the premise that Labor is the only party to support."</p>
<p>The AEC's response, as evidenced by its correspondence, appears to be consistently one of advisory requests rather than immediate enforcement or penalties. For instance, entities are "requested" to add authorisations, or "advised" to cease selling unauthorised merchandise, with the AEC seeking an email confirmation of compliance. This reactive, "please comply" approach is explicitly called into question by one complainant who writes, "As per my last complaint, I expect sweet fuck all to occur. The complaint process is just to make people feel like the rules are being upheld." This sentiment directly challenges the effectiveness and integrity of the AEC's regulatory oversight.</p>
<p>The scope of complaints, ranging from major parties (Liberal, Labor candidate for Mitchell) to independent candidates and various activist or "community" pages, suggests a widespread issue of non-compliance with authorisation laws during elections. The AEC's reliance on complaints rather than proactive monitoring, combined with its seemingly lenient enforcement, raises questions about whether the current system adequately ensures transparency and prevents deliberate misinformation or "astroturfing" by political entities hiding behind ostensibly neutral fronts. The redaction of some organisation names and personal details in the released documents further impedes full public scrutiny of how these complaints are resolved and whether enforcement is applied consistently across the political spectrum.</p>

    <div class="ai-summary-markdown-content">
      <p>The FOI documents highlight the Australian Electoral Commission's (AEC) robust and transparent commitment to upholding the integrity of the electoral process, particularly concerning the critical issue of authorisation of political communications. The initial Freedom of Information request itself underscores the government's dedication to openness, providing public access to records of how diligently the AEC manages its regulatory responsibilities.</p>
<p>The documents reveal a period in April-May 2019 where the AEC actively addressed numerous public complaints regarding the absence of proper authorisation on various electoral materials. These complaints, originating from diverse sources including concerns about Facebook pages (e.g., "Our Vote Our Community," "Bass Deserves Better," "Vote Tony Out," "Friends of the ABC"), websites, and other media associated with political parties, independent candidates, and community-oriented groups, demonstrate the breadth of the AEC's oversight.</p>
<p>In response to these challenges, the AEC acted swiftly and decisively, showcasing effective governance in action. Instead of punitive measures, the AEC primarily adopted an educative approach. Correspondence sent to the identified parties, such as "Friends of the ABC," "Vote Tony Out," and a former candidate operating "for WILLS" Facebook pages, meticulously outlined the legal requirements under the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918. These communications clarified complex definitions like "electoral matter" and "disclosure entity," demonstrating the AEC's proactive efforts to help entities comply with necessary regulations.</p>
<p>The core purpose of these regulations, consistently reinforced by the AEC, is to ensure that voters are fully informed about the source of electoral communications. This transparency is vital for public trust and informed democratic participation. By requesting the immediate addition of authorisation details—such as the name and city of the person responsible for the content—to websites, social media pages, and even merchandise like stickers, the AEC ensures a fair and accountable informational landscape for electors.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the AEC's communications gently reminded parties of potential penalties for non-compliance and the avenues for legal action by other nominated candidates, emphasizing the seriousness with which these regulations are enforced to maintain an equitable campaigning environment.</p>
<p>In summary, these documents portray a government agency, the AEC, effectively managing the dynamic environment of electoral communications. Through prompt investigation, clear guidance, and a steadfast commitment to transparency and compliance, the AEC consistently works to uphold the democratic standards and serve the public interest by ensuring a well-regulated and trustworthy electoral process.</p>

    <div class="ai-summary-markdown-content">
      <p>The released FOI documents paint a damning picture of the Australian Electoral Commission's (AEC) systemic failures in regulating electoral communications, revealing a pattern of inaction, incompetence, and a seeming reluctance to enforce the very laws it is mandated to uphold. Far from being a robust guardian of electoral integrity, the AEC appears to operate as a passive, advisory service, exhibiting a profound abdication of its core responsibilities.</p>
<p><strong>1. Systemic Failure to Act and Concealment of Inaction:</strong><br />
The most glaring indictment is the sheer volume of complaints for which the AEC has provided <em>only</em> the initial complaint, with <strong>no corresponding "final AEC correspondence" or evidence of action</strong>. Of the eleven distinct complaints for which documents were provided, a staggering <strong>eight</strong> lack any discernible AEC response or outcome. These include critical allegations:<br />
*   <strong>"South Perth Progressive" (7 May 2019):</strong> A highly detailed complaint outlining a deliberate attempt to mislead voters by a Facebook page "purporting to be a community group" running <em>paid political advertising</em> without proper authorisation, directly linked to a Labor Party member. The complete absence of an AEC response implies either deliberate inaction on a politically sensitive matter or a catastrophic failure in record-keeping.<br />
*   <strong>Liberal Party "Other media" (10 May 2019):</strong> A direct complaint against a major political party for unauthorised advertising. The lack of any AEC response strongly suggests preferential treatment or a calculated avoidance of challenging powerful entities.<br />
*   <strong>"Our Vote Our Community" (12 April 2019):</strong> Accusations of "no authorisation for misleading ads," left unaddressed.<br />
*   <strong>Independent Candidate (14 April 2019 - two complaints):</strong> Two distinct complaints regarding both a website and a print advertisement lacking authorisation. The AEC's silence suggests a wholesale disregard for compliance from an independent candidate.<br />
*   <strong>"Bass Deserves Better" (18 April 2019):</strong> A complaint explicitly detailing a Facebook page run by "a known senior union member" masquerading as an "apolitical group" to campaign against conservatives without authorisation. The AEC's failure to provide any response here points to a shocking lack of will to address sophisticated attempts at voter manipulation, particularly when connected to organised political interests.<br />
*   <strong>"RiteOn!" &amp; "Outrage Institute" (18 April 2019):</strong> Allegations that these pages and websites, strongly linked to the Liberal Party, were operating without authorisation. The absence of an AEC response allows a damning inference of deliberate inaction when faced with politically inconvenient complaints.<br />
*   <strong>"Agents in their Community" (17 May 2019):</strong> This complaint is uniquely damning as the complainant explicitly states: "As per my last complaint, I expect sweet fuck all to occur. The complaint process is just to make people feel like the rules are being upheld." The AEC's subsequent failure to provide a response to <em>this specific complaint</em> serves as a self-fulfilling prophecy of their own ineffectiveness and validates the public's direct contempt for their complaint process.</p>
<p>The AEC's inability or refusal to provide "final correspondence" for the majority of requested complaints points to either a deep-seated incompetence in maintaining proper records of enforcement actions or a cynical, calculated decision to withhold evidence of pervasive inaction.</p>
<p><strong>2. A Regulator Without Teeth: Passive Advisories and Burden Shifting:</strong><br />
For the few complaints where AEC correspondence <em>is</em> provided ("Friends of the ABC," "Vote Tony Out," "<strong><em>*</em><em> - for WILLS"), the AEC's approach is revealed to be astonishingly weak and non-committal. Instead of issuing directives or initiating punitive measures, the AEC adopts a passive, advisory tone:<br />
*   In the "Friends of the ABC" case, the AEC merely "received a </em>further<em> complaint," implying previous inaction, then proceeds to "request" the alleged offender to "please consider" and "advise by reply email" on their </em>own* compliance. This is a ludicrous abdication of investigative responsibility, forcing the alleged offender to self-assess their lawfulness.<br />
*   For "Vote Tony Out" and "</strong><em><em><em><em> - for WILLS," the AEC's letters, while more detailed, still amount to polite requests for self-correction by a specified deadline. They "recommend" actions and vaguely mention potential penalties or the ability for </em>other candidates</em> (not the AEC itself) to seek injunctions. There is no evidence of the AEC issuing fines, mandating content removal, or pursuing legal action themselves. This portrays the AEC as a toothless tiger, a body that merely issues warnings rather than genuinely enforcing the law.<br />
*   The AEC's lengthy explanations of legal definitions and disclosure thresholds to alleged offenders effectively serve as a guide for avoiding compliance or a warning to rectify issues </em>before</em> any real AEC-initiated enforcement occurs, rather than a genuine investigation into past breaches.</p>
<p><strong>3. The Illusion of Oversight:</strong><br />
The cumulative effect of these documents is a strong impression that the AEC's complaint process is less about robust regulation and more about creating a performative "theatre" of oversight. Complainants expend effort to identify breaches, but the AEC consistently fails to demonstrate meaningful follow-through. This undermines the democratic process by allowing a climate where electoral rules, particularly regarding transparency of funding and authorship, can be flouted with apparent impunity.</p>
<p>In conclusion, these FOI documents expose an Australian Electoral Commission that is critically flawed. Its systematic failure to provide evidence of action on the majority of complaints, coupled with its demonstrably weak, advisory-only approach when it does respond, points to an institution either woefully incompetent in its duties or deliberately complicit in allowing electoral deception to flourish unchecked. The cynical assessment of the process by a frustrated complainant resonates powerfully, confirming that the AEC is widely perceived as a regulator that exists merely to maintain the illusion of electoral integrity.</p>

RE: Friends of the ABC electoral advertising  Attention 
[SEC=UNCLASSIFIED]

The AEC has received a further complaint that abcfriends.org.au, specifically the page 
https://me.abcfriends.org.au/index.php/2019/04/25/queensland-how-to-vote-report-card-on-parties/, contains 
electoral matter but does not contain an authorisation for the purpose of the Electoral Act.  

Specifically for electronic media, where electoral matter is (a) an advertisement and all or part of the distribution or 
production of the advertisement was paid for, or (b) the matter is communicated by, or on behalf of, a disclosure 
entity, an authorisation is required. 

Whilst advertisement is not defined in the Electoral Act, it is defined in other Commonwealth legislation as, broadly, 
any matter that draws the attention of the public, or a segment of the public, to a product, service, person, 
organisation or line of conduct in a manner calculated to promote or oppose, directly or indirectly, that product, 
service, person, organisation or line of conduct. 

If part of the distribution or production of abcfriends.org.au was paid for, or Friends of the ABC will meet the 
definition of a disclosure entity under the Electoral Act, could you please add an authorisation to the website, 
preferably to the footer of each page or to the ‘About’ section? 

For background, a person or entity is a disclosure entity at a particular time if the person or entity is any of the 
following at that time: 

(a) a registered political party; 
(aa) a political campaigner (within the meaning of Part XX); 
(ab) a third party (within the meaning of Part XX); 
(b) an associated entity (within the meaning of Part XX); 
(c) a senator or a member of the House of Representatives; 
(d) a candidate in an election or by-election; 
(e) a person who was a candidate in: 

(i) an election or by-election of a member of the House of Representatives in the previous 4 years; 

or 

(ii) an election of Senators for a State or Territory in the previous 7 years; 

(f) a group of 2 or more candidates nominated for election to the Senate who have their names grouped in 

the ballot papers in accordance with section 168; 

(g) a person or entity who: 

(i) is or will be required to provide a return under section 305A or 305B for the financial year in 

which the time occurs; or 

(ii) based on conduct in previous financial years, may be required to provide a return under section 

305A or 305B for the financial year in which the time occurs; 
except if the return is provided because of electoral expenditure incurred solely for the purposes of carrying 
out an opinion poll, or other research, relating to an election or the voting intentions of electors. 

If you could please consider the above and advise by reply email either that abcfriends.org.au was not paid for and 
Friends of the ABC will not meet the definition of a disclosure entity and therefore the website does not requires an 
authorisation, or that one of the circumstances mentioned above does apply and an authorisation will be added to 
the website?

                    <h3>Document Summary</h3>
<ul>
<li>This document is an email from the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) Authorisation Section, dated 6 May 2019, responding to a complaint regarding the website <code>abcfriends.org.au</code>.</li>
<li>The complaint alleges that a specific page on the website, containing a "Queensland how-to-vote report card on parties," displays electoral matter but lacks the required authorisation under the Commonwealth Electoral Act.</li>
<li>The AEC clarifies that authorisation is required for electronic media if the distribution or production of the advertisement was paid for, or if the matter is communicated by or on behalf of a "disclosure entity."</li>
<li>The email provides a broad definition of "advertisement" and a detailed list of criteria for an entity to be considered a "disclosure entity" under the Electoral Act.</li>
<li>The AEC requests "Friends of the ABC" to either add an authorisation to their website (preferably in the footer or 'About' section) if either of the conditions (paid content or disclosure entity status) applies, or to advise if neither condition applies and authorisation is therefore not required.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Relevance to FOI Request LEX3047</h3>
<ul>
<li>This document is directly relevant as it constitutes an AEC response to a complaint about an electoral advertisement lacking authorisation, aligning with the core subject matter of FOI Request LEX3047.</li>
<li>It demonstrates the AEC's standard procedure for addressing such complaints, specifically concerning digital platforms and the absence of authorisation details, which is a key focus of the FOI request.</li>
<li>The communication falls within the specified timeframe of complaints primarily in April and May 2019.</li>
<li>It illustrates the AEC's consistent approach of clarifying the definition of 'electoral matter' and authorisation requirements under the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918, and advising entities on compliance.</li>

Complaint Details 

I draw your attention to the Friends of the ABC Queensland How-to-vote card which can be found 
at https://me.abcfriends.org.au/index.php/2019/04/25/queensland-how-to-vote-report-card-on-
parties/ This does not appear to contain an authorisation. The use of an Australian Government 
trademark (the ABC logo) has the potential to mislead voters as to the source of the electoral 
matter. 

Expected Outcome 

Request the Friends of the ABC to desist from circulating unauthorised material.

                    <h3>Summary of Document:</h3>
<p>This document is a public email complaint dated May 5, 2019, concerning political advertising. The complainant alleges that a "How-to-vote card" distributed online by "Friends of the ABC Queensland" lacks proper authorisation. Furthermore, the complaint highlights that the use of the ABC logo (an Australian Government trademark) on the material has the potential to mislead voters regarding the source of the electoral matter. The expected outcome requested is for "Friends of the ABC" to cease circulating the unauthorised material.</p>
<h3>Relevance to FOI Request LEX3047:</h3>
<p>This document is directly relevant to FOI Request LEX3047 as it constitutes a complaint made in May 2019 about electoral advertising. Specifically, it aligns with the FOI's scope by addressing two key concerns: the absence of required authorisation details on political advertising and the potential for material to be misleading through the alleged misuse of a government trademark, which could portray it as from an official source or a community group. The nature of the complaint—lack of authorisation and misleading content—directly reflects the types of issues the AEC consistently clarified and acted upon as described in the FOI request overview.</p>

Subject: Incorrectly authorised advertising 

@aec.gov.au&gt; 

Hi 

I’m hoping you can provide some advice on the following Facebook Page: https://www.facebook.com/South-
Perth-Progressive-389307874990668/ 

The Facebook Page is purporting to be a community group and is running paid political advertising into Swan. 

Here’s a link to the unauthorised video: https://www.facebook.com/389307874990668/videos/435215877282051/ 

(Note: Some other ads on the Facebook Page are correctly authorised by the Labor Party.) 

In the about section, it claims to be authorised by a ‘

Salter Point’. 

 is a Member of the WA Labor Party and heavily involved in their campaign in Swan. 

I’m unsure how this information changes the authorisation requirements, but in addition to being very misleading 
by purporting to be a community group that now actively involved in political advocacy and not providing an address 
in the authorisation, the fact 
the authorisation? 

 is heavily involved in Labor’s campaign might also need to be identified in 

We don’t want to draw public attention to the Page, but would like some assistance to rectify the issue. 

Are you able to let me know if the Page fails to meet the Electoral Commission’s authorisation requirements? This 
will also be helpful when I contact Facebook.

                    <p>This document is an email complaint sent to the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) on May 7, 2019, regarding a Facebook page named "South Perth Progressive." The complaint alleges the page is misleadingly portraying itself as a community group while running paid political advertising in the electorate of Swan. Specific concerns raised include the absence of a full address in the authorisation, the omission of the authoriser's affiliation with the WA Labor Party despite their heavy involvement in the Swan campaign, and the general misleading nature of the "community group" portrayal for paid political content. The sender seeks AEC advice on whether these issues constitute a failure to meet electoral authorisation requirements.</p>
<p>This document is highly relevant to FOI Request LEX3047 as it directly aligns with the request's focus on AEC documents concerning complaints made in April-May 2019 about electoral advertisements lacking authorisation or being misleading. Specifically, it exemplifies a public email complaint highlighting the absence of required authorisation details (full address, full disclosure of authoriser's political involvement) on digital political advertising and concerns about misleading "community group" portrayals, which are key themes identified in the FOI request overview.</p>

                    <h3>Document Summary: Complaint Regarding Unauthorised Online Advertisement</h3>
<p>This document is an email complaint sent to the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) Legal Services Mailbox on 10 May 2019. The complainant reported encountering an online advertisement, purportedly from "Liberal," while reading the "NewDaily" online newspaper. The core of the complaint is that this advertisement lacked any authorisation details or links to a website, despite having sufficient space for such information. The complainant requested that the AEC demand proper authorisation for such advertisements and compel the responsible organisation to cease further unauthorised advertising.</p>
<h3>Relevance to FOI Request LEX3047:</h3>
<p>This document is directly relevant to FOI Request LEX3047 as it constitutes an example of the "public email complaints" received by the AEC concerning electoral advertisements. Specifically, it falls within the requested timeframe (May 2019) and addresses a primary concern of the FOI request: the "absence of required authorisation details on political advertising across digital... platforms." The nature of the complaint and the requested outcome align with the AEC's standard responses and enforcement actions outlined in the FOI request overview, which involved clarifying authorisation requirements and requesting subjects to add necessary authorisations or cease distribution of non-compliant materials.</p>

<p>This document is an email complaint submitted to the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) Legal Services Mailbox on April 13, 2019.

It serves as a primary example of the type of input the AEC received, leading to their subsequent actions as detailed in the FOI request overview (e.g., clarifying authorisation requirements and advising on non-compliance).</p>

<p>This document is an email complaint, dated April 14, 2019, lodged with the Australian Electoral Commission's (AEC) Legal Services. The complaint concerns an independent candidate for the seat of Curtin, alleging their website lacks the required authorisations for electoral communications. The complainant requests the AEC provide advice on enforcement steps, remind the candidate of legal obligations, and monitor their compliance.</p>
<p><strong>Relevance to FOI Request LEX3047:</strong> This document is highly relevant as it falls squarely within the scope of FOI Request LEX3047. The request specifically covers AEC documents concerning complaints made primarily in April and May 2019 about electoral advertisements lacking authorisation. This complaint directly addresses the absence of required authorisation details on a digital platform (a candidate's website) and originates within the specified timeframe. It represents a common type of complaint the AEC would receive and respond to by clarifying authorisation requirements under the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 and seeking compliance.</p>

                    <h3>Document Summary</h3>
<p>This document is an email complaint dated April 14, 2019, received by the "Legal Services Mailbox," concerning political advertising. The complaint alleges that an advertisement published on page 7 of the April 13, 2019 edition of <em>The Cambridge Post</em>, supporting an independent candidate for the seat of Curtin, lacked the required authorisation particulars. The complainant requested that the candidate be reminded of their legal obligations and their compliance continuously monitored.</p>
<h3>Relevance to FOI Request LEX3047</h3>
<p>This document is directly relevant to FOI Request LEX3047 as it constitutes a public email complaint made in April 2019 about an electoral advertisement lacking authorisation details in a print publication (<em>The Cambridge Post</em>). This aligns precisely with the FOI request's focus on complaints from April-May 2019 regarding electoral advertisements, specifically highlighting the absence of required authorisation details on print platforms. The requested outcome by the complainant also mirrors the AEC's typical responses described in the FOI overview, such as reminding subjects of their obligations.</p>

Complaint Details

There is a social media page on Facebook named &#34;Bass Deserves Better&#34;, posting 
and sharing union political messages. the page is run by a known senior union 
&#39; (who is a Industrial Organiser at CPSU Tasmania) , as found 
member 
by scrolling through hundreds of posts I found that 
 was running it. The page is 
misleading as it being used to campaign against the Liberals and conservatives, on 
the premise that Labor is the only party to support. 

The issue is, the page is clearly being run by union members as away to reach 
voters in &#39;Bass&#39;, but has no &#39;authorised&#39; message anywhere on the page. For the 
average voter they would see this page as being run by an apolitical group, but that 
is not the case.

Should this page be authorised by either Greene or the Union? As is the case with 
other union campaign pages. 

Link to page &#34; https://www.facebook.com/BassDeservesBetter/ &#34;

Expected Outcome

Should this page be authorised, or is it exempt, if so how come? reach out to the 

47F47F47F47F47F47F47F47F47F


--- Page 2 ---

group by telling them they are required to be authorised to stop misleading voters 
that they are apolitical.

                    <p>This document is an email complaint dated April 18, 2019, to the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) concerning the Facebook page "Bass Deserves Better." The complainant alleges the page, run by a senior union member, is misleading voters by presenting as apolitical while campaigning against Liberals and for Labor, and crucially, lacks the required authorisation details. The complainant requests the AEC to determine if the page requires authorisation and to contact the group to address the non-compliance.</p>
<p><strong>Relevance to FOI Request:</strong> This document directly aligns with the FOI request LEX3047, which covers AEC documents regarding complaints in April-May 2019 about electoral advertisements lacking authorisation or being misleading. The complaint specifically targets "Bass Deserves Better" for its absence of authorisation and misleading "community group" portrayal, echoing the core themes of the FOI request.</p>

Dear 
We are writing to notify you of our concerns that the website https://www.riteon.org.au/ and its 
accompanying Facebook page https://www.facebook.com/RiteOnAU, its twitter page 
https://twitter.com/RiteOnAU and instagram page https://www.instagram.com/RiteOnAU/   are not 
authorised. All platforms are being used to disseminate opinions on electoral matters. 
The nature of the content strongly indicates that the website originated from the Liberal Party, or from 
people with connections to the Liberal Party. We are deeply concerned as to why the authorising party is 
not stated, as we have interpreted the law to require them to be.  

The only identifiable information from the website is that of a mobile telephone listed as:

                    <p>This email, dated 26 March 2019, is a complaint submitted to the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) concerning the website "www.riteon.org.au" and its associated Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram pages. The complaint alleges that these platforms disseminate opinions on electoral matters without the required authorisation details, specifically noting the absence of a stated authorising party despite the content strongly suggesting a connection to the Liberal Party.</p>
<p><strong>Relevance to FOI Request LEX3047:</strong> This document is highly relevant as it is a public email complaint received by the AEC about electoral advertisements lacking authorisation, directly aligning with the core scope of the FOI request. The complaint explicitly targets "RiteOn!" platforms, which are specifically listed in the request overview as entities whose complaints were part of the released materials, and highlights the central issue of missing authorisation details on digital political advertising.</p>

Dear 

The Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) has received complaints regarding unauthorised electoral content and 
merchandise being distributed by the “Vote Tony Out” website –  https://www.votetonyout.com/, and unauthorised 
advertising on the “Vote Tony Out” Facebook page – https://www.facebook.com/votetonyout/. 

The Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 (Electoral Act) is concerned, among other things, that voters know who is 
communicating electoral matter to them.  The AEC does not provide legal advice on how to comply with the 
Electoral Act, however, I offer the following observations in relation to the authorisation requirements in the 
Act.  The Electoral Backgrounder: Electoral communications and authorisation requirements on the AEC website 
provides more information.  

The Electoral Act requires the communication of certain electoral matters to be authorised.  ‘Electoral matter’ is 
defined in section 4AA(1) of the Electoral Act to be a matter communicated or intended to be communicated for the 
dominant purpose of influencing the way electors vote in a federal election. 

A communication containing electoral matter must be authorised if it is: 

  a paid electoral advertisement, or 

  a sticker, fridge magnet, leaflet, flyer, pamphlet, notice, poster or how-to-vote card, or 

  a matter communicated by or on behalf of a disclosure entity (e.g. a candidate, Senator or Member of the 
House of Representatives, registered political party, an associated entity or other person or group who is 
required to submit a return under Part XX of the Electoral Act). 

It is an offence under section 321D(5) of the Electoral Act to make these types of electoral communications without 
proper authorisation.   

The AEC has checked the Vote Tony Out campaign sites and identified the following issues. 

Authorisation of Vote Tony Out stickers 

The stickers for sale on the Vote Tony Out website contain electoral matter that requires authorisation under 
section 321D(1)(b) of the Electoral Act.  Can you please stop selling and distributing the unauthorised stickers.  The 
other merchandise for sale on the website does not need to be authorised. 

Authorisation of Vote Tony Out Facebook page 

The Vote Tony Out Facebook page is currently running paid advertising promoting the Vote Tony Out rally on 
5 May.  This electoral advertising needs to be authorised or have a link to an authorised Facebook page.  The 
authorisation of a social media site only needs the name and city of the person authorising the site.  The 
authorisation can be added to the “About” section in a Facebook page. 

Authorisation of Vote Tony Out website 

1

47F47F


--- Page 2 ---

I note you have an authorisation on the Mail chimp webpage supporting the Vote Tony Out website.  To be prudent 
I recommend adding this authorisation to the bottom of the Vote Tony Out website (alongside the copyright notice) 
and/or on the website “About” page. 

Whether Vote Tony Out is or will become a third party (disclosure entity) for the purpose of the Electoral Act 

As noted above a disclosure entity must authorise all electoral communications.  A ‘disclosure entity’ is defined in 
section 321B of the Electoral Act to include a person or entity who will incur electoral expenditure during a financial 
year above the disclosure threshold (currently $13,800). 

If you think you will spend more than $13,8000 this financial year on electoral communications then you will need to 
provide a disclosure return to the AEC under Part XX of the Electoral Act and also must authorise all your electoral 
communications.  There are also other obligations on third parties in the Electoral Act, such as restrictions on 
receiving foreign donations.  

Actions 

Can you please: 

  Stop the sale and distribution of unauthorised Vote Tony Out stickers from the Vote Tony Out website.  If 

you want to sell more stickers, the stickers will need to have an authorisation added. 

  Authorise any paid electoral advertising on social media or elsewhere 

  Authorise the Vote Tony Out Facebook page and website (and if the Vote Tony Out Twitter site and 

Instagram page are also running paid electoral advertising or you think you will become a disclosure entity 
for the purpose of the Electoral Act, these sites should also include an authorisation)  

Can you please take this action by COB Monday 29 April and advise the AEC of this action. 

Yours sincerely

                    <h2>Document Summary</h2>
<p>This document is an email from the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) to "info@votetonyout.com," dated 24 April 2019, concerning complaints about unauthorised electoral content and advertising from the "Vote Tony Out" website and Facebook page.</p>
<p>Key points include:<br />
*   The AEC notes the receipt of complaints regarding unauthorised electoral content and merchandise, and unauthorised advertising.<br />
*   It identifies specific issues: "Vote Tony Out" stickers for sale contain electoral matter requiring authorisation under section 321D(1)(b) of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918, and their Facebook page is running unauthorised paid electoral advertising.<br />
*   The email clarifies the definition of 'electoral matter' (section 4AA(1) of the Electoral Act) and outlines types of communications requiring authorisation, including paid advertisements, certain merchandise (stickers, leaflets), and matters from 'disclosure entities'.<br />
*   It advises on potential 'disclosure entity' status if electoral expenditure exceeds $13,800, which entails further obligations such as disclosure returns and authorising all communications.<br />
*   The AEC instructs "Vote Tony Out" to stop the sale and distribution of unauthorised stickers, authorise all paid electoral advertising, and add authorisations to their Facebook page and website.<br />
*   "Vote Tony Out" is requested to take these actions by COB Monday 29 April 2019 and advise the AEC of compliance.</p>
<h2>Relevance to FOI Request</h2>
<p>This document is highly relevant to FOI Request LEX3047 as it directly reflects the AEC's handling of complaints about electoral advertisements lacking authorisation.</p>
<p>Its relevance stems from:<br />
*   <strong>Direct Response to Complaints:</strong> It is an AEC communication (response) to complaints received in April 2019 regarding political advertising, fitting the timeframe and nature of the FOI request.<br />
*   <strong>Focus on Authorisation:</strong> The primary concern addressed is the absence of required authorisation details on political advertising across digital (Facebook, website) and merchandise (stickers) platforms, which is a core theme of the FOI request.<br />
*   <strong>AEC's Consistent Approach:</strong> The AEC's actions align with the described consistent responses in the FOI overview, including clarifying 'electoral matter' and authorisation requirements under the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918, requesting subjects to add necessary authorisations, and advising on potential obligations for "disclosure entities."</p>

Dear 

I draw to your attention the website www.votetonyout.com which is selling a range of merchandise in the context of 
the forthcoming federal election. 

In particular, the merchandise features messages calling for voters to vote out the Liberal candidate for Warringah, 
Tony Abbott, and alternatively supporting the independent candidate, Zali Steggall. 

I note that neither the website, nor the merchandise being sold through the website (that requires authorisation), 
contains the required particulars in accordance with Part XXA of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 (‘the Act’).   

According to a search of ASIC records of the ABN listed on the website 
OUT was registered on 5/04/2019 to a 

 of 

 the business VOTE TONY 

. 

I would ask that the AEC investigates this breach of the Act and take appropriate action if warranted.

Authorisation of electoral communications [SEC=UNCLASSIFIED]

I am writing to you on behalf of the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC). 

The AEC has received a complaint that the 
&amp; Architect to the Very Rich &amp; Worthy’ Facebook pages do not include an authorisation as required by the 
Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 (Electoral Act). 

 for WILLS’ and 

 Thinker Politician 

Certain communications of electoral matter are required to include an authorisation under the Electoral Act so that 
voters know who is communicating electoral matter to them. 

The definition of ‘electoral matter’ in the Electoral Act means: 

matter communicated or intended to be communicated for the dominant purpose of influencing the way 
electors vote in an election (a federal election) of a member of the House of Representatives or of Senators 
for a State or Territory, including by promoting or opposing: 

(a) a political entity, to the extent that the matter relates to a federal election; or 
(b) a member of the House of Representatives or a Senator. 

Communications of electoral matter where all or part of the distribution or production of an electoral advertisement 
was paid for, or the electoral matter is communicated by, or on behalf of, a disclosure entity, is required to include 
an authorisation. These obligations are contained in sections 321D(1) and (5) of the Electoral Act. The definition of 
‘disclosure entity’ includes, amongst others, a senator or member of the House of Representatives, a person who is 
a candidate in an election or by-election, or a person who was a candidate in an election or by-election of a member 
of the House of Representatives in the previous 4 years, or an election of Senators for a State or Territory in the 
previous 7 years.  

We note that you stood as a candidate in the division of Wills in the 2016 federal election and as such, all 
communications of electoral matter by, or on behalf of, yourself are required by the Electoral Act to include an 
authorisation. We also note that some of your posts are currently being sponsored as advertisements which also 
require an authorisation. 

Relevantly for websites and social media, the authorisation must include: 

(a) the name of the person who either approved the content of the electoral matter before it was 

communicated, or otherwise the person that communicated the electoral matter; and 

(b) the relevant town or city of the person. 

More information on the authorisation requirements is in the Electoral Backgrounder on the AEC website. If you 
require clarification, the AEC recommends you seek independent legal advice. 

Can you please address these omissions by adding the required authorisation to the ‘About’ section of the 

 Thinker Politician &amp; Architect to the Very Rich &amp; Worthy’ 
Facebook pages by COB this Wednesday 1 May 2019 and send a reply email to authorisationsection@aec.gov.au 
once this is done?

Failure to authorise electoral communications where required can result in a penalty of up to $25,200. One further 
point to note on the authorisation of electoral matter; whilst the Electoral Act enables the AEC to seek an injunction 
against an electoral communication that does not meet the requirements in the Electoral Act, now that the federal 
election has been called, the Electoral Act enables other persons who have been nominated as candidates to also 
seek an injunction against any unauthorised electoral communications.

                    <p>This document is an email from the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) dated 26 April 2019, informing an individual that a complaint was received regarding their Facebook pages, " for WILLS" and " Thinker Politician &amp; Architect to the Very Rich &amp; Worthy," for lacking required authorisations on electoral communications. The AEC explains that as the recipient was a candidate in the 2016 federal election (making them a "disclosure entity") and some posts are sponsored advertisements, all electoral matter they communicate must include authorisation under sections 321D(1) and (5) of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918. The email defines 'electoral matter' and specifies that authorisations must include the name of the person who approved/communicated the content and their town/city. The AEC requests the recipient add the authorisations by 1 May 2019, cautioning about potential penalties up to $25,200 and the possibility of injunctions for non-compliance.</p>
<p>This document is highly relevant to FOI Request LEX3047 as it directly aligns with the request's scope for AEC documents concerning complaints in April-May 2019 about electoral advertisements lacking authorisation. It exemplifies the AEC's process for handling such complaints, demonstrating their consistent approach of: clarifying 'electoral matter' and authorisation requirements, advising on compliance obligations for 'disclosure entities' (like past candidates), requesting subjects to add necessary authorisations, and warning of potential penalties for non-compliance. This case specifically involves digital platforms (Facebook pages) and addresses the absence of required authorisation details, directly reflecting the core themes of the FOI request.</p>

                    <h3>Document Summary: Complaint Regarding "for WILLS" Facebook Page</h3>
<p>This document is an email complaint sent to the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) on April 23, 2019, concerning political advertising. The complaint, originating from the electoral division of Holt, alleges that the Facebook page "for WILLS" (facebook.com/pg/for-WILLS-2337394036272646/) carries no authorisation or contact details. It further states that the page engages in specific anti-Greens and Labor political commentary, including personal imputation. The complainant requests that the page name be changed to indicate it is an individual's page, not a political candidate's, or that it be taken down.</p>
<h3>Relevance to FOI Request LEX3047</h3>
<p>This document is directly relevant to FOI Request LEX3047 as it is an example of a public email complaint received by the AEC in April 2019 regarding electoral advertisements. The complaint specifically highlights two key themes central to the FOI request:<br />
1.  <strong>Absence of required authorisation details:</strong> The primary grievance is the lack of authorisation or contact details on a page making political commentary.<br />
2.  <strong>Misleading portrayal:</strong> The request for the page name to be changed to clarify it's an individual, not a political candidate, aligns with concerns about "misleading 'community group' portrayals" or misrepresentation.</p>
<p>This document serves as a specific instance of the types of public complaints the AEC received that prompted their responses concerning compliance with authorisation requirements and the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918, as detailed in the FOI request overview.</p>

The AEC does not provide legal advice on how to comply with the \nElectoral Act, however, I offer the following observations in relation to the authorisation requirements in the \nAct.  The Electoral Backgrounder: Electoral communications and authorisation requirements on the AEC website \nprovides more information.  \n\nThe Electoral Act requires the communication of certain electoral matters to be authorised.  \u2018Electoral matter\u2019 is \ndefined in section 4AA(1) of the Electoral Act to be a matter communicated or intended to be communicated for the \ndominant purpose of influencing the way electors vote in a federal election. \n\nA communication containing electoral matter must be authorised if it is: \n\n\uf0b7  a paid electoral advertisement, or \n\n\uf0b7  a sticker, fridge magnet, leaflet, flyer, pamphlet, notice, poster or how-to-vote card, or \n\n\uf0b7  a matter communicated by or on behalf of a disclosure entity (e.g. a candidate, Senator or Member of the \nHouse of Representatives, registered political party, an associated entity or other person or group who is \nrequired to submit a return under Part XX of the Electoral Act). \n\nIt is an offence under section 321D(5) of the Electoral Act to make these types of electoral communications without \nproper authorisation.   \n\nThe AEC has checked the Vote Tony Out campaign sites and identified the following issues. \n\nAuthorisation of Vote Tony Out stickers \n\nThe stickers for sale on the Vote Tony Out website contain electoral matter that requires authorisation under \nsection 321D(1)(b) of the Electoral Act.  Can you please stop selling and distributing the unauthorised stickers.  The \nother merchandise for sale on the website does not need to be authorised. \n\nAuthorisation of Vote Tony Out Facebook page \n\nThe Vote Tony Out Facebook page is currently running paid advertising promoting the Vote Tony Out rally on \n5 May.  This electoral advertising needs to be authorised or have a link to an authorised Facebook page.  The \nauthorisation of a social media site only needs the name and city of the person authorising the site.  The \nauthorisation can be added to the \u201cAbout\u201d section in a Facebook page. \n\nAuthorisation of Vote Tony Out website \n\n1\n\n47F47F\n\n\n--- Page 2 ---\n\nI note you have an authorisation on the Mail chimp webpage supporting the Vote Tony Out website.  To be prudent \nI recommend adding this authorisation to the bottom of the Vote Tony Out website (alongside the copyright notice) \nand/or on the website \u201cAbout\u201d page. \n\nWhether Vote Tony Out is or will become a third party (disclosure entity) for the purpose of the Electoral Act \n\nAs noted above a disclosure entity must authorise all electoral communications.  A \u2018disclosure entity\u2019 is defined in \nsection 321B of the Electoral Act to include a person or entity who will incur electoral expenditure during a financial \nyear above the disclosure threshold (currently $13,800). \n\nIf you think you will spend more than $13,8000 this financial year on electoral communications then you will need to \nprovide a disclosure return to the AEC under Part XX of the Electoral Act and also must authorise all your electoral \ncommunications.  There are also other obligations on third parties in the Electoral Act, such as restrictions on \nreceiving foreign donations.  \n\nActions \n\nCan you please: \n\n\uf0b7  Stop the sale and distribution of unauthorised Vote Tony Out stickers from the Vote Tony Out website.  If \n\nyou want to sell more stickers, the stickers will need to have an authorisation added. \n\n\uf0b7  Authorise any paid electoral advertising on social media or elsewhere \n\n\uf0b7  Authorise the Vote Tony Out Facebook page and website (and if the Vote Tony Out Twitter site and \n\nInstagram page are also running paid electoral advertising or you think you will become a disclosure entity \nfor the purpose of the Electoral Act, these sites should also include an authorisation)  \n\nCan you please take this action by COB Monday 29 April and advise the AEC of this action. \n\nYours sincerely \n\n | Principal Government Lawyer \n\nElectoral Authorisation Section | Legal & Procurement Branch \nAustralian Electoral Commission \nT: \n\n2\n\n47FSection 47F"}, {"type": "pdf", "output_file_path": "/downloaded_originals/22042019 Vote Tony Out Facebook page regards request to authorise - DOC 2.pdf", "content_files": [], "extracted_text_path": "/extracted_texts/LEX3047_22042019 Vote Tony Out Facebook page regards request to authorise - DOC 2.txt", "ai_summaries": {"balanced": {"text": "This document is an email complaint dated April 20, 2019, sent to the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) concerning electoral material lacking proper authorisation.

Specifically, the requester sought:\n*   A copy of the original complaint.\n*   The final AEC correspondence to the relevant third-party regarding the matter.\n\nThe request focused on complaints made mostly in April and May 2019 concerning a lack of authorisation on electoral advertisements, or in one instance, misleading and deceptive content.\n\n### Documents from the FOI Request\nThe released documents comprise:\n*   A \"Schedule of Released Documents\" listing the specific complaints for which documents were provided.\n*   Copies of email complaints submitted by members of the public to the AEC's Legal Services Mailbox or specific AEC personnel.\n*   Copies of email correspondence from the AEC's Authorisation Section to the individuals or entities that were the subject of the complaints.\n\nThe released documents correspond to complaints made against various entities, including:\n*   \"Our Vote Our Community\" Facebook Page\n*   \"Bass Deserves Better\" Facebook Page\n*   \"Outrage Institute\" Facebook Page\n*   \"RiteOn!\" website and social media\n*   \" for WILLS\" Facebook page\n*   \"Friends of the ABC\" website\n*   \"South Perth Progressive\" Facebook page\n*   \"Agents in their Community\" Facebook page\n*   \"Vote Tony Out\" Facebook page and website\n*   Unspecified \"Liberal Party\" other media\n*   An \"Independent candidate\" (website and print media)\n\n### Main Content from the FOI Request Documents\nThe released documents primarily detail complaints about the lack of proper authorisation on political advertising and the AEC's subsequent responses, largely focusing on compliance with the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918.\n\n**Key Themes from Complaints:**\n*   **Lack of Authorisation:** The vast majority of complaints allege that electoral matter, whether on Facebook pages, websites, or other media (online ads, newspaper ads, merchandise), lacked the required authorisation details (name and town/city of the authorising person/entity).\n*   **Misleading Nature:** Some complaints highlight that pages purporting to be \"community groups\" or \"apolitical\" were in fact engaged in partisan political campaigning without transparent authorisation, leading to concerns about misleading voters.\n*   **Paid Advertising:** Several complaints specifically note that paid advertisements were being run without authorisation.\n*   **Disclosure Entities:** Complaints occasionally touched upon whether the entity disseminating the information should be considered a \"disclosure entity\" under the Electoral Act, which would necessitate authorisation for all electoral communications.\n\n**Key Content from AEC Correspondence:**\n*   **Clarification of Requirements:** The AEC's responses consistently explain the definition of 'electoral matter' and the requirements for authorisation under the Electoral Act, particularly for paid advertisements and communications by 'disclosure entities' (e.g., registered political parties, candidates, or entities exceeding electoral expenditure thresholds).\n*   **Specific Observations and Requests:** For each complaint deemed valid, the AEC identifies the specific issues (e.g., unauthorised stickers, unapproved Facebook ads, missing website authorisations). They formally request the subject of the complaint to add the necessary authorisation (e.g., in the \"About\" section of social media pages, website footers) and, where applicable, to cease the sale or distribution of unauthorised material.\n*   **Consequences of Non-Compliance:** The AEC often informs the recipients of potential penalties for non-compliance (e.g., up to $25,200) and the possibility of injunctions being sought by other nominated candidates if the non-compliance persists after an election is called.\n*   **Guidance on Disclosure Entities:** The AEC advises entities that if their electoral expenditure exceeds the disclosure threshold (e.g., $13,800), they would become a \"disclosure entity\" with further obligations, including providing disclosure returns and authorising all electoral communications.", "model": "gemini-2.5-flash", "generated_at": "2025-06-22T14:03:18.328813", "source_hash": "8d75e3c03a57cf8f7f5a2a53e4e5eb42fcb0304504ff51bd4f4d4fcea49da442", "raw_response_path": "data/llm_responses/LEX3047__overall__balanced__20250622T140318.json", "output_tokens": 867, "prompt_tokens": 8211, "total_tokens": 12157, "summary_length": 4327}, "short_index": {"text": "FOI Request LEX3047 obtained Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) documents concerning complaints made primarily in April and May 2019 about electoral advertisements lacking authorisation or being misleading.

This directly undermines progressive values centered on an informed public and equitable democratic participation. Without clear authorisation, the public is denied the fundamental right to know *who* is attempting to influence their vote. This opacity disproportionately benefits well-resourced actors, allowing them to exert undue influence, often without disclosing their financial backing or vested interests. Examples include complaints about a \"community group\" for \"South Perth Progressive\" allegedly run by a Labor Party member without explicit party authorisation, or a \"Bass Deserves Better\" page run by a union member, both potentially appearing as grassroots movements while having partisan affiliations. Such 'astroturfing' obfuscates the true source of political messaging, distorting public discourse and eroding trust in the democratic process, which is a key social justice concern.\n\nWhile the documents do not explicitly detail environmental advertising, the demonstrated prevalence of unauthored political content creates a significant vulnerability for environmental advocacy. Powerful corporate interests, particularly those with significant environmental impacts (e.g., fossil fuel industries), could exploit such loopholes to run undeclared campaigns influencing policy or public opinion without accountability, thereby undermining progressive environmental goals. The repeated nature of these complaints suggests that the current system allows for significant corporate or wealthy individual influence to operate under the radar, impacting wealth distribution by ensuring policy outcomes favour those with undisclosed financial power.\n\nThe documents reveal that the AEC is actively receiving and responding to these complaints, often requesting compliance with authorisation requirements and noting potential penalties. This indicates an alignment with the progressive value of upholding the *letter* of the law. However, the sheer volume of complaints and the explicit frustration voiced by some complainants \u2013 such as the statement \"I expect sweet fuck all to occur. The complaint process is just to make people feel like the rules are being upheld\" \u2013 point to a system that is, at best, reactive and, at worst, perceived as ineffective. This reactive enforcement, rather than proactive monitoring and robust penalties, represents a deviation from progressive ideals of strong regulatory oversight necessary to safeguard the democratic process from the distorting effects of wealth and hidden corporate influence.

From a right-leaning perspective, several issues related to core conservative principles emerge:\n\n**Individual Liberty and Free Speech:** The documents reveal a broad application of regulations requiring authorization on political communications across a wide spectrum of entities, from established political parties and candidates to various grassroots and advocacy groups like \"Our Vote Our Community,\" \"Friends of the ABC,\" and \"Vote Tony Out.\" While the stated aim is transparency (\"voters know who is communicating electoral matter to them\"), the extensive reach of these requirements into social media pages and informal communications raises concerns about the potential chilling effect on individual liberty and free speech. These regulations impose a burden on individuals and small groups to identify themselves, which could be seen as an undue government intrusion into the spontaneous expression of political opinion.\n\n**Limited Government and Bureaucratic Overreach:** The sheer volume of complaints and the AEC's active correspondence to enforce authorization rules highlight a significant bureaucratic apparatus dedicated to policing political communication. This demonstrates an expansive role for government in an area traditionally considered within the realm of free association and speech. The complexity of determining what constitutes an \"advertisement\" or a \"disclosure entity\" (e.g., an entity spending over $13,800 on electoral communications) suggests an intricate regulatory framework. One complainant's cynical remark that the process exists \"just to make people feel like the rules are being upheld\" suggests a perception of bureaucratic inefficiency and potentially a process that is more about appearance than effective enforcement, hinting at overreach without proportionate impact.\n\n**Economic Efficiency and Fiscal Responsibility:** The regulatory burden imposed by these authorization requirements creates economic inefficiencies. Individuals, independent candidates, and small advocacy groups face compliance costs in understanding and adhering to complex rules regarding content authorization and disclosure thresholds. This can disproportionately affect less-resourced political actors, potentially stifling their ability to participate effectively in public discourse and creating an uneven playing field that favors well-funded entities with dedicated legal support. Furthermore, the extensive process of fielding, investigating, and responding to numerous complaints represents an expenditure of taxpayer funds. From a fiscal responsibility standpoint, this raises questions about whether the significant resources dedicated to regulating individual and small-group political expression yield a proportionate benefit to electoral integrity.\n\nIn summary, the documents reveal government actions and policies that, while ostensibly aimed at transparency in elections, lean towards increased regulation of political speech. This deviates from conservative principles advocating for individual liberty by burdening free expression, potentially expands the scope of government beyond limited core functions, and introduces economic inefficiencies through compliance costs and bureaucratic expenditure.", "model": "gemini-2.5-flash", "generated_at": "2025-06-22T14:03:58.396205", "source_hash": "8d75e3c03a57cf8f7f5a2a53e4e5eb42fcb0304504ff51bd4f4d4fcea49da442", "raw_response_path": "data/llm_responses/LEX3047__overall__right_leaning__20250622T140358.json", "output_tokens": 541, "prompt_tokens": 8202, "total_tokens": 9943, "summary_length": 3459}, "short_index": {"text": "From a right-leaning perspective, the Australian Electoral Commission's (AEC) extensive regulation of political communications, primarily through authorization requirements, presents a significant challenge to core conservative principles.

The initial Freedom of Information request itself underscores the government's dedication to openness, providing public access to records of how diligently the AEC manages its regulatory responsibilities.\n\nThe documents reveal a period in April-May 2019 where the AEC actively addressed numerous public complaints regarding the absence of proper authorisation on various electoral materials. These complaints, originating from diverse sources including concerns about Facebook pages (e.g., \"Our Vote Our Community,\" \"Bass Deserves Better,\" \"Vote Tony Out,\" \"Friends of the ABC\"), websites, and other media associated with political parties, independent candidates, and community-oriented groups, demonstrate the breadth of the AEC's oversight.\n\nIn response to these challenges, the AEC acted swiftly and decisively, showcasing effective governance in action. Instead of punitive measures, the AEC primarily adopted an educative approach. Correspondence sent to the identified parties, such as \"Friends of the ABC,\" \"Vote Tony Out,\" and a former candidate operating \"for WILLS\" Facebook pages, meticulously outlined the legal requirements under the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918. These communications clarified complex definitions like \"electoral matter\" and \"disclosure entity,\" demonstrating the AEC's proactive efforts to help entities comply with necessary regulations.\n\nThe core purpose of these regulations, consistently reinforced by the AEC, is to ensure that voters are fully informed about the source of electoral communications. This transparency is vital for public trust and informed democratic participation. By requesting the immediate addition of authorisation details\u2014such as the name and city of the person responsible for the content\u2014to websites, social media pages, and even merchandise like stickers, the AEC ensures a fair and accountable informational landscape for electors.\n\nFurthermore, the AEC's communications gently reminded parties of potential penalties for non-compliance and the avenues for legal action by other nominated candidates, emphasizing the seriousness with which these regulations are enforced to maintain an equitable campaigning environment.\n\nIn summary, these documents portray a government agency, the AEC, effectively managing the dynamic environment of electoral communications. Through prompt investigation, clear guidance, and a steadfast commitment to transparency and compliance, the AEC consistently works to uphold the democratic standards and serve the public interest by ensuring a well-regulated and trustworthy electoral process.", "model": "gemini-2.5-flash", "generated_at": "2025-06-22T14:04:37.292486", "source_hash": "8d75e3c03a57cf8f7f5a2a53e4e5eb42fcb0304504ff51bd4f4d4fcea49da442", "raw_response_path": "data/llm_responses/LEX3047__overall__government_apologist__20250622T140437.json", "output_tokens": 486, "prompt_tokens": 8202, "total_tokens": 9990, "summary_length": 2838}, "short_index": {"text": "The very existence of this FOI request underscores the government's unwavering commitment to openness, revealing how the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC), a beacon of effective governance, diligently upholds electoral integrity.

Far from being a robust guardian of electoral integrity, the AEC appears to operate as a passive, advisory service, exhibiting a profound abdication of its core responsibilities.\n\n**1. Systemic Failure to Act and Concealment of Inaction:**\nThe most glaring indictment is the sheer volume of complaints for which the AEC has provided *only* the initial complaint, with **no corresponding \"final AEC correspondence\" or evidence of action**. Of the eleven distinct complaints for which documents were provided, a staggering **eight** lack any discernible AEC response or outcome. These include critical allegations:\n*   **\"South Perth Progressive\" (7 May 2019):** A highly detailed complaint outlining a deliberate attempt to mislead voters by a Facebook page \"purporting to be a community group\" running *paid political advertising* without proper authorisation, directly linked to a Labor Party member. The complete absence of an AEC response implies either deliberate inaction on a politically sensitive matter or a catastrophic failure in record-keeping.\n*   **Liberal Party \"Other media\" (10 May 2019):** A direct complaint against a major political party for unauthorised advertising. The lack of any AEC response strongly suggests preferential treatment or a calculated avoidance of challenging powerful entities.\n*   **\"Our Vote Our Community\" (12 April 2019):** Accusations of \"no authorisation for misleading ads,\" left unaddressed.\n*   **Independent Candidate (14 April 2019 - two complaints):** Two distinct complaints regarding both a website and a print advertisement lacking authorisation. The AEC's silence suggests a wholesale disregard for compliance from an independent candidate.\n*   **\"Bass Deserves Better\" (18 April 2019):** A complaint explicitly detailing a Facebook page run by \"a known senior union member\" masquerading as an \"apolitical group\" to campaign against conservatives without authorisation. The AEC's failure to provide any response here points to a shocking lack of will to address sophisticated attempts at voter manipulation, particularly when connected to organised political interests.\n*   **\"RiteOn!\" & \"Outrage Institute\" (18 April 2019):** Allegations that these pages and websites, strongly linked to the Liberal Party, were operating without authorisation. The absence of an AEC response allows a damning inference of deliberate inaction when faced with politically inconvenient complaints.\n*   **\"Agents in their Community\" (17 May 2019):** This complaint is uniquely damning as the complainant explicitly states: \"As per my last complaint, I expect sweet fuck all to occur. The complaint process is just to make people feel like the rules are being upheld.\" The AEC's subsequent failure to provide a response to *this specific complaint* serves as a self-fulfilling prophecy of their own ineffectiveness and validates the public's direct contempt for their complaint process.\n\nThe AEC's inability or refusal to provide \"final correspondence\" for the majority of requested complaints points to either a deep-seated incompetence in maintaining proper records of enforcement actions or a cynical, calculated decision to withhold evidence of pervasive inaction.\n\n**2. A Regulator Without Teeth: Passive Advisories and Burden Shifting:**\nFor the few complaints where AEC correspondence *is* provided (\"Friends of the ABC,\" \"Vote Tony Out,\" \"****** - for WILLS\"), the AEC's approach is revealed to be astonishingly weak and non-committal. Instead of issuing directives or initiating punitive measures, the AEC adopts a passive, advisory tone:\n*   In the \"Friends of the ABC\" case, the AEC merely \"received a *further* complaint,\" implying previous inaction, then proceeds to \"request\" the alleged offender to \"please consider\" and \"advise by reply email\" on their *own* compliance. This is a ludicrous abdication of investigative responsibility, forcing the alleged offender to self-assess their lawfulness.\n*   For \"Vote Tony Out\" and \"****** - for WILLS,\" the AEC's letters, while more detailed, still amount to polite requests for self-correction by a specified deadline. They \"recommend\" actions and vaguely mention potential penalties or the ability for *other candidates* (not the AEC itself) to seek injunctions. There is no evidence of the AEC issuing fines, mandating content removal, or pursuing legal action themselves. This portrays the AEC as a toothless tiger, a body that merely issues warnings rather than genuinely enforcing the law.\n*   The AEC's lengthy explanations of legal definitions and disclosure thresholds to alleged offenders effectively serve as a guide for avoiding compliance or a warning to rectify issues *before* any real AEC-initiated enforcement occurs, rather than a genuine investigation into past breaches.\n\n**3. The Illusion of Oversight:**\nThe cumulative effect of these documents is a strong impression that the AEC's complaint process is less about robust regulation and more about creating a performative \"theatre\" of oversight. Complainants expend effort to identify breaches, but the AEC consistently fails to demonstrate meaningful follow-through. This undermines the democratic process by allowing a climate where electoral rules, particularly regarding transparency of funding and authorship, can be flouted with apparent impunity.\n\nIn conclusion, these FOI documents expose an Australian Electoral Commission that is critically flawed. Its systematic failure to provide evidence of action on the majority of complaints, coupled with its demonstrably weak, advisory-only approach when it does respond, points to an institution either woefully incompetent in its duties or deliberately complicit in allowing electoral deception to flourish unchecked. The cynical assessment of the process by a frustrated complainant resonates powerfully, confirming that the AEC is widely perceived as a regulator that exists merely to maintain the illusion of electoral integrity.", "model": "gemini-2.5-flash", "generated_at": "2025-06-22T14:05:23.493958", "source_hash": "8d75e3c03a57cf8f7f5a2a53e4e5eb42fcb0304504ff51bd4f4d4fcea49da442", "raw_response_path": "data/llm_responses/LEX3047__overall__highly_critical__20250622T140523.json", "output_tokens": 1225, "prompt_tokens": 8199, "total_tokens": 15162, "summary_length": 6233}, "short_index": {"text": "The FOI documents savagely expose the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) as a critically flawed, utterly toothless regulator of electoral communications, demonstrating a profound abdication of its core responsibilities rather than robust guardianship of integrity.
