<p>The documents reveal ongoing collaboration and communication between the AEC (specifically its Electoral Integrity Assurance Taskforce - EIAT) and major social media platforms concerning electoral integrity, misinformation, and compliance with Australian electoral law, particularly in anticipation of the 2022 Federal Election.</p>
<p><strong>Key Themes and Content:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Collaboration and Engagement:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The AEC proactively initiated engagement with platforms post-2019 election to prepare for the upcoming 2022 Federal Election, focusing on mutual understanding and collaboration.</li>
<li>Meetings and teleconferences were scheduled and held with TikTok, Google, and Twitter to discuss policies, electoral interference, and establish communication channels.</li>
<li>The AEC's Deputy Electoral Commissioner, Jeff Pope, highlights the role of the Electoral Integrity Assurance Taskforce (EIAT) as a cross-Government cooperation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>TikTok's Initiatives:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>TikTok proposed creating an in-app 'Election Hub' for Australian users, similar to one used for the US Presidential election. This hub would provide links to the AEC's website for official information (registration, how/when/where to vote) and sought permission to use the AEC logo to signify reliability.</li>
<li>TikTok mentioned engaging in election preparation, including establishing escalation channels, dedicated Trust &amp; Safety (TnS) resources, and Public Service Announcements (PSAs).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Google's Policies and Transparency:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Google outlined its "Political Advertising Transparency Program," emphasizing advertiser compliance with local laws (e.g., election silence periods) and disclaimer requirements.</li>
<li>Google provides resources for political advertisers (policy links, Digital Garage training, verification requirements, ad disapproval appeals).</li>
<li>Google introduced transparency reports for political advertising, with Australia's report to launch in 2021, and a searchable library for election ads.</li>
<li>Google expressed willingness to discuss misinformation and shared its "How Google Fights Disinformation" document. This comprehensive document details Google's strategies:<ul>
<li><strong>Definition:</strong> Deliberate efforts to deceive and mislead using the open web.</li>
<li><strong>Three Strategies:</strong> "Make Quality Count" (ranking authoritative content), "Counteract Malicious Actors" (prohibiting misrepresentation, impersonation, coordinated activity), and "Give Users More Context" (Knowledge Panels, fact-check tags, "Full Coverage" news features, "Why this ad" labels).</li>
<li><strong>Specific Actions:</strong> Support for quality journalism (Google News Initiative), protecting elections (combating influence operations, securing accounts/websites, increasing transparency for political ads), and anticipating future risks like synthetic media ("deep fakes").</li>
<li><strong>Product-Specific Implementation:</strong> Details how these strategies are applied across Google Search, Google News, YouTube (Community Guidelines, elevating authoritative news, information panels for publisher/topical context, stricter monetization policies), and Google Advertising products.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Twitter's Engagement:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Twitter confirmed its policy of banning political and electoral advertisements, a change since the 2019 Federal Election.</li>
<li>The AEC sought a point of contact at Twitter for identifying communications that breach the Electoral Act, especially with urgency closer to polling day.</li>
<li>Meetings focused on "escalation and civic integrity policy pieces" for electoral integrity.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>AEC's "Electoral Communications Escalation Scenarios" (EIAT Document):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>This document, shared with platforms, outlines 11 scenarios of problematic electoral communications and the relevant Commonwealth laws or issues they infringe. It serves as a guide for platforms on potential breaches the AEC would raise.</li>
<li><strong>Scenarios include:</strong><ol>
<li>Paid electoral advertisement without proper authorisation (Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918, Section 321D).</li>
<li>Electoral communication misleading voters on how to cast votes (Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918, Section 329).</li>
<li>Impersonating a Commonwealth official, entity, or service (Criminal Code Act 1995, Part 7.8 – Section 150.1).</li>
<li>Electoral communication by a foreign person/entity (Foreign Influence Transparency Scheme Act 2018).</li>
<li>Foreign interference (Criminal Code Act 1995, Division 92, Part 5.2), noting the policy/operational definitions and the challenges of detection/attribution.</li>
<li>Electoral communication containing threats of terrorist action.</li>
<li>Anonymous electoral communication (unpaid) without authorisation.</li>
<li>Defamatory electoral communication.</li>
<li>Electoral communication bringing a Commonwealth agency into disrepute.</li>
<li>Electoral communication containing hate speech (Human rights, racial vilification, Online Safety Act 2021).</li>
<li>Other electoral communication not breaching Commonwealth law but breaching Platform policy (e.g., spam, false news like incorrect informal voting information).</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall, the documents demonstrate the AEC's proactive efforts to collaborate with major social media platforms to safeguard the integrity of Australian federal elections, specifically addressing issues of political advertising transparency, misinformation, disinformation, and compliance with electoral laws.</p>

    <div class="ai-summary-markdown-content">
      <p>As a left-leaning analyst, the provided FOI documents reveal a complex landscape of government engagement with major tech platforms, primarily focused on safeguarding electoral integrity against misinformation, disinformation, and foreign interference. While certain aspects align with progressive values, others highlight persistent concerns about corporate power, the nuances of civil liberties, and the limits of existing frameworks.</p>
<p><strong>Social Justice:</strong><br />
The documents show a clear alignment with social justice principles through the explicit targeting of <strong>hate speech</strong> (Scenario 10 in "Electoral communications escalation scenarios"). The AEC and platforms like Google and YouTube identify "vilification" of individuals or groups, linking it to human rights and racial vilification issues, and noting its potential to influence voters. This proactive stance against hate speech in electoral contexts is a positive step towards ensuring equitable participation and a respectful public discourse, particularly protecting vulnerable communities. Furthermore, TikTok's initiative to create an in-app "Election Hub" with verified AEC information, specifically targeting "young first time voters," aligns with progressive efforts to ensure all demographics, especially newer and potentially less informed voters, have access to accurate information for democratic participation.</p>
<p><strong>Environmental Impact:</strong><br />
These documents do <strong>not</strong> contain any information pertaining to environmental impact, as their scope is strictly limited to electoral communications and platform compliance.</p>
<p><strong>Wealth Distribution &amp; Corporate Influence:</strong><br />
Here, the picture is more mixed.<br />
*   <strong>Alignment:</strong> A significant alignment with progressive values is <strong>Twitter's policy to ban political and electoral advertisements</strong> since the 2019 Federal Election (Doc 18). This directly addresses concerns about unchecked campaign spending and the disproportionate influence of wealth and corporate power in shaping political narratives through paid media. By eliminating this avenue for financial leverage, Twitter's policy promotes a more organic and potentially equitable public debate, consistent with progressive calls for campaign finance reform. Additionally, the AEC's focus on <strong>transparency regarding paid electoral advertisements</strong> (Scenario 1) and Google's "Political Advertising Transparency Program" (Doc 12, 16), which aims to verify advertisers and disclose who is paying for ads, are positive steps towards reducing opaque financial influence in elections. Efforts to counter "foreign influence" (Scenarios 4 &amp; 5) also align with progressive concerns about external, often corporate or state-backed, actors undermining democratic sovereignty.<br />
*   <strong>Deviation/Concerns:</strong> The very nature of this FOI request, detailing extensive collaboration between the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) and tech giants like Meta, Google, Twitter, and TikTok, underscores the <strong>immense corporate power</strong> these platforms wield over public discourse. Governments are compelled to engage with them because these private entities control the modern public square, highlighting a significant concentration of influence over democratic processes. The reliance on "Platform policy" (Scenario 11) for moderating content that does not breach Commonwealth law but constitutes "spam or false news" (e.g., "Video on social media promoting informal voting that provides incorrect information") is a concerning deviation. It indicates a reliance on corporate self-regulation rather than robust public oversight, potentially allowing corporate interests or internal biases to dictate what content is permissible, which can clash with progressive demands for stronger governmental accountability over powerful industries. Google's detailed document, "How Google Fights Disinformation," while touting efforts to support journalism and combat "spam," also reiterates its core ad-based business model, which can inherently create conflicts between profit incentives and the unadulterated dissemination of information.</p>
<p><strong>Civil Liberties:</strong><br />
The documents present both protections and potential vulnerabilities for civil liberties.<br />
*   <strong>Alignment:</strong> The AEC and the platforms' shared goal to prevent communications that "mislead voters on how to cast their votes" (Scenario 2) or that "impersonates a Commonwealth official" (Scenario 3) directly safeguards the fundamental civil liberty of an informed and fair vote. The inclusion of hate speech as an escalatory scenario also contributes to creating an online environment where individuals can participate without fear of vilification, thus enhancing civil liberties for marginalized groups.<br />
*   <strong>Deviation/Concerns:</strong> The broad focus on combating "disinformation" and "false news" (e.g., Scenario 11, and Google's extensive "How Google Fights Disinformation" brief) raises significant civil liberties concerns regarding <strong>freedom of expression</strong>. While malicious disinformation is harmful, defining and policing it can be subjective and risks inadvertently suppressing legitimate, albeit unpopular, critical, or even satirical, viewpoints. Google's own document admits that "algorithms cannot determine whether a piece of content on current events is true or false," relying instead on "expertise, authority, and trustworthiness," which implicitly favors established narratives and could marginalize dissenting voices. The close <strong>government-corporate partnership in content moderation</strong> outlined through the "Electoral Integrity Assurance Taskforce" (EIAT) and the "escalation scenarios" blurs the lines between state and private power. This collaboration, while intended to protect elections, could lead to concerns about government pressure on platforms to remove content deemed "disreputable" (Scenario 9, "brings a Commonwealth agency into disrepute"), even if not illegal, potentially chilling legitimate criticism of government bodies or policies. Finally, the targeting of "Anonymous electoral communication" (Scenario 7) for "disclosure entities" could, if broadly interpreted or expanded, impinge on the right to anonymity, a crucial civil liberty that protects whistleblowers and allows individuals to express dissent without fear of reprisal.</p>
<p>In conclusion, these documents reveal government and corporate efforts to protect the integrity of the Australian democratic process, with some policies (like Twitter's ad ban and transparency efforts) clearly aligning with progressive calls for reduced corporate influence and fairer elections. However, the reliance on powerful private companies for content moderation, the inherent ambiguities in defining "disinformation," and the potential for chilling legitimate speech represent ongoing challenges for civil liberties and the balance of power in the digital public sphere.</p>

    <div class="ai-summary-markdown-content">
      <p>A review of these FOI documents reveals concerning trends regarding the Australian Electoral Commission's (AEC) engagement with major technology platforms, particularly in relation to the upcoming 2022 Federal election. While the stated goal is "electoral integrity," the revealed policies and collaborations raise significant questions about adherence to core conservative principles, particularly individual liberty and limited government.</p>
<p><strong>Individual Liberty and Limited Government:</strong><br />
The most significant deviation from conservative principles lies in the expansive scope of "electoral integrity" pursued by the AEC and its Electoral Integrity Assurance Taskforce (EIAT). The "Electoral communications escalation scenarios" document explicitly lists categories for intervention that extend far beyond breaches of Commonwealth law. Most notably, Scenario 11 targets "Any other electoral communication that may not breach a Commonwealth law, but which may breach Platform policy," citing examples like "false news." This reveals a troubling willingness of government to leverage private platforms to police and suppress speech that the government itself cannot legally prohibit. Such a mechanism effectively outsources censorship to private corporations, circumventing constitutional or statutory limitations on government power over free expression.</p>
<p>The AEC's proactive engagement with platforms like Google and Twitter to discuss "misinformation as a shared challenge" and establish "escalation pathways" indicates a desire to influence the flow of information on these platforms. Google's policy of demoting "low-quality" or "borderline" content, even if not illegal, and Twitter's ban on political advertising, while private decisions, are implicitly endorsed and engaged with by the AEC, contributing to a chilling effect on robust political discourse. This partnership risks transforming private companies into de facto arbiters of truth and acceptable political commentary, rather than neutral public squares, thereby centralizing information control and eroding individual liberty.</p>
<p><strong>National Security:</strong><br />
While addressing genuine foreign interference (Scenario 5) is a legitimate national security imperative, the documents suggest a broad interpretation of this threat, including "consistently promote divisive political positions designed to fragment the electorate." Such broad definitions could inadvertently sweep in legitimate, albeit controversial, political commentary. Of particular concern is the AEC's engagement with TikTok, a platform owned by ByteDance, a Chinese company. Despite known national security risks associated with Chinese-owned technology and potential data access by the Chinese government, the AEC is actively collaborating with TikTok to create an "Election Hub" using the AEC's logo to "signify... information is reliable." This implicit endorsement of a platform tied to an adversarial state for civic education raises serious questions about the government's prioritization of national security and the protection of sensitive data and democratic processes.</p>
<p><strong>Economic Efficiency and Fiscal Responsibility:</strong><br />
The documents suggest a significant allocation of resources by both government (AEC/EIAT) and private tech companies towards monitoring, identifying, and intervening in online communications. The acknowledgment that "Detection and attribution can be time and resource intensive" implies considerable taxpayer money is being directed towards this endeavor. Questioning content that "may not breach a Commonwealth law" but merely "breach Platform policy" represents a mission creep that could lead to inefficient spending on subjective truth-policing rather than core governmental functions. Furthermore, platforms like Twitter banning political advertising, while a private choice, distorts the market for political communication, potentially increasing campaign costs or forcing reliance on less transparent communication channels. This diverts resources from productive economic activity into regulatory compliance and content policing, raising concerns about overall economic efficiency.</p>
<p>In summary, while the stated aim is electoral integrity, the documented actions and policies suggest a concerning expansion of government influence over private discourse, a blurring of lines between state and corporate power, and a potential compromise of national security interests through engagement with questionable foreign entities. This represents a significant deviation from conservative principles advocating for individual liberty, limited government, and fiscal prudence.</p>

    <div class="ai-summary-markdown-content">
      <p>The provided FOI documents reveal a concerning level of collaboration between the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) and major tech platforms (TikTok, Google, Twitter) under the guise of "electoral integrity." This scrutiny highlights potential overreach, a blurring of lines between state and corporate control over information, and questionable decision-making.</p>
<p>Key findings suggesting waste, power abuse, or questionable decision-making include:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Co-opting Tech Platforms for Information Control:</strong> The AEC is actively engaging with foreign-owned tech giants like TikTok to shape electoral communications. TikTok's proposal to create an in-app "Election Hub" using the <strong>AEC's official logo</strong> signals a worrying level of official endorsement and trust in a platform with known data security and foreign influence concerns, potentially exposing voters to foreign narrative shaping. This also outsources the government's responsibility for civic information to a private, for-profit entity.</li>
<li><strong>Vague "Disinformation" Definitions and Potential Overreach:</strong> "OFFICIAL:Sensitive" documents outlining "Electoral communications escalation scenarios" reveal alarmingly broad definitions of "foreign interference" (e.g., social media accounts promoting "divisive political positions designed to fragment the electorate") and other problematic content. This vague language grants the AEC, and by extension the platforms, wide latitude to potentially suppress legitimate, albeit critical or unconventional, political discourse under the guise of "misleading voters" or "false news." The inclusion of "breach Platform policy" as an escalation scenario indicates the AEC leveraging private companies' terms of service for content moderation, effectively deputizing them as state censors.</li>
<li><strong>Outsourced Censorship to Unelected Tech Arbiters:</strong> Google's internal document, "How Google Fights Disinformation," highlights its own criteria for promoting "authoritative, high-quality information" and identifying "expertise, authority, and trustworthiness." This confirms that unelected tech companies are acting as de facto arbiters of "truth" in partnership with government bodies, potentially limiting the diversity of information available to voters by favouring mainstream or official narratives.</li>
<li><strong>Inefficient Bureaucracy in "Collaboration":</strong> Extensive email exchanges concerning "initial consultations" and "engagement" with tech companies, often involving multiple reschedules and clarifying basic operational points of contact, suggest significant bureaucratic inefficiency. Taxpayer resources are evidently being expended on prolonged discussions merely to establish basic communication channels, rather than on clear, actionable agreements for election integrity.</li>
<li><strong>Lack of Transparency in Enforcement:</strong> While the AEC seeks to establish "referral &amp; enquiry lines" for alleged breaches, the specific thresholds and criteria for intervention remain opaque, particularly concerning content that doesn't violate Commonwealth law but is deemed a "breach of Platform policy." The "OFFICIAL:Sensitive" classification of crucial policy documents further limits public scrutiny of how these powers are exercised.</li>

      <p>The Australian Electoral Commission (AEC), working proactively with the Electoral Integrity Assurance Taskforce (EIAT), has demonstrated robust and effective governance in safeguarding the integrity of Australia's democratic processes, particularly in anticipation of the 2022 Federal Election. These documents reveal a comprehensive, multi-faceted approach to ensuring a fair, transparent, and informed electoral environment.</p>
<p>Central to this effort is the <strong>proactive and strategic engagement</strong> with major digital platforms, including TikTok, Google, and Twitter. Far from a passive oversight, the government has actively initiated and sustained dialogues with these global technology leaders since the conclusion of the 2019 Federal Election. This foresight ensures that the digital landscape, a critical arena for public discourse, remains aligned with Australia’s electoral laws and democratic values.</p>
<p>A key highlight is the development and implementation of the <strong>"Electoral Communications Escalation Scenarios"</strong> framework. This essential document, a product of diligent work by the EIAT, meticulously identifies a wide array of potential challenges to electoral integrity – from unauthorised paid advertising and misleading voter information to foreign interference, impersonation, hate speech, and defamation. For each scenario, it clearly outlines the relevant Commonwealth laws and issues, providing a disciplined and lawful basis for intervention. This proactive risk assessment and structured response plan are hallmarks of effective governance, ensuring that the government is well-prepared to address any threats to public confidence in the electoral system.</p>
<p>The collaborations with tech companies underscore the government’s commitment to leveraging technology for the public good:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>TikTok</strong> has engaged positively with the AEC, proposing an in-app 'Election Hub' to directly provide Australian users with accurate and official electoral information, including how to register and vote. This partnership ensures that crucial civic information is readily accessible, empowering first-time and young voters with reliable data straight from the source, thereby significantly combating the spread of misinformation.</li>
<li><strong>Google</strong> has proactively outlined its Political Advertising Transparency Program to the AEC, detailing stringent policies for political ads, including verification, compliance with local laws, and measures to prevent misrepresentation. Google's comprehensive approach, as detailed in "How Google Fights Disinformation," mirrors the government's own principles of making quality information count, countering malicious actors, and providing users with essential context. The AEC's engagement with Google on issues like the Eden-Monaro by-election further demonstrates a responsive and adaptive governance model.</li>
<li><strong>Twitter</strong> has maintained consistent communication with the AEC and EIAT, establishing clear escalation pathways for addressing any content that might breach the Commonwealth Electoral Act or platform policies. This ongoing dialogue ensures rapid and coordinated responses to potential issues, safeguarding the electoral narrative from manipulation.</li>
</ul>
<p>Ultimately, these documents illustrate the government's unwavering dedication to upholding the integrity of the electoral process. By fostering robust partnerships with digital platforms, developing comprehensive policy frameworks, and maintaining a proactive stance against disinformation and electoral interference, the government continues to serve the public by safeguarding their right to a free, fair, and informed election. Any challenges encountered are met with decisive action and continuous adaptation, reflecting a strong commitment to effective and responsible governance.</p>

      <p>The FOI documents reveal a government electoral body (AEC) exhibiting a profound lack of proactive strategy, astonishing incompetence, and a deeply concerning over-reliance on the self-serving, inadequate measures of foreign tech giants. The most damning implications are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Crippling Regulatory Vacuum and Abdication of Duty:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The "Electoral communications escalation scenarios" document explicitly admits that for many critical issues, including content that misleads voters or brings agencies into disrepute, the government's legal remedies are too slow ("issue may be to stop the spread of disinformation during an election campaign").</li>
<li>Most egregiously, for content that does not breach Commonwealth law but is clearly harmful (e.g., "false news," "spam," or misinformation about informal voting), the AEC openly states it relies entirely on "Platform policy." This is a staggering admission that the Australian government has <strong>outsourced fundamental aspects of electoral integrity to the opaque, self-regulated terms of service of private, profit-driven corporations.</strong> This abdication of responsibility is a catastrophic failure of governance.</li>
<li>The document also acknowledges that "Detection and attribution [of foreign interference] can be time and resource intensive, while disinformation strategies are cheap and agile," a chilling confession of being outmatched and outmanoeuvred by malicious actors.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Alarming Lack of Engagement and Preparedness with Major Platforms:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The FOI request explicitly asked for correspondence with Meta (Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp) and LinkedIn. The retrieved schedule lists <strong>zero documents</strong> for these dominant platforms, suggesting a critical failure of engagement or, worse, a deliberate blind spot. This indicates the AEC is either utterly disengaged with the most influential online spaces or their FOI response is deliberately incomplete, both being damning.</li>
<li>For platforms where engagement <em>is</em> evidenced (Google, Twitter, TikTok), it is consistently reactive and belated.<ul>
<li><strong>Google:</strong> AEC is "chasing" Google in May 2021 to "formally begin our collaboration" for an election due between August 2021 and May 2022. Google's initial outreach in December 2020 consists of providing <em>their own</em> global policies and asking the AEC to "help us prepare for similar scenarios" by explaining past Australian "death tax issue" misinformation. This shows Google dictating the terms of engagement and relying on the AEC to educate <em>them</em> on local threats, rather than Google proactively understanding the Australian landscape. The AEC's reliance on Google's generic "How Google Fights Disinformation" (dated <em>February 2019</em>) as an FOI response document further highlights this passive, uncritical acceptance of tech company narratives. Google's document itself states their algorithms "do not identify the intent or factual accuracy of any given piece of content" and "avoiding judgments on the veracity of statements made about politics or current events" – a direct admission that their priorities conflict with robust election integrity.</li>
<li><strong>Twitter:</strong> As late as June 2020, for the Eden-Monaro by-election, the AEC was still asking Twitter to "confirm the AEC’s point of contact," revealing a shocking lack of established, direct communication channels for urgent issues. Furthermore, attempts to schedule "initial consultations" for the 2021/22 Federal Election were met with Twitter contacts being on "unavoidable leave," forcing the AEC to accommodate or reschedule, underscoring a power imbalance and a lack of depth in Twitter's Australian engagement. The AEC then segmented meetings, suggesting fragmented, less impactful discussions.</li>
<li><strong>TikTok:</strong> In January 2022, just months before the Federal election, TikTok is proactively suggesting an "Election Hub" and offering to use AEC links/logo, essentially taking the lead on civic information dissemination. TikTok itself admitted its platform "aren't really the platform to go to for politics/news," yet the AEC is shown to be relying on it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Bureaucratic Inefficiency and Lack of Urgency:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The constant back-and-forth emails for scheduling "initial" meetings, struggling with "busy calendars," and having "declined" meeting invites demonstrate internal bureaucratic lethargy and a failure to prioritize crucial pre-election engagement.</li>
<li>The existence of multiple, slightly different versions of the "Electoral communications escalation scenarios" document (e.g., dated 10 August 2021 and 29 October 2021) suggests internal disorganisation, a reactive approach to policy, or a prolonged, inefficient process to finalise critical protocols.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In summary, these documents paint a damning picture of a government agency unprepared for the realities of modern digital election interference. The AEC appears to be a minor player, reactive and largely powerless, while powerful tech companies set the terms, offer generic global solutions, and explicitly avoid assessing the truth of political content, leaving Australian electoral integrity dangerously exposed to exploitation.</p>

Hi Julie,  

Happy New Year, I hope you had a restful summer shutdown period.  

In addition to the election preparation we at TikTok have been engaging in prior to the New Year (escalation 
channels, dedicated TnS resources, PSA&#39;s), we are now also looking to create an in-app &#39;Election Hub&#39; on our 
platform.  

We created an Election Hub for the last US Presidential election, and it provides a central source of information/links 
(accessed from our Discover Page) for users on our platform to find accurate information on how to register for a 
election, when to vote, how to vote, work out where to vote etc. I have attached some examples of what it would 
roughly look like below:

--- Page 5 ---

We were hoping to be able to use links to the AEC&#39;s website (and any other publicly available resources you may 
have) that provide this information in similar fashion to the PSA&#39;s we are running with the AEC&#39;s support and if 
possible, use the AEC logo in this election hub as a link to the AEC online homepage and to signify to our users that 
the information is reliable and consistent with the AEC.  

I understand any use of logo&#39;s/branding probably needs to be run by a few people, so please let me know if I can 
provide more information or let me know if there are any concerns from the outset we can address. Whilst we arent 
really the platform to go to for politics/news we do have young first time voters on TikTok so our view internally is 
that this Election Hub would be useful for many of our Australian users.  

Kind regards

Electoral communications escalation scenarios  

Commonwealth law 
infringed/issues 
Policy:  

FI is likely to be a break of 
platforms’ own terms of use 

Operational: 

Division 92, Part 5.2 
Criminal Code Act 1995  

Detection and attribution can 
be time and resource 
intensive, while 
disinformation strategies are 
cheap and agile. 

Scenario  Description 
5 

Foreign 
interference  

This scenario 
notes the 
difference 
between the 
legislated and 
policy definitions 
of “foreign 
interference”, and 
the differing 
approaches taken 
by policy agencies 
(CFICC), and 
operational 
agencies/bodies 
(including the CFI 
Taskforce). 

Examples 
Policy:  

Social media accounts 
that appear to: 

•  amplify, then 

consistently promote 
divisive political 
positions designed to 
fragment the 
electorate, 
•  target specific 

demographics within 
the electorate with 
messaging designed to 
influence voting 
behaviour. 

Operational:  

To be actionable under 
s92, FI activity must meet 
the elements specified in 
s92, notably: 1. Conduct; 
2. done on half 
of/directed by a Foreign 
Principal; 3. to achieve 
one of the four stated 
intentions; 4. done 
covertly/deceptively/with 
menace/etc

Electoral communications escalation scenarios  

Scenario  Description 
6 

Electoral 
communication 
containing threats 
of terrorist action 

Examples 
Electoral communication 
threatening terrorist 
action against polling 
booths and/or voters. 

Commonwealth law 
infringed/issues 
Anti-terrorism laws and 
powers activated. 

7 

Anonymous 
electoral 
communication 
(other than a paid 
advertisement) 
without 
authorisation 

Anonymous 
communication 
promoting informal 
voting  

Depends on who is 
communicating the matter 
as to whether the 
communication must be 
authorised under the 
Commonwealth Electoral 
Act 1918.  An electoral 
communication must be 
authorised if it is for, or on 
behalf of, a disclosure entity 
(i.e. a candidate, political 
party or other person or 
group that is required to 
report electoral expenditure
or donations to the 
Electoral Commission under 
Part XX of the Electoral Act).

Electoral communications escalation scenarios  

Scenario  Description 
8 

Electoral 
communication 
(including a paid 
electoral ad) that 
is defamatory  

Examples 
Third party authorises a 
paid advertisement that 
defames a candidate so 
as to affect public 
perception of the 
integrity of the 
candidate, party, election 
or political system.  

Commonwealth law 
infringed/issues 
Affected individual or 
organisation can take legal 
action, however, issue may 
be to stop the spread of 
disinformation during an 
election campaign.

11 

Electoral 
communication 
(including a paid 
electoral ad) 
brings a 
Commonwealth 
agency into 
disrepute  

Third party authorises a 
paid advertisement that 
defames a 
Commonwealth agency 
or representative so as to 
affect public perception 
of the integrity of the 
electoral system. 

Affected individual or 
agency can take legal 
action, however, issue may 
be to stop the spread of 
disinformation during an 
election campaign. 

Electoral 
communication 
(including a paid 
electoral ad) 
containing hate 
speech 

Electoral communication 
on social media vilifying a 
person or group of 
people to influence 
voters. 

Vilification or freedom of 
expression on the basis of 
race, religion, nationality, 
national or ethnic origin or 
political opinion. 

Some forms of online abuse 
may meet the threshold of 
cyberbullying or adult cyber 
abuse in the Online Safety 
Act 2021 and be subject to 
removal notices issued by 
the eSafety Commissioner. 

Other communications not 
covered by scenarios 7-9, 
where no Commonwealth 
law may have been 
infringed, but the 
communication 
nevertheless is spam or 
false news. 

Video on social media 
promoting informal 
voting that provides 
incorrect information on 
the consequence of 
voting informally. 

Any other 
electoral 
communication 
that may not 
breach a 
Commonwealth 
law, but which 
may breach 
Platform policy

Subject: Google Political Advertising Transparency Program

CAUTION: This email originated from outside of the Australian Federal Government. Do not click links or open attachments
unless you recognise the sender and know the content is safe.

Hi all, 

Thanks for your time today. Google looks forward to working with the AEC on the next federal election. 

Please find below links to the information we&#39;re providing to political parties, Members and Senators. The AEC is
welcome to share these links and information with stakeholders. 

Election Advertising: 

If you intend to run election ads on Google platforms read the policy and if you need to register do so
here.  Leave at least 5 business days for approval. 
Learn how to use Google Ads via our free Digital Garage training platform. 
Individuals and organisations can be verified. See the requirements. 
Contact us to dispute an ad disapproval.
Ensure you comply with Google Ads policies including our misrepresentation policy. If you are suspended
for a violation, you can appeal here. 
If you see something amiss you can report an ad. Try to take a screenshot of what you are seeing, and to
save the URL so we can follow up as quickly as possible. 
See the existing transparency reports for countries in which Google’s program is operating. These are
updated daily. Australia’s report will launch in 2021.

Action Items

Per the discussion today, following are a couple of places where we state our expectations that all
advertisers on our platforms comply with local law. If you have any feedback about the way this is
expressed, please let me know and I will pass onto the team for consideration:

On our Google Ads policy page under political content we state that &#34;We expect all political ads and
destinations to comply with the local campaign and election laws for any area the ads target. This
policy includes legally mandated election “silence periods”.
On the page titled Verification for election advertising in Australia the current requirement reads
&#34;Attestation that the organisation applying for verification has or will satisfy the appropriate


--- Page 2 ---

disclaimer requirements under Australian law.&#34;. 

We&#39;d be happy to organise follow up discussion on misinformation as a shared challenge. It would be very
useful to understand the AEC&#39;s experience dealing with the death tax issue at the last election and
perhaps working through any other case studies you are able to share, which could help us prepare for
similar scenarios. Please let me know who I should work with at the AEC to coordinate this meeting. 
In the meantime, our YouTube misinformation approach is here and more specifically, here is some
information on how YouTube supports elections. You might recognise some of the issues as being more
relevant to the US and other countries, but it would be very helpful to understand any specific risks or
threats which may be applicable in Australia.
Please let me know if there are other ways that Google&#39;s public policy team might be able to support the
AEC as we move closer to the election. Some updates from the last federal election are here, here here,
and here to give you an idea of our work. 
I hope I&#39;ve captured everything -- let me know if not! 

I look forward to continuing the conversation. 

Yours sincerely, 

Government Affairs and Public Policy</pre>

Hi all,  

Thanks for your time today. Google looks forward to working with the AEC on the next federal election.  

Please find below links to the information we&#39;re providing to political parties, Members and Senators. The 
AEC is welcome to share these links and information with stakeholders.  

Election Advertising:

--- Page 3 ---

•€€€€€€€€ If you intend to run election ads on Google platforms read the policy and if you need to 
register do so here.  Leave at least 5 business days for approval.  

•€€€€€€€€ Learn how to use Google Ads via our free Digital Garage training platform.  

•€€€€€€€€ Individuals and organisations can be verified. See the requirements.  

•€€€€€€€€ Contact us to dispute an ad disapproval. 

•€€€€€€€€ Ensure you comply with Google Ads policies including our misrepresentation policy. If you 
are suspended for a violation, you can appeal here.  

•€€€€€€€€ If you see something amiss you can report an ad. Try to take a screenshot of what you are 
seeing, and to save the URL so we can follow up as quickly as possible.  

•€€€€€€€€ See the existing transparency reports for countries in which Google’s program is 
operating. These are updated daily. Australia’s report will launch in 2021. 

Action Items 

•  Per the discussion today, following are a couple of places where we state our expectations that all 
advertisers on our platforms comply with local law. If you have any feedback about the way this is 
expressed, please let me know and I will pass onto the team for consideration:  

o  On our Google Ads policy page under political content we state that &#34;We expect all political 
ads and destinations to comply with the local campaign and election laws for any area the 
ads target. This policy includes legally mandated election “silence periods”. 

o  On the page titled Verification for election advertising in Australia the current requirement 
reads &#34;Attestation that the organisation applying for verification has or will satisfy the 
appropriate disclaimer requirements under Australian law.&#34;.  

•  We&#39;d be happy to organise follow up discussion on misinformation as a shared challenge. It would 
be very useful to understand the AEC&#39;s experience dealing with the death tax issue at the last 
election and perhaps working through any other case studies you are able to share, which could 
help us prepare for similar scenarios. Please let me know who I should work with at the AEC to 
coordinate this meeting.  

•  In the meantime, our YouTube misinformation approach is here and more specifically, here is some 
information on how YouTube supports elections. You might recognise some of the issues as being 
more relevant to the US and other countries, but it would be very helpful to understand any specific 
risks or threats which may be applicable in Australia. 

•  Please let me know if there are other ways that Google&#39;s public policy team might be able to 

support the AEC as we move closer to the election. Some updates from the last federal election 
are here, here here, and here to give you an idea of our work.  

I hope I&#39;ve captured everything -- let me know if not!  

I look forward to continuing the conversation.  

Yours sincerely,

Introduction

The  open  Internet  has  enabled  people  to  create,  connect,  and  distribute  information  like  never  before.  It  has 
exposed us to perspectives and experiences that were previously out-of-reach. It has enabled increased access 
to knowledge for everyone.

Google continues to believe that the Internet is a boon to society – contributing to global education, healthcare, 
research, and economic development by enabling citizens to become more knowledgeable and involved through 
access to information at an unprecedented scale. 

However, like other communication channels, the open Internet is vulnerable to the organized propagation of false 
or misleading information. Over the past several years, concerns that we have entered a “post-truth” era have 
become a controversial subject of political and academic debate.

These  concerns  directly  affect  Google  and  our  mission  –  to  organize  the  world’s  information  and  make  it 
universally accessible and useful. When our services are used to propagate deceptive or misleading information, 
our mission is undermined. 

How companies like Google address these concerns has an impact on society and on the trust users place in 
our  services.  We  take  this  responsibility  very  seriously  and  believe  it  begins  with  providing  transparency  into  
our policies, inviting feedback, enabling users, and collaborating with policymakers, civil society, and academics 
around the world.

This document outlines our perspective on disinformation and misinformation and how we address it throughout 
Google. It begins with the three strategies that comprise our response across products, and an overview of our 
efforts beyond the scope of our products. It continues with an in-depth look at how these strategies are applied, 
and expanded, to Google Search, Google News, YouTube, and our advertising products. 

We welcome a dialogue about what works well, what does not, and how we can work with others in academia, 
civil society, newsrooms, and governments to meet the ever-evolving challenges of disinformation.

What is disinformation?

As we’ve all experienced over the past few years, the words “misinformation”, “disinformation”, and “fake news” 
mean different things to different people and can become politically charged when they are used to characterize 
the propagators of a specific ideology or to undermine political adversaries. 

However, there is something objectively problematic and harmful to our users when malicious actors attempt to 
deceive them. It is one thing to be wrong about an issue. It is another to purposefully disseminate information one 
knows to be inaccurate with the hope that others believe it is true or to create discord in society. 

We refer to these deliberate efforts to deceive and mislead using the speed, scale, and technologies of the open 
web as “disinformation”.

The entities that engage in disinformation have a diverse set of goals. Some are financially motivated, engaging 
in  disinformation  activities  for  the  purpose  of  turning  a  profit.  Others  are  politically  motivated,  engaging  in 
disinformation  to  foster  specific  viewpoints  among  a  population,  to  exert  influence  over  political  processes, 
or  for  the  sole  purpose  of  polarizing  and  fracturing  societies.  Others  engage  in  disinformation  for  their  own 
entertainment, which often involves bullying, and they are commonly referred to as “trolls”.

How Google Fights Disinformation


--- Page 4 ---

Levels of funding and sophistication vary across those entities, ranging from local mom-and-pop operations to 
well-funded and state-backed campaigns. In addition, propagators of disinformation sometimes end up working 
together, even unwittingly. For instance, politically motivated actors might emphasize a piece of disinformation 
that financially motivated groups might latch onto because it is getting enough attention to be a potential revenue 
source. Sometimes, a successful disinformation narrative is propagated by content creators who are acting in 
good faith and are unaware of the goals of its originators. 

This  complexity  makes  it  difficult  to  gain  a  full  picture  of  the  efforts  of  actors  who  engage  in  disinformation 
or  gauge  how  effective  their  efforts  may  be.  Furthermore,  because  it  can  be  difficult  to  determine  whether  a 
propagator of falsehoods online is acting in good faith, responses to disinformation run the risk of inadvertently 
harming legitimate expression.

Tackling disinformation in our products  
and services

We have an important responsibility to our users and to the societies in which we operate to curb the efforts 
of  those  who  aim  to  propagate  false  information  on  our  platforms.  At  the  same  time,  we  respect  our  users’ 
fundamental human rights (such as free expression) and we try to be clear and predictable in our efforts, letting 
users and content creators decide for themselves whether we are operating fairly. Of course, this is a delicate 
balance, as sharing too much of the granular details of how our algorithms and processes work would make it 
easier for bad actors to exploit them.

We face complex trade-offs and there is no ‘silver bullet’ that will resolve the issue of disinformation, because:

•  It can be extremely difficult (or even impossible) for humans or technology to determine the veracity of, or 

intent behind, a given piece of content, especially when it relates to current events. 

•  Reasonable  people  can  have  different  perspectives  on  the  right  balance  between  risks  of  harm  to  good 

faith, free expression, and the imperative to tackle disinformation. 

•  The solutions we build have to apply in ways that are understandable and predictable for users and content 
creators, and compatible with the kind of automation that is required when operating services on the scale 
of the web. We cannot create standards that require deep deliberation for every individual decision.

•  Disinformation manifests differently on different products and surfaces. Solutions that might be relevant in 
one context might be irrelevant or counter-productive in others. Our products cannot operate in the exact 
same way in that regard, and this is why they approach disinformation in their own specific ways.

Our  approach  to  tackling  disinformation  in  our  products  and  services  is  based  around  a  framework  of  three 
strategies: make quality count in our ranking systems, counteract malicious actors, and give users more context. 
We will outline them in this section, as well as the efforts we undertake beyond the scope of our products and 
services  to  team  up  with newsrooms  and  outside experts, and  to  get ahead of  future  risks. It  is worth noting 
that  these  strategies  are  also  used  to  address  misinformation  more  broadly,  which  pertains  to  the  overall 
trustworthiness of the information we provide users in our products.

In  later  sections  of  this  paper,  we  will  detail  how  these  strategies  are  implemented  and  expanded  for  Google 
Search, Google News, YouTube, and our advertising platforms. We adopt slightly different approaches in how we 
apply these principles to different products given how each service presents its own unique challenges.

1.  Make Quality Count

Our products are designed to sort through immense amounts of material and deliver content that best meets 
our users’ needs. This means delivering quality information and trustworthy commercial messages, especially 
in contexts that are prone to rumors and the propagation of false information (such as breaking news events).

While each product and service implements this differently, they share important principles that ensure our 
algorithms treat websites and content creators fairly and evenly: 

•  Information is organized by “ranking algorithms”. 

•  These  algorithms  are  geared  toward  ensuring  the  usefulness  of  our  services,  as  measured  by  user 
testing,  not  fostering  the  ideological  viewpoints  of  the  individuals  that  build  or  audit  them.  When  it 
comes  to  Google  Search,  you  can  find  a  detailed  explanation  of  how  those  algorithms  operate  at  
google.com/search/howsearchworks.

2.  Counteract Malicious Actors

Algorithms  cannot  determine  whether  a  piece  of  content  on  current  events  is  true  or  false,  nor  can  they 
assess the intent of its creator just by reading what’s on a page. However, there are clear cases of intent to 
manipulate or deceive users. For instance, a news website that alleges it contains “Reporting from Bordeaux, 
France” but whose account activity indicates that it is operated out of New Jersey in the U.S. is likely not being 
transparent with users about its operations or what they can trust it to know firsthand.

That’s why our policies across Google Search, Google News, YouTube, and our advertising products clearly 
outline behaviors that are prohibited – such as misrepresentation of one’s ownership or primary purpose on 
Google News and our advertising products, or impersonation of other channels or individuals on YouTube. 

Furthermore, since the early days of Google and YouTube, many content creators have tried to deceive our 
ranking systems to get more visibility – a set of practices we view as a form of ‘spam’ and that we’ve invested 
significant resources to address. 

This is relevant to tackling disinformation since many of those who engage in the creation or propagation of 
content for the purpose to deceive often deploy similar tactics in an effort to achieve more visibility. Over the 
course of the past two decades, we have invested in systems that can reduce ‘spammy’ behaviors at scale, 
and we complement those with human reviews.

3.  Give Users More Context

Easy  access  to  context  and  a  diverse  set  of  perspectives  are  key  to  providing  users  with  the  information 
they need to form their own views. Our products and services expose users to numerous links or videos in 
response to their searches, which maximizes the chances that users are exposed to diverse perspectives or 
viewpoints before deciding what to explore in depth.

Google  Search,  Google  News,  YouTube,  and  our  advertising  products  have  all  developed  additional 
mechanisms to provide more context and agency to users. Those include:

•  “Knowledge”  or  “Information”  Panels  in  Google  Search  and  YouTube,  providing  high-level  facts  about  a 

person or issue. 

•  Making it easier to discover the work of fact-checkers on Google Search or Google News, by using labels or 

snippets making it clear to users that a specific piece of content is a fact-checking article.

•  A “Full Coverage” function in Google News enabling users to access a non-personalized, in-depth view of a 

news cycle at the tap of a finger. 

•  “Breaking News” and “Top News” shelves, and “Developing News” information panels on YouTube, making 
sure that users are exposed to news content from authoritative sources when looking for information about 
ongoing news events. 

•  Information panels providing “Topical Context” and “Publisher Context” on YouTube, providing users with 
contextual information from trusted sources to help them be more informed consumers of content on the 
platform. These panels provide authoritative information on well-established historical and scientific topics 
that have often been subject to misinformation online and on the sources of news content, respectively. 

•  “Why  this  ad”  labels  enabling  users  to  understand  why  they’re  presented  with  a  specific  ad  and  how  to 
change  their  preferences  so  as  to  alter  the  personalization  of  the  ads  they  are  shown,  or  to  opt  out  of 
personalized ads altogether.

•  In-ad disclosures and transparency reports on election advertising, which are rolling out during elections 

in the US, Europe, and India as a starting point.

We also empower users to let us know when we’re getting it wrong by using feedback buttons across Search, 
YouTube, and our advertising products to flag content that might be violating our policies.

Teaming up with newsrooms and outside experts

Our  work  to  address  disinformation  is  not  limited  to  the  scope  of  our  products  and  services.  Indeed, 
other  organizations  play  a  fundamental  role  in  addressing  this  societal  challenge,  such  as  newsrooms,  
fact-checkers,  civil  society  organizations,  or  researchers.  While  we  all  address  different  aspects  of  this  issue, 
it is only by coming together that we can succeed. That is why we dedicate significant resources to supporting 
quality  journalism,  and  to  weaving  together  partnerships  with  many  other  organizations  in  this  space.

Supporting quality journalism

People come to Google looking for information they can trust and that information often comes from the reporting 
of journalists and news organizations around the world.

A thriving news ecosystem matters deeply to Google and directly impacts our efforts to combat disinformation. 
When quality journalism struggles to reach wide audiences, malicious actors have more room to propagate false 
information. 

Over the years, we’ve worked closely with the news industry to address these challenges and launched products 
and programs to help improve the business model of online journalism. These include the Accelerated Mobile 
Pages  Project1  to  improve  the  mobile  web,  YouTube  Player  for  Publishers2  to  simplify  video  distribution  and 
reduce costs, and many more.

In  March  2018,  we  launched  the  Google  News  Initiative  (GNI)3  to  help  journalism  thrive  in  the  digital  age.  
With a $300 million commitment over 3 years, the initiative aims to elevate and strengthen quality journalism, 
evolve  business  models  to  drive  sustainable  growth,  and  empower  news  organizations  through  technological 
innovation. $25M of this broader investment was earmarked as innovation grants for YouTube to support news 
organizations in building sustainable video operations.

One  of  the  programs  supported  by  the  Google  News  Initiative  is  Subscribe  with  Google4,  a  way  for  people  to 
easily  subscribe  to  various  news  outlets,  helping  publishers  engage  readers  across  Google  and  the  web. 
Another  is  News  Consumer  Insights,  a  new  dashboard  built  on  top  of  Google  Analytics,  which  will  help  news 
organizations  of  all  sizes  understand  and  segment  their  audiences  with  a  subscriptions  strategy  in  mind.  
More details on these projects and others can be found at g.co/newsinitiative.

Partnering with outside experts

Addressing disinformation is not something we can do on our own. The Google News Initiative also houses our 
products, partnerships, and programs dedicated to supporting news organizations in their efforts create quality 
reporting that displaces disinformation. This includes:

•  Helping  to  launch  the  First  Draft  Coalition  (https://firstdraftnews.org/),  a  nonprofit  that  convenes  news 
organizations and technology companies to tackle the challenges around combating disinformation online 
– especially in the run-up to elections. 

•  Participating in and providing financial support to the Trust Project (http://thetrustproject.org/), of which 
Google  is  a  founding  member  and  which  explores  how  journalism  can  signal  its  trustworthiness  online. 
The Trust Project has developed eight indicators of trust that publishers can use to better convey why their 
content should be seen as credible, with promising results for the publishers who have trialed them.

•  Partnering  with  Poynter’s  International  Fact-Checking  Network  (IFCN)5,  a  nonpartisan  organization 
gathering  fact-checking  organizations  from  the  United  States,  Germany,  Brazil,  Argentina,  South  Africa, 
India, and more. 

In  addition,  we  support  the  work  of  researchers  who  explore  the  issues  of  disinformation  and  trust  in  
journalism by funding research at organizations like First Draft, the Oxford University’s Reuters News Institute,  
Michigan University’s Quello Center for Telecommunication Management law, and more.

Finally, in March 2018, Google.org (Google’s philanthropic arm) launched a $10 million global initiative to support 
media literacy around the world in the footsteps of programs we have already supported in the UK, Brazil, Canada, 
Indonesia, and more. 

We will continue to explore more ways to partner with others on these issues, whether by building new products 
that might benefit the work of journalists and fact-checkers, supporting more independent initiatives that help 
curb disinformation, or developing self-regulatory practices to demonstrate our responsibility.

Getting ahead of future risks

Creators of disinformation will never stop trying to find new ways to deceive users. It is our responsibility to make 
sure we stay ahead of the game. Many of the product strategies and external partnerships mentioned earlier help 
us reach that goal. In addition, we dedicate specific focus to bolstering our defenses in the run-up to elections 
and invest in research and development efforts to stay ahead of new technologies or tactics that could be used 
by malicious actors, such as synthetic media (also known as ‘deep fakes’).

Protecting elections

Fair elections are critical to the health of democracy and we take our work to protect elections very seriously. Our 
products can help make sure users have access to accurate information about elections. For example, we often 
partner with election commissions, or other official sources, to make sure key information like the location of 
polling booths or the dates of the votes are easily available to users. 

We  also  work  to  protect  elections  from  attacks  and  interference,  including  focusing  on  combating  political 
influence operations, improving account and website security, and increasing transparency.

To prevent political influence operations, working with our partners at Jigsaw, we have multiple internal teams 
that identify malicious actors wherever they originate, disables their accounts, and shares threat information with 
other companies and law enforcement officials. We routinely provide public updates about these operations.7

There  is  more  we  can  do  beyond  protecting  our  own  platforms.  Over  the  past  several  years,  we  have  taken 
steps  to  help  protect  accounts,  campaigns,  candidates,  and  officials  against  digital  attacks.  Our  Protect  Your 
Election project8 offers a suite of extra security to protect against malicious or insecure apps and guards against 
phishing. To protect election and campaign websites, we also offer Project Shield9, which can mitigate the risk of 
Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. 

In the run-up to elections, we provide free training to ensure that campaign professionals and political parties are 
up-to-speed on the means to protect themselves from attack. For instance, in 2018, we trained more than 1,000 
campaign professionals and the eight major U.S. Republican and Democratic committees on email and campaign 
website security. 

Furthermore,  as  a  part  of  our  security  efforts,  for  the  past  eight  years,  we  have  displayed  warnings  to  Gmail 
users who are at risk of phishing by potentially state-sponsored actors (even though, in most cases, the specific 
phishing attempt never reaches the user’s inbox).

Finally, in order to help understand the context for the election-related ads they see online, we require additional 
verification for advertisers who wish to purchase political ads in the United States, provide transparency about the 
advertiser to the user, and have established an online transparency report and creative repository on US federal 
elections.10

We look forward to expanding these tools, trainings, and strategies to more elections in 2019, starting with efforts 
focused on two of the world’s largest upcoming elections, which are in Europe11 and in India.12

Expecting the unexpected 

Creators of disinformation are constantly exploring new ways to bypass the defenses set by online services in an 
effort to spread their messages to a wider audience.

To  stay  ahead  of  the  curve,  we  continuously  invest  resources  to  stay  abreast  of  the  next  tools,  tactics,  or 
technologies that creators of disinformation may attempt to use. We convene with experts all around the world 
to understand what concerns them. We also invest in research, product, and policy developments to anticipate 
threat vectors that we might not be equipped to tackle at this point. 

One example is the rise of new forms of AI-generated, photo-realistic, synthetic audio or video content known as 
“synthetic media” (often referred to as “deep fakes”). While this technology has useful applications (for instance, 
by opening new possibilities to those affected by speech or reading impairments, or new creative grounds for 
artists and movie studios around the world), it raises concerns when used in disinformation campaigns and for 
other malicious purposes.

The field of synthetic media is fast-moving and it is hard to predict what might happen in the near future. To help 
prepare for this issue, Google and YouTube are investing in research to understand how AI might help detect such 
synthetic content as it emerges, working with leading experts in this field from around the world.

Finally,  because  no  detector  can  be  perfect,  we  are  engaging  with  civil  society,  academia,  newsrooms,  and 
governments to share our best understanding of this challenge and work together on what other steps societies 
can  take  to  improve  their  preparedness.  This  includes  exploring  ways  to  help  others  come  up  with  their  own 
detection tools. One example may involve releasing datasets of synthesized content that others can use to train 
AI-based detectors.13

Google Search,  
Google News &amp; Disinformation 
Background

Google  created  its  search  engine  in  1998,  with  a  mission  to  organize  the  world’s  information  and  make  it 
universally accessible and useful. At the time, the web consisted of just 25 million pages. 

Today, we index hundreds of billions of pages – more information than all the libraries in the world could hold and 
serve people all over the world. Search is offered in more than 150 languages and over 190 countries. 

We continue to improve on Search every day. In 2017 alone, Google conducted more than 200,000 experiments 
that resulted in about 2,400 changes to Search. Each of those changes is tested to make sure it aligns with our 
publicly available Search Quality Rater Guidelines,14 which define the goals of our ranking systems and guide the 
external evaluators who provide ongoing assessments of our algorithms.

Over the past 20 years, we have grappled with the tension between the open access to information and expression 
that  the  web  enables  and  the  need  to  ensure  trust  in  authoritative  information.  Our  work  on  disinformation 
continues to be informed by these dual goals, as we attempt to strike the right balance in tackling this challenge. 

Different  types  of  content  may  require  different  approaches  to  ranking  and  presentation  in  order  to  meet  our 
users’  needs.  Google  News  arose  from  such  a  realization  and  was  one  of  the  first  products  Google  launched 
beyond Search. Former Googler Krishna Bharat observed that when people searched for news after the tragic 
9/11 attacks in New York, Google responded with old news stories about New York rather than the latest events. 
He set about to fix that, and on September 22, 2002, Google News was born.

Over  time,  Google  News  has  improved,  including  how  we  present  content  related  to  current  events  in  Google 
Search. In 2018, we launched a reimagined Google News that uses a new set of AI techniques to take a constant 
flow of information as it hits the web, analyze it in real-time, and organize it around breaking news events.15

in  our  mission  and 

Through  all  of  this,  we’ve  remained 
grounded 
the 
importance  of  providing  greater  access 
to  information,  helping  users  navigate 
the  open  web.  We  continue  to  believe 
that  this  access 
is  fundamental  to 
helping people make sense of the world 
around  them,  exercise  their  own  critical 
thinking,  and  make  informed  decisions 
as citizens.

Tackling disinformation on Google Search  
&amp; Google News

Since  Google’s  early  days,  malicious  actors  have  attempted  to  harm  or  deceive  Search  users  through  a  wide 
range  of  actions,  including  tricking  our  systems  in  order  to  promote  their  own  content  (via  a  set  of  practices 
we refer to as “spam”), propagating malware, and engaging in illegal acts online. The creators and purveyors of 
disinformation employ many of the same tactics.

Disinformation  poses  a  unique  challenge.  Google  is  not  in  a  situation  to  assess  objectively,  and  at  scale,  the 
veracity of a piece of content or the intent of its creators. Further, a considerable percentage of content contains 
information that cannot be objectively verified as fact. This is because it either lacks necessary context, because 
it is delivered through an ideological lens others may disagree with, or because it is constructed from contested 
datapoints. 

Disinformation  also  raises  broader  concerns  of  harm.  In  the  worst  cases,  the  impacts  of  disinformation 
campaigns can affect an entire society. The stakes of accurately identifying disinformation are higher because 
disinformation often concerns issues at the core of political society for which the free exchange of ideas and 
information among genuine voices is of the greatest importance.

To deal with this issue, Google Search and Google News take a pragmatic approach that reinforces the product 
strategies we have highlighted in the opening section of this paper:

•  Make Quality Count

•  We use ranking algorithms to elevate authoritative, high-quality information in our products.

•  We  take  additional  steps  to  improve  the  quality  of  our  results  for  contexts  and  topics  that  our  users 

expect us to handle with particular care.

•  Counteract Malicious Actors

•  We  look  for  and  take  action  against  attempts  to  deceive  our  ranking  systems  or  circumvent  

our policies.

•  Give Users More Context

•  We provide users with tools to access the context and diversity of perspectives they need to form their 

own views.

Do Google News and Google Search combat disinformation  
in the same ways? 

Google News’ focus – coverage of current events – is narrower than that of Google Search. However, their 
goals are closely related. Both products present users with trustworthy results that meet their information 
needs about the issues they care about. 

For that reason, both products have a lot in common when it comes to the way they operate For instance, 
ranking in Google News is built on the basis of Google Search ranking and they share the same defenses 
against “spam” (attempts at gaming our ranking systems).

In addition, both products share some fundamental principles: 

•  They use algorithms, not humans, to determine the ranking of the content they show to users No individual 
at Google ever makes determinations about the position of an individual webpage link on a Google Search 
or Google News results page. 

•  Our algorithms are geared toward ensuring the usefulness of our services, as measured by user testing, 

not fostering the ideological viewpoints of the individuals who build or audit them. 

•  The  systems  do  not  make  subjective  determinations  about  the  truthfulness  of  webpages,  but  rather 
focus  on  measurable  signals  that  correlate  with  how  users  and  other  websites  value  the  expertise, 
trustworthiness, or authoritativeness of a webpage on the topics it covers. 

That said, because Google News’ purposes are explicitly narrower than those of Google Search and solely 
focused on coverage of current events, it builds its own ranking systems and content policies on top of 
those of Google Search.

When it comes to ranking, this means that the systems we use in Google News and in places that are 
focused  on  News  in  Google  Search  (e.g.  our  “Top  Stories”  Carousel  or  our  “News” Tab)  make  special 
efforts  to  understand  things  like  the  prominence  of  a  news  story  in  the  media  landscape  of  the  day, 
which articles most relate to that story, or which sources are most trusted for specific news topics. It 
also means that Google News might give additional importance toward factors that indicate a webpage’s 
newsworthiness  or  journalistic  value  for  users,  such  as  its  freshness  or  (for  specific  tabs  within   
Google News).

When it comes to content policies: 

•  Google Search aims to make information from the web available to all our users. That’s why we do not 
remove  content  from  results  in  Google  Search,  except  in  very  limited  circumstances.  These  include 
legal  removals,  violations  of  our  webmaster  guidelines,  or  a  request  from  the  webmaster  responsible  
for the page. 

•  Google Search contains some features that are distinct from its general results, such as Autocomplete. 
For  features  where  Google  specifically  promotes  or  highlights  content,  we  may  remove  content  that 
violates their specific policies.16

•  Because  Google  News  does  not  attempt  to  be  a  comprehensive  reflection  of  the  web,  but  instead  to 
focus  on  journalistic  accounts  of  current  events,  it  has  more  restrictive  content  policies  than  Google 
Search. Google News explicitly prohibits content that incites, promotes, or glorifies violence, harassment, 
or dangerous activities. Similarly, Google News does not allow sites or accounts that impersonate any 
person or organization, that misrepresent or conceal their ownership or primary purpose, or that engage 
in coordinated activity to mislead users.17

With those nuances in mind, it is still safe to think of Google News and Google Search’s approaches to 
disinformation  and  misinformation  are  mostly  similar,  and  the  content  of  the  following  sections  apply 
to both products. Where there is a difference, it will be outlined explicitly in the body of the text or in a 
dedicated callout box.

We use ranking algorithms to elevate high-quality  
information in our products

Ranking  algorithms  are  an  important  tool  in  our  fight  against  disinformation.  Ranking  elevates  the  relevant 
information that our algorithms determine is the most authoritative and trustworthy above information that may 
be less reliable. These assessments may vary for each webpage on a website and are directly related to our users’ 
searches. For instance, a national news outlet’s articles might be deemed authoritative in response to searches 
relating to current events, but less reliable for searches related to gardening.

For most searches that could potentially surface misleading information, there is high-quality information that 
our ranking algorithms can detect and elevate. When we succeed in surfacing high-quality results, lower quality 
or outright malicious results (such as disinformation or otherwise deceptive pages) are relegated to less visible 
positions in Search or News, letting users begin their journey by browsing more reliable sources.

Our ranking system does not identify the intent or factual accuracy of any given piece of content. However, it is 
specifically designed to identify sites with high indicia of expertise, authority, and trustworthiness.

How do Google’s algorithms assess expertise, authority,  
and trustworthiness?

•  Google’s algorithms identify signals about pages that correlate with trustworthiness and authoritativeness. 
The  best  known  of  these  signals  is  PageRank,  which  uses  links  on  the  web  to  understand 
authoritativeness.

•  We are constantly evolving these algorithms to improve results – not least because the web itself keeps 
changing.  For  instance,  in  2017  alone,  we  ran  over  200,000  experiments  with  trained  external  Search 
Evaluators and live user tests, resulting in more than 2,400 updates to Google Search algorithms.

•  To perform these evaluations, we work with Search Quality Evaluators who help us measure the quality 
of Search results on an ongoing basis. Evaluators assess whether a website provides users who click on 
it with the content they were looking for, and they evaluate the quality of results based on the expertise, 
authoritativeness, and trustworthiness of the content.

•  The resulting ratings do not affect the ranking of any individual website, but they do help us benchmark 
the quality of our results, which in turn allows us to build algorithms that globally recognize results that 
meet high-quality criteria. To ensure a consistent approach, our evaluators use the Search Quality Rater 
Guidelines (publicly available online)18 which provide guidance and examples for appropriate ratings. To 
ensure  the  consistency  of  the  rating  program,  Search  Quality  evaluators  must  pass  a  comprehensive 
exam and are audited on a regular basis.

•  These  evaluators  also  perform  evaluations  of  each  improvement  to  Search  we  roll  out:  in  side-by-side 
experiments,  we  show  evaluators  two  different  sets  of  Search  results,  one  with  the  proposed  change 
already implemented and one without. We ask them which results they prefer and why. This feedback is 
central to our launch decisions.

We take additional steps to improve the trustworthiness of our results for 
contexts and topics that our users expect us to handle with particular care. 

Our  Search  Quality  Raters  Guidelines  acknowledge  that  some  types  of  pages  could  potentially  impact  the 
future  happiness,  health,  financial  stability,  or  safety  of  users.  We  call  those  “Your  Money  or  Your  Life”  pages 
or  YMYL.  We  introduced  the  YMYL  category  in  2014. They  include  financial  transaction  or  information  pages, 
medical  and  legal  information  pages,  as  well  as  news  articles,  and  public  and/or  official  information  pages 
that are important for having an informed citizenry. This last category can comprise anything from information 
about local, state, or national government processes or policies, news about important topics in a given country,  
or disaster response services. 

For  these  “YMYL”  pages,  we  assume  that 
users  expect  us  to  operate  with  our  strictest 
standards  of 
trustworthiness  and  safety.  
As  such,  where  our  algorithms  detect  that 
a  user’s  query  relates  to  a  “YMYL”  topic,  we 
will  give  more  weight  in  our  ranking  systems 
like  our  understanding  of  the 
to  factors 
authoritativeness, expertise, or trustworthiness 
of the pages we present in response.

Our Search Quality Raters Guidelines

Similarly,  we  direct  our  Google  Search 
evaluators  to  be  more  demanding  in  their 
assessment of the quality and trustworthiness 
of  these  page  than  they  would  otherwise. 
in  2016,  we  added  additional 
Specifically, 
guidance to our Search Quality Rater Guidelines advising evaluators to give lower quality ratings to informational 
pages that contain demonstrably inaccurate content or debunked conspiracy theories. While their ratings don’t 
determine individual page rankings, they are used to help us gather data on the quality of our results and identify 
areas where we need to improve. This data from Search Evaluators also plays a significant role in determining 
which changes we roll out to our ranking systems. 

Beyond specific types of content that are more sensitive to users, we realize that some contexts are more prone 
to the propagation of disinformation than others. For instance, breaking news events, and the heightened level 
of interest that they elicit, are magnets for bad behavior by malicious players. Speculation can outrun facts as 
legitimate news outlets on the ground are still investigating. At the same time, malicious actors are publishing 
content on forums and social media with the intent to mislead and capture people’s attention as they rush to 
find trusted information. To reduce the visibility of this type of content, we have designed our systems to prefer 
authority over factors like recency or exact word matches while a crisis is developing.

In  addition,  we  are  particularly  attentive  to  the  integrity  of  our  systems  in  the  run-up  to  significant  societal 
moments in the countries where we operate, such as elections.19

We actively look for and take action against attempts to deceive  
our ranking systems or circumvent our policies.

Google  is  designed  to  help  users  easily  discover  and  access  the  webpages  that  contain  the  information  they 
are looking for. Our goals are aligned with those of site owners who publish high-quality content online because 
they want it to be discovered by users who might be interested. That’s why we provide extensive tools and tips 

13


--- Page 15 ---

to  help  webmasters  and  developers 
manage 
their  Search  presence  and 
succeed  in  having  their  content,  sites, 
and  apps  found.  We  provide  interactive 
websites, videos, starter guides, frequent 
blog  posts,  user  forums,  and  live  expert 
support  to 
inform  webmasters.  Our 
publicly  available  webmaster  guidelines 
complement these resources by outlining 
some  of  the  tips  and  behaviors  that  we 
recommend webmasters adopt to make 
it  easiest  for  our  systems  to  crawl  and 
index their websites.20

Google Webmaster Guidelines

Not all site owners act in good faith. Since the early days of Google, many have attempted to manipulate their way 
to the top of Search results through deceptive or manipulative behavior, using any insights into the functioning 
of  our  systems  they  can  get  to  try  to  circumvent  them. The  earliest  example  of  such  attempts  dates  back  to 
1999, when Google’s founders published a seminal paper on PageRank, a key innovation in Google’s algorithm.21  
The paper described how our algorithms use links between websites as an indicator of authority. Once that paper 
was published, spammers tried to game Google by paying each other for links. 

These manipulative behaviors aim to elevate websites to users not because they are the best response to a query, 
but because a webmaster has deceived our systems. As such, they are considered “spam” and run afoul of our 
core mission. Our webmaster guidelines clearly spell out actions that are prohibited and state that we will take 
action against websites engaging in such behaviors. 

While  not  all  spammers  engage  in  disinformation,  many  of  the  malicious  actors  who  try  to  distribute 
disinformation (at all levels of sophistication or funding) engage in some form  of spam. The tactics they use  
are  similar  to  those  of  other  spammers.  Therefore,  our  work  against  spam  goes  hand-in-hand  with  our  work 
against disinformation. 

Our algorithms can detect the majority of spam and demote or remove it automatically. The remaining spam is 
tackled manually by our spam removal team, which reviews pages (often based on user feedback) and flags them 
if they violate the Webmaster Guidelines. In 2017, we took action on 90,000 user reports of search spam and 
algorithmically detected many more times that number.

As our tactics improve and evolve, so does spam. One of the trends we observed in 2017 was an increase in 
website hacking, both for spamming search ranking and for spreading malware. We focused on reducing this 
threat  and  were  able  to  detect  and  remove  from  Search  results  more  than  80  percent  of  these  sites  over  the 
following year. 

We continue to be vigilant regarding techniques used by spammers and remain conscientious of what we share 
about the ways our ranking systems work so as not to create vulnerabilities they can exploit.

Google News policies against deceptive content

In addition to other efforts to fight spam, Google News’ content policies prohibit: 

•  Sites or accounts that impersonate any person or organization;

•  Sites that misrepresent or conceal their ownership or primary purpose; 

•  Sites or accounts that engage in coordinated activity to mislead users – including, but not limited to, sites 
or accounts that misrepresent or conceal their country of origin or that direct content at users in another 
country under false pretenses.

In addition to algorithmic signals that might indicate such behavior, where there is an indication that a 
publisher may be violating our policies, such as through a user report or suspicious account activity, our 
Trust and Safety team will investigate and, where appropriate, take action against that site and related 
sites that can be confirmed to be operating in concert.

We provide users with the context and diversity of perspectives  
they need to form their own views.

From  the  very  beginning  of  Google  Search,  the  very  nature  of  Google  Search  results  pages  has  ensured  that 
when looking for information on news or public interest topics they care about, users are presented with links to 
multiple websites and perspectives. 

This  remains  true  today.  When  users  search  for  news  on 
links. 
Google,  they  are  always  presented  with  multiple 
In  many  cases,  they  are  also  presented  with  additional 
elements  that  help  them  get  more  context  about  their 
search.  For  instance,  “Knowledge  Panels”  might  show  in 
Search  results  to  provide  context  and  basic  information 
about  people,  places,  or  things  that  Google  knows  about. 
Fact-check  tags  or  snippets  might  show  below 
links  
in  Google  Search  and  Google  News,  outlining  that  a  specific 
piece of content purports to fact-check a claim made by a third 
party.22 Or we might call out related searches or questions that 
users tend to ask about the topic of a search query. 

Fact-Check on Google Search

Local Coverage &amp; Timeline in Google News

In  Google  News,  additional  cues  may  help  users  pick  up  on  points  of  context  that  are  particularly  relevant  to 
News stories, such as “Opinion” or “User-Generated Content” tags under articles that news publishers want to 
signal as such; or algorithmically generated story timelines that let users explore at-a-glance the milestones of  
a news story over the weeks or months that led to the day’s events. 

Does Google personalize the content that shows in Google Search and 
Google News so that users only see news consistent with their views, 
sometimes known as “filter bubbles”?

We try to make sure that our users continue to have access to a diversity of websites and perspectives. 
Google Search and Google News take different approaches toward that goal.

15


--- Page 17 ---

Google Search: contrary to popular belief, there is very little personalization in Search based on users’ 
inferred interests or Search history before their current session. It doesn’t take place often and generally 
doesn’t significantly change Search results from one person to another. Most differences that users see 
between their Search results and those of another user typing the same Search query are better explained 
by other factors such as a user’s location, the language used in the search, the distribution of Search index 
updates throughout our data centers, and more.23 Furthermore, the Top Stories carousel that often shows 
in Search results in response to news-seeking searches is never personalized. 

Google News: To meet the needs of users who seek information on topics they care about, Google News 
aims to strike a balance between providing access to the same content and perspectives as other users 
and presenting content that relates to news topics one cares about. To do this, Google News offers three 
interconnected ways to discover information: 

•  ‘Headlines’  and  ‘Top  Stories’:  To  help  users  stay  on  top  of  the  top  trending  news  in  their  country,  the 
“Headlines” and “Top Stories” tabs shows the major stories and issues that news sources are covering at 
any point in time and shows them to everyone in a non-personalized manner. 

•  For You: To help users stay on top of the news that matter to them, the “For You” tab lets them specify the 
topics, publications, and locations they are interested in so they can see the news that relates to those 
selections. Additionally, and depending on their permission settings, the “For You” tab may show them 
news they may be interested in in light of their past activity on Google products. 

•  Full Coverage: To help users access context and diverse perspectives about the news stories they read, the 
“Full Coverage” feature in Google News lets users explore articles and videos from a variety of publishers 
related to an article or news story of their choice. The “Full Coverage” feature is not personalized and is 
accessible in one click or tap from most articles in the “For You” and “Headlines” tabs. 

Importantly, for both services, we never personalize content based on signals relating to point of view 
on  issues  and/or  political  leanings  –  our  systems  do  not  collect  such  signals,  nor  do  they  have  an 
understanding of political ideologies. 

We constantly improve our algorithms, policies, and partnerships,  
and are open about issues we have yet to address. 

Because the malicious actors who propagate disinformation have the incentive to keep doing so, they continue to 
probe for new ways to game our systems, and it is incumbent on us to stay ahead of this technological arms race. 
A compounding factor in that challenge is that our systems are constantly confronted with searches they have 
never seen before. Every day, 15% of the queries that our users type in the Google Search bar are new.

For  these  reasons,  we  regularly  evolve  our  ranking  algorithms,  our  content  policies,  and  the  partnerships  
we enter into as part of our efforts to curb disinformation. 

We are aware that many issues remain unsolved at this point. For example, a known strategy of propagators of 
disinformation is to publish a lot of content targeted on “data voids”, a term popularized by the U.S. based think 
tank Data and Society to describe Search queries where little high-quality content exists on the web for Google to 
display due to the fact that few trustworthy organizations cover them.24 This often applies, for instance, to niche 
conspiracy theories, which most serious newsrooms or academic organizations won’t make the effort to debunk. 
As a result, when users enter Search terms that specifically refer to these theories, ranking algorithms can only 
elevate links to the content that is actually available on the open web – potentially including disinformation. 

We  are  actively  exploring  ways  to  address  this  issue,  and  others,  and  welcome  the  thoughts  and  feedback  
of researchers, policymakers, civil society, and journalists around the world.

YouTube &amp; 
Disinformation
Background

YouTube  started  in  2005  as  a  video-sharing  website  and  quickly  evolved  into  one  of  the  world’s  most  vibrant 
online communities. Thousands, then millions, then billions of people connected through content that educated, 
excited, or inspired them. YouTube is one of the world’s largest exporters of online cultural and learning content 
and is a significant driver of economic activity, providing many of its creators with the ability to make a livelihood 
by using its services. 

Disinformation is not unique to YouTube. It is a global problem afflicting many platforms and publishers. When a 
platform fosters openness, as we do at YouTube, there’s a risk that unreliable information will be presented. While 
disinformation has been a problem as long as there’s been news to report, the Internet has made it possible for 
disinformation to spread further and faster than ever before. We take our responsibility to combat disinformation 
in this domain seriously. To be effective at our size, we invest in a combination of technological solutions with a 
large and growing base of human talent. Technology provides scale and speed, while human talent provides the 
contextual knowledge needed to fine-tune and improve our systems every step of the way.

YouTube  has  developed  a  comprehensive  approach  to  tackling  controversial  content  on  our  platform.  
This approach is guided by three principles:

1.  Keep content on the platform unless it is in violation of our Community Guidelines

2.  Set a high bar for recommendations

3.  Monetization is a privilege

From  these  principles,  we  create  robust  systems  to  responsibly  manage  all  types  of  controversial  content, 
including disinformation. 

Given  how  broad  the  spectrum  of  disinformation  is,  we  implement  the  three  product  strategies  mentioned 
in  our  opening  section  in  ways  that  are  relevant  to  YouTube’s  specific  products,  community,  and  challenges: 

•  Make Quality Count

•  We deploy effective product and ranking systems that demote low-quality disinformation and elevate 

more authoritative content

•  Counteract Malicious Actors 

•  We rigorously develop and enforce our content policies

•  We protect the integrity of information tied to elections through effective ranking algorithms, and tough 

policies against users that misrepresent themselves or who engage in other deceptive practices 

•  We remove monetary incentives through heightened standards for accounts that seek to utilize any of 

YouTube’s monetization products

•  Give Users Context

•  We provide context to users via information panels on YouTube 

17

We take our responsibilities as a platform seriously. We believe a responsible YouTube will continue to embrace 
the democratization of access to information while providing a reliable and trustworthy service to our users.

Tackling disinformation on YouTube

Given  the  spectrum  of  content  and  intent,  it  is  necessary  to  have  a  nuanced  approach  that  strikes  the  right 
balance between managing our users’ expectations to express themselves freely on the platform with the need to 
preserve the health of the broader community of the creator, user, and advertiser ecosystem. Let’s take a closer 
look at the three guiding principles on which we base our approach for YouTube:

1.  Keep content on the platform unless it is in violation  

of our Community Guidelines

YouTube’s  Community  Guidelines25  prohibit  certain  categories  of  material,  including  sexually  explicit  content, 
spam, hate speech, harassment and incitement to violence. We aim to balance free expression with preventing 
harmful  content in order to maintain a vibrant community.  Striking this balance is never easy, especially for  a 
global platform. YouTube has always had Community Guidelines, but we revise them as user behavior changes 
and as the world evolves. 

YouTube also maintains a more detailed and living set of enforcement guidelines that provide internal guidance on 
the enforcement of the public Community Guidelines. These enforcement guidelines are extensive and dynamic 
to ensure that the policies apply to changing trends and new patterns of controversial content online. YouTube 
does not typically disclose these updates to the public because doing so would make it easier for unscrupulous 
users to evade detection. 

To help formulate rules that are consistent, unbiased, well-informed, and broad enough to apply to a wide scope 
of  content,  YouTube  often  relies  on  external  subject  matter  experts  and  NGOs  to  consult  on  various  issues. 
YouTube  has  also  worked  with  independent  experts  as  a  member  of  the  Global  Network  Initiative  (GNI),26  to 
establish  key  principles  to  guide  content  review  efforts  and  systems,  including  notifying  users  if  a  video  is 
removed and allowing for appeals. To honor YouTube’s commitment to human rights, we also make exceptions 
to the Community Guidelines for material that is educational, documentary, scientific, and/or artistic.

Consistent enforcement
With  hundreds  of  hours  of  new  content  uploaded  to  YouTube  every  minute,  clear  policies  and  enforcement 
guidelines are only part of what matters. To maintain a site where abuse is minimized, the systems used to curtail 
abuse must scale. YouTube has always relied on a mix of humans and technology to enforce its guidelines and 
will continue to do so. 

YouTube has thousands of reviewers who operate 24/7 to address content that may violate our policies and the 
team  is  constantly  expanding  to  meet  evolving  enforcement  needs.  Our  review  teams  are  diverse  and  global. 
Linguistic  and  cultural  knowledge  is  needed  to  interpret  the  context  of  a  flagged  video  and  decide  whether  it 
violates our guidelines. Reviewers go through a comprehensive training program to ensure that they have a full 
understanding  of  YouTube’s  Community  Guidelines.  We  use  frequent  tests  as  part  of  the  training  process  to 
ensure quality and knowledge retention. Human reviewers are essential to evaluating context and to ensuring that 
educational, documentary, scientific, and artistic content is protected.

YouTube flagging and review decisions continuously improves our systems

Application to disinformation
There are several policies in the Community Guidelines that are directly applicable in some form to disinformation. 
These include policies against spam, deceptive practices, scams,28 impersonation,29 hate,30 and harassment.31

The  policy  against  spam,  deceptive  practices,  and  scams  prohibits  posting  large  amounts  of  untargeted, 
unwanted,  or  repetitive  content  in  videos,  comments,  private  messages,  especially  if  the  main  purpose  of  the 
content is to drive people off to another site. Similarly, activity that seeks to artificially increase the number of 
views, likes, dislikes, comments, or other metrics either through the use of automated systems or by serving up 
videos to unsuspecting viewers is against our terms. Additionally, content that exists solely to incentivize viewers 
for engagement (views, likes, comments, etc.), or by coordinating at scale with other users to drive up views for 
the primary purpose of interfering with our systems, is prohibited. 

One of the abuses this policy covers is content that deliberately seeks to spread disinformation that could suppress 
voting or otherwise interfere with democratic or civic processes. For example, demonstrably false content that 
claims one demographic votes on one day while another votes on a separate day would be in violation of our 
policies. 

Another applicable policy regards impersonation. Accounts seeking to spread disinformation by misrepresenting 
who they are via impersonation are clearly against our policies and the account will be removed. For example, if 
a user copies a channel’s profile, background, or text, and writes comments to make it look like somebody else’s 
channel posted the comments, we remove the channel. Impersonation can also occur if a user creates a channel 
or video using another individual’s real name, image, or other personal information to deceive people into thinking 
they are someone else on YouTube. 

YouTube has clear policies against hate and harassment. Hate speech refers to content that promotes violence 
against, or has the primary purpose of inciting hatred against, individuals or groups based on certain attributes, 
such as race or ethnic origin, religion, disability, gender, age, veteran status, or sexual orientation/gender identity. 
Harassment  may  include  abusive  videos,  comments,  messages,  revealing  someone’s  personal  information, 
unwanted sexualization, or incitement to harass other users or creators. Users that spread disinformation that 
runs afoul of either our hate or harassment policies will be removed and further appropriate action taken.

2.  Set a high bar for recommendations

Our primary objective when it comes to  our  search  and discovery systems is to  help people find content that 
they  will  enjoy  watching,  whether  through  their  Homepage,  Watch  Next,  or  Search  results.  We  aim  to  provide 
content that lets users dive into topics they care about, broaden their perspective, and connect them to the current 
zeitgeist. When a user is seeking content with high intent – subscribing to a channel or searching for the video –  
it  is  our  responsibility  to  help  users  find  and  watch  the  video.  On  the  other  hand,  in  the  absence  of  strong  or 
specific intent for a particular video, we believe it is our responsibility to not proactively recommend content that 
may be deemed low quality.

How our approach to recommendations has evolved
When YouTube’s recommendation systems first launched, it sought to optimize for content that got users to click. 
We noticed that this system incentivized creators to publish misleading and sensationalist clickbait, and users 
would click on the video but very quickly realize the content was not something they liked. The system was failing 
to meet our user-centric goals. 

To  provide  a  better  service  for  our  users,  we  began  to  look  at  the  amount  of  time  a  video  was  watched,  and 
whether it was watched to completion, rather than just whether it was clicked. Additionally, we began to demote 
clickbait. We realized that watchtime was a better signal to determine whether the content we were surfacing to 
users was connecting them to engaging content they’d enjoy watching. But we learned that just because a user 
might be watching content longer does not mean that they are having a positive experience. So we introduced 
surveys to ask users if they were satisfied with particular recommendations. With this direct feedback, we started 
fine-tuning and improving these systems based on this high-fidelity notion of satisfaction. 

The efforts to improve YouTube’s recommendation systems did not end there. We set out to prevent our systems 
from serving up content that could misinform users in a harmful way, particularly in domains that rely on veracity, 
such as science, medicine, news, or historical events. 

To that end, we introduced a higher bar for videos that are promoted through the YouTube homepage or that are 
surfaced to users through the “watch next” recommendations. Just because content is available on the site, it 
does not mean that it will display as prominently throughout the recommendation engine. 

As  has  been  mentioned  previously,  our  business  depends  on  the  trust  users  place  in  our  services  to  provide 
reliable, high-quality information. The primary goal of our recommendation systems today is to create a trusted 
and positive experience for our users. Ensuring these recommendation systems less frequently provide fringe or 
low-quality disinformation content is a top priority for the company. The YouTube company-wide goal is framed 
not just as “Growth”, but as “Responsible Growth”.

Beyond  removal  of  content  that  violates  our  community  guidelines,  our  teams  have  three  explicit  tactics  
to support responsible content consumption. They are: 

•  Where possible and relevant, elevate authoritative content from trusted sources. In areas such as music 
or entertainment, relevance, newness, or popularity might be better signals to tilt our systems to achieve 
the user’s desired intent and connect them to quality content they’d enjoy. But as we describe in our Search 
section, in verticals where veracity and credibility are key, including news, politics, medical, and scientific 
domains,  we  work  hard  to  ensure  our  search  and  recommendation  systems  provide  content  from  more 
authoritative sources.

•  Provide users with more context (often text-based information) to make them more informed users on 
the content they consume. On certain types of content, including content produced by organizations that 
receive state or public funding or topical content that tends to be accompanied by disinformation online, 
we have started to provide information panels that contain additional contextual information and links to 
authoritative third-party sites so that our users can make educated decisions about the content they watch 
on our platform.

•  Reduce  recommendations  of  low-quality  content.  We  aim  to  design  a  system  that  recommends 
quality  content  while  less  frequently  recommending  content  that  may  be  close  to  the  line  created  by 
our  Community  Guidelines,  content  that  could  misinform  users  in  harmful  ways,  or  low-quality  content 
that  may  result  in  a  poor  experience  for  our  users,  like  clickbait.  For  example,  content  that  claims  that 
the  Earth  is  flat  or  promises  a  “miracle  cure”  for  a  serious  disease  might  not  necessarily  violate  our 
Community  Guidelines,  but  we  don’t  want  to  proactively  recommend  it  to  users.  Our  incentives  are  to  
get this right for our users, so we use everyday people as evaluators to provide input on what constitutes 
disinformation or borderline content under our policies, which in turn informs our ranking systems.

Case Study: Applying Our Principles to YouTube News &amp; Politics

Disinformation in news and politics is a priority given its importance to society and the outsized impact 
disinformation can have during fast-moving news events. Although news content only generates a small 
fraction of overall YouTube watchtime, it’s a specific use case that is especially important to us. 

In July 2018, YouTube announced product and partnership tactics that directly apply our guiding content 
management principles to news.32

The  first  solution  included  making  authoritative  sources  readily  available.  To  help  meet  this  goal,  we 
created a system to elevate authoritative sources for people coming to YouTube for news and politics. 
For example, if a user is watching content from  a trusted news source, the “watch next” panel should 
similarly display content from other trusted news sources. Assumed within this principle is the demotion 
of disinformation content that we outlined earlier. 

The team has also built and launched two cornerstone products – the Top News shelf and the Breaking 
News shelf – to prominently display authoritative political news information. The Top News shelf triggers 
in response to search queries that have political news-seeking intent, and provides content from verified 
news channels. These systems rely on a variety of signals that are derived from Google News and from 
our internal systems when a user might be seeking information on a given topic.

21


--- Page 23 ---

The Breaking News shelf triggers on 
the YouTube homepage automatically 
when there is a significant news event 
happening in a specific country. 

Similar  to  the  Top  News  shelf,  only 
content  from  authoritative  sources 
is  eligible  to  be  displayed  in  the 
Breaking News shelf. 

More  recently,  YouTube  has  been 
developing  products 
that  directly 
address a core vulnerability involving 
the  spread  of  disinformation  in  the 
immediate  aftermath  of  a  breaking 
news  event.  After  a  breaking 
news  event,  it  takes  some  time  for 
journalists  to  create  authoritative 
fact-based video content and upload 
it  to  YouTube,  while  unscrupulous 
uploaders  can  more  quickly  upload 
bizarre conspiracy theories.

Top News Shelf on YouTube Search

Breaking News Shelf on YouTube Home

In  these  events,  YouTube’s  systems  historically  delivered  the  most 
relevant content that matched the typed query, and without appropriate 
guardrails would display content from these users seeking to exploit 
this vulnerability.

The  first  step  toward  a  resolution  involved  creating  systems  that 
determine  when  a  breaking  news  event  might  be  happening,  which 
tilts  results  tied  to  that  event  toward  authority  and  away  from  strict 
relevance,  popularity,  or  recency.  This  helped  display  content  from 
credible sources. 

Furthermore,  while  authoritative  video  content  takes  time,  credible 
text-based  reporting  is  much  quicker.  As  a  result,  YouTube  launched 
a  product  that  displays  an  information  panel  providing  text-based 
breaking  news  content  from  an  authoritative  news  source  while  a 
significant news event is developing. The information panel also links 
directly to the article’s website so that viewers can easily access and 
read the full article about the news event.

Information Panel Providing Breaking News Context 

Once a critical mass of authoritative news videos has been published 
on the topic, Breaking News and Top News shelves begin to take over 
as the primary news consumption experiences on the platform. 

22

How Google Fights Disinformation

The  second  solution  focuses  on  providing  context  to  help  people 
make their own decisions. There are certain instances where YouTube 
provides  viewers  with  additional  information  to  help  them  better 
understand the sources of news content they watch. For example, if a 
channel is owned by a news publisher that is funded by a government, 
or is otherwise publicly funded, an information panel providing publisher 
context  is  displayed  on  the  watch  page  of  the  channel’s  videos.  This 
information panel indicates how the publisher is funded and provides a 
link to the publisher’s Wikipedia page. 

Another information panel product that was launched in 2018 aims to 
provide  additional  factual  information  from  outside  sources  around 
topics that tend to be accompanied by disinformation online, particularly 
on  YouTube.  Users  may  see  panels  alongside  videos  on  topics  such 
as “moon landing hoax” that link to information from credible sources, 
including Encyclopedia Britannica and Wikipedia. 

Information Panel Providing Publisher Context

An  information  panel  providing  topical  context  may  appear  in  Search 
results or on the watch page of videos. It will include basic, independent 
information about a given topic and will link to a third-party website to 
allow viewers to learn more about the topic. This information panel appears alongside all videos related 
to the topic, regardless of the opinions or perspectives expressed in the videos. Information panels do not 
affect any video features or monetization eligibility.

The third solution involves supporting

These 
issues 
important  societal 
go  beyond  any  single  platform 
and  involve  shared  values  across 
our  society.  The  fight  against 
disinformation is only as good as the 
quality of news information available 
in  the  ecosystem,  and  are  intent  on 
doing our part to support the industry 
if we are to truly address the broader 
problem  of  disinformation.  We 
believe  quality  journalism  requires 
sustainable  revenue  streams  and 
that  we  have  a  responsibility  to 
support  innovation  in  products  and 
funding for news.

Information Panel Providing Topical Context on YouTube Search and Watch Pages

Several years ago, YouTube developed a solution in partnership with key publishers to help newsrooms 
improve and maximize their video capabilities. The program is called Player for Publishers, and it allows 
publishers  to  use  YouTube  to  power  the  videos  on  their  sites  and  applications.  The  program  is  free   
and 100% of the advertising revenue for ads sold by the publisher and served on their own properties goes 
to the publisher.

sustainable 

in  building 

In  addition,  last  year,  YouTube  committed  $25M 
in  funding,  as  part  of  a  broader  $300M  investment 
by  the  Google  News  Initiative,33  to  support  news 
organizations 
video 
operations. YouTube announced34 the winners of our 
first ever innovation funding program. These partners 
hail from 23 countries across the Americas, Europe, 
Africa,  and  Asia-Pacific,  representing  a  diverse 
mix  of  broadcasters,  traditional  publishers,  digital 
publishers, news agencies, local media, and creators. 
Best practices gained from this program will be shared publicly via case studies, providing all newsrooms 
the opportunity to learn and apply insights as we work together to support the development of long-term, 
sustainable news video businesses. 

Player for Publishers

In conjunction with this investment, YouTube created a news working group – a quarterly convening of 
news  industry  leaders  with  whom  we  are  collaborating  to  shape  the  future  of  news  on  YouTube.  The 
news working group consists of top broadcasters, publishers, creators, and academics around the world 
and they have been providing feedback on items such as how to better quantify authoritativeness, what 
additional types of information might be useful to provide to users in our information panel projects, and 
what more we can do to support online video operations in newsrooms. Given how complex these issues 
are, we know we can’t work in a silo. We must partner with industry and civil society to come together 
around solutions that work.

3.  We view monetization on our platform as a privilege

Many people use YouTube simply to share their content with the world. Creators who meet the eligibility criteria 
can  apply to join the YouTube Partner Program, which makes their videos eligible to run advertising and earn 
money through Google’s advertising products. Monetizing creators must comply with advertiser-friendly content 
guidelines. Advertising will be disabled from running on videos that violate these policies. 

Over  the  last  few  years,  YouTube  and  Google’s  advertising  products  have  taken  steps  to  strengthen  the 
requirements for monetization so that spammers, impersonators, and other bad actors can’t hurt the ecosystem 
or  take  advantage  of  good  creators.  To  apply  for 
membership  in  the  YouTube  Partner  Program, 
the  thresholds  were  increased  for  channels  to  be 
deemed  eligible.  Channels  must  have  generated 
4,000 watch hours in the previous 12 months and 
have more than 1,000 subscribers. 

Following  application,  YouTube’s  review  team 
ensures 
the  channel  has  not  run  afoul  of 
monetization, content, and copyright policies prior 
to  admitting  them  to  the  program.  Only  creators 
with sufficient history and demonstrated advertiser 
safety will receive access to ads and other monetization products. In changing these thresholds, YouTube has 
significantly improved the protections in place against impersonating creators.

Process for Admittance to YouTube Partner Program

More information on how Google protects its monetization services from abuse is discussed in the next section, 
“Google Ads &amp; Disinformation”.

Google Advertising  
Products &amp; Disinformation
Background

Google provides multiple products to help content creators – website builders, video makers, and app developers 
–  make  money  from  doing  what  they  love.  Our  advertising  products  enable  creators  to  place  ads  within  the 
content they make and manage the process by which they sell space in that content. In addition, we have products 
for advertisers to purchase that inventory across various content creators.

Google  Ads  and  DV  360  help  businesses of  all  sizes  get  their  messages  to  the  audiences  they  need  to  grow. 
These services are “front doors” for advertisers of all sizes to buy ads across Google’s monetization products 
and platforms – connecting them with billions of people finding answers on Search, watching videos on YouTube, 
exploring new places on Google Maps, discovering apps on Google Play, and more. 

AdSense, AdMob, and Ad Manager, support content creators’ and publishers’ efforts to create and distribute their 
creations. We launched AdSense in 2003 to help publishers fund their content by placing relevant ads on their 
website. Over time, it has become a core part of our advertising products, serving more than 2 million website 
owners around the world.

Our  ads  and  monetization  products  enable  businesses  of  all  sizes  from  around  the  world  to  promote  a  wide 
variety of products, services, applications, and websites on Google and across our partner sites and apps, making 
it possible for Internet users to discover more content they care about.

We  also  understand  that  the  content  of  both  ads  and  publisher  sites  needs  to  be  safe  and  provide  a  positive 
experience for users. We aim to protect users and ensure a positive ad experience across our partner sites and 
apps as well as owned and operated properties like Maps and Gmail, by creating clear policies that govern what 
content can and cannot be monetized. When we create these policies, we think about our values and culture as 
a company, as well as operational, technical, and business considerations. We regularly review changes in online 
trends and practices, industry norms, and regulations to keep our policies up-to-date. And, we listen to our users’ 
feedback and concerns about the types of ads they see. 

As we create new policies and update existing ones, we strive to ensure a safe and positive experience for our 
users.  We  also  consider  the  impact  that  certain  kinds  of  content  will  have  on  our  advertisers  and  publishers. 
For example, some advertisers do not want their ads shown next to particular types of publisher content, and  
vice versa. 

At the same time, we are mindful that the advertisers and publishers who use our services represent a broad 
range of experiences and viewpoints and we don’t want to be in the position of limiting those viewpoints or their 
ability to reach new audiences. 

Oftentimes, these goals are in tension with one another. We aim for a balanced approach that prevents harm to 
our users by putting limits on the types of content we allow to be monetized without being overly restrictive, while 
also creating clear, enforceable, and predictable policies for advertisers and publishers. 

We have a responsibility to balance the imperatives of making sure we leave room for a variety of opinions to be 
expressed, while preventing harmful or misrepresentative content on our advertising platforms. 

25

Tackling disinformation on Google’s  
advertising products 

The considerations described above influence the policies we create for advertisers and publishers, and those 
policies are the primary way by which our advertising platforms implement the strategies to counter disinformation 
that we mention in the opening section of this paper, including: 

•  Counteract Malicious Actors

•  We look for, and take action against, attempts to circumvent our policies.

•  Give Users More Context

•  “Why this ad” labels enabling users to understand why they’re presented with a specific ad and how to 
change their preferences so as to alter the personalization of the ads they are shown, or to opt out of 
personalized ads altogether.

•  In-ad disclosures and transparency reports on election advertising, which are rolling out during elections 

in the U.S., Europe, and India as our starting point.

Google’s  policies  to  tackle  disinformation  on  our  advertising  platforms  favor  an  approach  that  focuses  on 
misrepresentative or harmful behavior by advertisers or publishers while avoiding judgments on the veracity of 
statements made about politics or current events. To that end, we have developed a number of policies designed 
to catch bad behaviors, including many that can be associated with disinformation campaigns.

While we do not classify content specifically as “disinformation”, we do have a number of long-standing content 
policies aimed at preventing deceptive or low-quality content on our platforms. These policies complement, and 
build on, the strategies we outline in the opening section of this paper.

Each  of  these  policies  reflect  a  behavior-based  approach  to  fighting  deceptive  content.  Rather  than  make  a 
judgment on specific claims, we enforce policies against advertiser and publisher behavior that is associated 
with misrepresentative or harmful content. 

The policies described in this document are current as of the publication of this paper but are also subject to 
continual refinement and improvement to take into account emerging trends and threats to ensure the integrity of 
our platforms and the information we are providing to partners and users.

Managing “scraped” or unoriginal content

In order to ensure a good experience for users and advertisers, we have policies for publishers that limit or disable 
ad serving on pages with little to no value and/or excessive advertising.35 This results in a significant number of 
policy violations. In 2017, we blocked over 12,000 websites for “scraping,” duplicating and copying content from 
other sites, up from 10,000 in 2016.36 

Also,  Google  Ads  does  not  allow  advertisements  that  point  users  to  landing  pages  with  insufficient  original 
content. This includes content that is replicated from another source without providing any additional value in 
the form of added content or functionality. For example, a site that consists of news articles that are scraped 
from other sources without adding additional commentary or value to the user would not be allowed to advertise  
with us.37

26

Misrepresentation

We have long prevented ads that intend to deceive users by excluding relevant information or giving misleading 
information about products, services, or businesses. This includes making false statements about the advertiser’s 
identity or qualifications, or making false claims that entice a user with an improbable result. 

Our  policies  on  misrepresentation  were  extended  to  content  that  is  available  via  our  monetization  products 
(AdSense, AdMob, and Ad Manager) in 2016, and are publicly available online.38

We made an additional update to our Google Ads and AdSense policies in 2018 to specifically state that it’s not 
acceptable to direct content about politics, social issues, or matters of public concern to users in a country other 
than your own, if you misrepresent or conceal your country of origin or other material details about yourself or 
your organization. 

Inappropriate content

We also have long-standing policies to disallow monetization of shocking, dangerous, or inappropriate content 
on our advertising platforms, the details of which are publicly available online.39 This includes derogatory content, 
shocking or violent content, or ads that lack reasonable sensitivity toward a tragic event.

Political influence operations 

As  discussed  in  a  blog  post  in  August  2018,  we  have  also  conducted  investigations  into  foreign  influence 
operations on our advertising platforms.40 To complement the work of our internal teams, we engage independent 
cybersecurity experts and top security consultants to provide us with intelligence on these operations. Actors 
engaged in these types of influence operations violate our policies and we swiftly remove such content from our 
services and terminate these actors’ accounts. 

Election integrity

When it comes to elections, we recognize that it is critical to support democratic processes by helping users get 
important voting information, including insights into who is responsible for the political advertising content they 
see on our platforms. 

Beginning  with  the  2018  U.S.  Congressional  midterm  election,  we  require  additional  verification  for  anyone 
who  wants  to  purchase  an  election  ad  on  Google  in  the  U.S.,  and  require  that  advertisers  confirm  they  are  a 
U.S.  citizen  or  lawful  permanent  resident.41  In  an  effort  to  provide  transparency  around  who  is  paying  for  an 
election ad, we also require that ad creatives incorporate a clear disclosure of who is paying for it. Additionally, 
we released a Transparency Report specifically focused on election ads.42 This Report describes who  is  buying  
election-related   ads   on   our   platforms   and   how   much   money   is  being  spent.  We  have  also  built  a  searchable 
library  for  election  ads  where  anyone  can  find  election  ads  purchased  on  Google  and  who  paid  for  them.43  
In  parallel,  we  updated  our  personalized  ads  policies  to  require  verification  for  all  advertisers  who  use  our 
limited  political  affiliation  options  to  target  ads  to  users  or  to  promote  advertisers’  products  and  services 
in the United States.44

27


--- Page 29 ---

As  we  look  ahead  to  2019,  we  are  also 
planning  to  extend  these  election  integrity 
efforts to other elections around the globe. 
Similar  to  our  approach  for  U.S.  federal 
elections,  we  will  be  requiring  verification 
and  disclosure  for  election  ads  in  the 
European  Union  Parliamentary  elections45 
Indian  Lok  Sabha  election.46  
and  the 
that  mention  a  political  party, 
Ads 
candidate,  or  current  office  holder  will 
be  verified  by  Google  and  be  required  to 
disclose to voters who is paying for the ad. 
We will also be introducing respective Political Ads Transparency Reports and searchable ad libraries for each of 
these elections that will provide more information about who is purchasing election ads, who is being targeted, 
and how much money is being spent.

The new political advertising section in our Transparency Report shows how much 

money is spent across states and congressional districts for U.S. federal elections

In  addition  to  these  specific  efforts,  we’re 
thinking  hard  about  elections  and  how  we 
continue to support democratic processes 
around  the  world,  including  by  bringing 
more  transparency  to  political  advertising 
online, by helping connect people to useful 
and  relevant  election-related  information, 
and  by  working 
to  protect  election 
information  online.  We  will  continue  to 
invest  in  initiatives  that  build  further  on  
our commitment to election transparency.

Consistent Enforcement

The political advertising section in our U.S. Transparency Report also shows which ads had the highest 

views, the latest election ads running on our platform, and explores specific advertisers’ campaigns

Our enforcement teams use a variety of robust methods to ensure content on our advertising platforms adheres 
to our policies, including machine learning, human review, and other technological methods. This approach is very 
similar to the one used by YouTube and described earlier in this paper. We have always relied on a combination of 
humans and technology to enforce our policies and will continue to do so. 

When  we  find  policy  violations  we  take  action  to  enforce  our  policies.  Depending  on  the  policy  violation,  this 
can include blocking a particular ad from appearing and removing ads from a publisher page or site. In cases of 
repeated or egregious violations, we may disable an account altogether.47/48  Every year we publish a report on our 
efforts to remove bad actors from our advertising ecosystem.49

We also know that some content, even if it complies with our policies, may not be something that all advertisers 
want  to  be  associated  with.  That’s  why,  in  addition  to  these  policies,  we  provide  advertisers  with  additional 
controls, and help them exclude certain types of content that, while in compliance with our policies, may not fit 
their brand or business. These controls let advertisers exclude certain types of content or terms from their video, 
display and search advertising campaigns. Advertisers can exclude whole categories of content such as politics, 
news, sports, beauty, fashion, and many others. Similarly, publishers can also review and block certain ads from 
showing on their pages, including by specific advertiser URL, general ad category like “apparel” or “vehicles”, and 
sensitive ad category like “religion” or “politics”.

How Google Fights Disinformation


--- Page 30 ---

Conclusion

Tackling  the  propagation  of  false  or  misleading  information  is  core  to  Google’s  mission  and  to  ensuring  our 
products remain useful to the billions of users and partners who utilize our services every day. While we have 
always fought against malicious actors’ efforts to manipulate our systems and deceive our users, it’s never been 
more important to thwart them and to ensure we provide our users with information worthy of the trust they have 
in our services. 

As we have outlined in this paper, this is not a straightforward endeavor. Disinformation and misinformation can 
take many shapes, manifest differently in different products, and raise significant challenges when it comes to 
balancing risks of harm to good faith, free expression, with the imperative to serve users with information they 
can trust. 

We  believe  that  we’re  at  our  best  when  we  improve  our  products  so  they  continue  to  make  quality  count,  to 
counteract  malicious  actors,  and  to  give  users  context,  as  well  as  working  beyond  our  products  to  support  a 
healthy journalistic ecosystem, partner with civil society and researchers, and stay one step ahead of future risks. 

We  are  constantly  striving  to  make  progress  on  these  issues. This  is  by  no  means  a  solved  problem,  and  we 
know  that  we  have  room  to  make  progress.  We  welcome  a  constructive  dialogue  with  governments,  civil 
society, academia, and newsrooms on what more can be done to address the challenges of misinformation and 
disinformation and hope that this paper will be useful in sparking these conversations.

Eden-Monaro by-election [SEC=UNCLASSIFIED]
Thursday, 4 June 2020 12:22:28 PM

Subject:
Date:

Dear 

As you may be aware, a federal by-election has been called for the division of Eden-
Monaro in New South Wales for Saturday 4 July 2020.  As with all federal electoral
events, the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) is concerned that information is
not published that breaches the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 or contains
disinformation that can mislead voters about the electoral process or their obligations
under the Electoral Act.

The AEC is aware of the steps Twitter has taken since the 2019 Federal Election to
ban political and electoral advertisements.  Given the changes that have occurred
since May 2019, it would be good to arrange a teleconference to speak with you in
the next week.

Can you please also confirm the AEC’s point of contact at Twitter, if the AEC identifies
any communications on your platform that breach the Electoral Act.   As with the
Federal Election, the urgency of any requests we make increases the closer we are to
polling day.

Yours sin

Hi Julie,

Thank you for finding an alternative time for us. Before you bump the existing

invite on Tuesday, could you give me until tommorow midday to confirm with my

stakeholders? 

We should be fine but I just thought to double check internally again.

Thanks</pre>

Hi 

Thank you for reaching out. I had intended to create an agenda, however there’s really one one/two
components we’re looking to cover here. As we have invited a few members from the broader
Electoral Integrity Assurance Taskforce (EIAT), we’re hoping this meeting can focus more on escalation
and civic integrity policy pieces. I know you previously provided us with some documentation in this
realm so I will attach it to the meeting invite as a refresher for attendees.

We will look to schedule a meeting with only internal AEC staff to further discuss campaigns, comms
and civic engagement.

Please let me know if you require further discussion. Thanks again!

Kind regards,

Hi Anastasia,

I hope you had a good weekend!

Ahead of tomorrow afternoon, I just wanted to check in and confirm what topics the meeting will focus
on? We had briefly mentioned splitting up the follow up sessions between more campaigns, comms
and civic engagement focused discussions, and the escalation and civic integrity policy pieces. Would
be fantastic to understand where you&#39;re looking to dig in tomorrow, so we can ensure we come
prepared to make the best use of your time. 

We&#39;re very much looking forward to the meeting, please let me know if you have any questions for us
and we&#39;ll be happy to assist.

All the best,

Apologies for delayed response, has been a busy morning here.  

Meeting invite has been amended to include

We have not assigned specific timings to agenda items (and I have just realised my creative numbering system on 
the agenda!) however the bulk of the conversation tomorrow should be focussed on your background, and our last 
item on working together. The agenda is optimistic in expectations that we cover all items in the detail that would 
be required, so I anticipate we will use this time to also discover what each of us would like to look at in more 
detail, and then we can focus any subsequent conversations. Are you happy with that proposal? 

Please give me a call if you would like to chat.

Good morning Julie, 

Thank you for your email. As you noted, 

is currently on a period of unavoidable leave (moving 

to BCC).   

We are keen to proceed with the initial meeting and our Senior Director of Public Policy for JAPAC and 
India, 

 (cc&#39;d), will represent Twitter, alongside myself, Public Policy Associate for ANZ.  

Please let me know if you have any questions and I&#39;ll be happy to assist.

Policy:  

FI is likely to be a break of 
platforms’ own terms of use 

Operational:

Foreign

This scenario 
notes the 
difference 
between the 
legislated and

of “foreign 
interference”, and 
the differing 
approaches taken 
by policy agencies 
(CFICC), and 
operational 
agencies/bodies 
(including the CFI 
Taskforce). 

Examples 
Policy:  

Social media accounts 
that appear to: 

•  amplify, then 

consistently promote 
divisive political 
positions designed to 
fragment the 
electorate, 
•  target specific 

demographics within 
the electorate with 
messaging designed to 
influence voting 
behaviour. 

Operational:  

To be actionable under 
s92, FI activity must meet 
the elements specified in 
s92, notably: 1. Conduct; 
2. done on half 
of/directed by a Foreign 
Principal; 3. to achieve 
one of the four stated 
intentions; 4. done 
covertly/deceptively/with 
menace/etc

We would like to dial in and introduce our Trust and Safety colleagues (based in Singapore) who have oversight of 
TikTok&#39;s content moderation policies and respond to election day incidents on-platform. In our prior meetings with 
the WAEC and TEC, they presented an overview of TikTok&#39;s election related policies/processes and were able to

The federal election is due to be held anytime from August 2021 through to May 2022 and, as I’m sure you’ll 
agree, quite a lot has happened in the world of elections and communication since the previous Australian 
federal election held in 2019. This continually evolving landscape makes clear the importance of our mutual 
understanding and, in certain areas, collaboration.

In addition to our role as the election’s administrator, we chair the Electoral Integrity Assurance Taskforce – a 
cross-Government cooperation between agencies on matters relating to electoral integrity – and we’d envisage 
that our engagement with your organisation would also involve representatives from a couple of the pertinent 
participating Taskforce agencies. With respect to an agenda - we’ll be eager to hear about any recent or pending 
changes to your platform that are of relevance to communication during an electoral event, will provide an 
update ourselves and of course seek to establish the appropriate enquiry and/or referral lines for issues that 
may arise from communication on your platform.  

Julie Igglesden (cc’d into this email) is the AEC’s Electoral Interference Coordinator and will be in touch to setup 
a meeting shortly. If there is a preferred contact for this liaison then please do advise Julie as soon as you’re 
able.  

Regards,

notes the 
difference 
between the 
legislated and

definitions of 
“foreign

differing 
approaches 
taken by policy 
agencies 
(CFICC), and 
operational 
agencies/bodie

CFI Taskforce). 

Policy:  

Policy:  

FI is likely to be a break 
of platforms’ own terms 
of use 

Operational: 

Division 92, Part 5.2 
Criminal Code Act 1995  

Detection and attribution 
can be time and resource 
intensive, while 
disinformation strategies 
are cheap and agile. 

Social media accounts 
that appear to: 

● amplify, then 
consistently 
promote divisive 
political positions 
designed to 
fragment the 
electorate, 
● target specific 
demographics 
within the 
electorate with 
messaging designed 
to influence voting 
behaviour. 

Operational:  

To be actionable 
under s92, FI activity 
must meet the 
elements specified in 
s92, notably: 1. 
Conduct; 2. done on 
half of/directed by a 
Foreign Principal; 3. 
to achieve one of the 
four stated 
intentions; 4. done 
covertly/deceptively/

is safe.

Hi Julie,

Would you be able to invite my following colleagues to the Teams meeting for Thursday:

, GM 

 - He will be attending in-person with 

and I.

 CISO 

, TnS

 TnS 

 TnS  

 (tbc she is likely to be unavailable)

I have tried forwarding your invite email but my colleagues cant see it/click yes (probably

because I am not the admin and your settings dont allow me to invite others).

Also, prior to the meeting would be able to double check that the Teams meeting has sharing

permissions on? That way myself and my colleagues can share to the room. As backup my

laptop does have a HDMI port and I can send through the slidedeck on the day if need be.

Kind regards</pre>

Morning 

,  

Please see below for proposed agenda for our meeting on Friday. Please let me know if you 
would like any additions or amendments at this time.  

Looking at the length of the agenda and given you have committed to travel for this meeting, 
would you be open to extending the length to 1.5hrs? This should allow us to get into some more 
conversation up front. If required, we will then be able to follow up with some additional video 
conference time.  

Happy to discuss, 

Julie

Do not click links or open \nattachments unless you recognise the sender and know the content is safe. \n\nHi Julie,  \n\nHappy New Year, I hope you had a restful summer shutdown period.  \n\nIn addition to the election preparation we at TikTok have been engaging in prior to the New Year (escalation \nchannels, dedicated TnS resources, PSA's), we are now also looking to create an in-app 'Election Hub' on our \nplatform.  \n\nWe created an Election Hub for the last US Presidential election, and it provides a central source of information/links \n(accessed from our Discover Page) for users on our platform to find accurate information on how to register for a \nelection, when to vote, how to vote, work out where to vote etc. I have attached some examples of what it would \nroughly look like below:  \n\n4\n\n\n--- Page 5 ---\n\nWe were hoping to be able to use links to the AEC's website (and any other publicly available resources you may \nhave) that provide this information in similar fashion to the PSA's we are running with the AEC's support and if \npossible, use the AEC logo in this election hub as a link to the AEC online homepage and to signify to our users that \nthe information is reliable and consistent with the AEC.  \n\nI understand any use of logo's/branding probably needs to be run by a few people, so please let me know if I can \nprovide more information or let me know if there are any concerns from the outset we can address. Whilst we arent \nreally the platform to go to for politics/news we do have young first time voters on TikTok so our view internally is \nthat this Election Hub would be useful for many of our Australian users.  \n\nKind regards  \n\nDISCLAIMER: \n\nIf you have received this transmission in error please notify us immediately by return email and delete all copies.

It  has \nexposed us to perspectives and experiences that were previously out-of-reach. It has enabled increased access \nto knowledge for everyone.\n\nGoogle continues to believe that the Internet is a boon to society \u2013 contributing to global education, healthcare, \nresearch, and economic development by enabling citizens to become more knowledgeable and involved through \naccess to information at an unprecedented scale. \n\nHowever, like other communication channels, the open Internet is vulnerable to the organized propagation of false \nor misleading information. Over the past several years, concerns that we have entered a \u201cpost-truth\u201d era have \nbecome a controversial subject of political and academic debate.\n\nThese  concerns  directly  affect  Google  and  our  mission  \u2013  to  organize  the  world\u2019s  information  and  make  it \nuniversally accessible and useful. When our services are used to propagate deceptive or misleading information, \nour mission is undermined. \n\nHow companies like Google address these concerns has an impact on society and on the trust users place in \nour  services.  We  take  this  responsibility  very  seriously  and  believe  it  begins  with  providing  transparency  into  \nour policies, inviting feedback, enabling users, and collaborating with policymakers, civil society, and academics \naround the world.\n\nThis document outlines our perspective on disinformation and misinformation and how we address it throughout \nGoogle. It begins with the three strategies that comprise our response across products, and an overview of our \nefforts beyond the scope of our products. It continues with an in-depth look at how these strategies are applied, \nand expanded, to Google Search, Google News, YouTube, and our advertising products. \n\nWe welcome a dialogue about what works well, what does not, and how we can work with others in academia, \ncivil society, newsrooms, and governments to meet the ever-evolving challenges of disinformation.\n\nWhat is disinformation?\n\nAs we\u2019ve all experienced over the past few years, the words \u201cmisinformation\u201d, \u201cdisinformation\u201d, and \u201cfake news\u201d \nmean different things to different people and can become politically charged when they are used to characterize \nthe propagators of a specific ideology or to undermine political adversaries. \n\nHowever, there is something objectively problematic and harmful to our users when malicious actors attempt to \ndeceive them. It is one thing to be wrong about an issue. It is another to purposefully disseminate information one \nknows to be inaccurate with the hope that others believe it is true or to create discord in society. \n\nWe refer to these deliberate efforts to deceive and mislead using the speed, scale, and technologies of the open \nweb as \u201cdisinformation\u201d.\n\nThe entities that engage in disinformation have a diverse set of goals. Some are financially motivated, engaging \nin  disinformation  activities  for  the  purpose  of  turning  a  profit.  Others  are  politically  motivated,  engaging  in \ndisinformation  to  foster  specific  viewpoints  among  a  population,  to  exert  influence  over  political  processes, \nor  for  the  sole  purpose  of  polarizing  and  fracturing  societies.  Others  engage  in  disinformation  for  their  own \nentertainment, which often involves bullying, and they are commonly referred to as \u201ctrolls\u201d.\n\n2\n\nHow Google Fights Disinformation\n\n\n--- Page 4 ---\n\nLevels of funding and sophistication vary across those entities, ranging from local mom-and-pop operations to \nwell-funded and state-backed campaigns. In addition, propagators of disinformation sometimes end up working \ntogether, even unwittingly. For instance, politically motivated actors might emphasize a piece of disinformation \nthat financially motivated groups might latch onto because it is getting enough attention to be a potential revenue \nsource. Sometimes, a successful disinformation narrative is propagated by content creators who are acting in \ngood faith and are unaware of the goals of its originators. \n\nThis  complexity  makes  it  difficult  to  gain  a  full  picture  of  the  efforts  of  actors  who  engage  in  disinformation \nor  gauge  how  effective  their  efforts  may  be.  Furthermore,  because  it  can  be  difficult  to  determine  whether  a \npropagator of falsehoods online is acting in good faith, responses to disinformation run the risk of inadvertently \nharming legitimate expression.\n\nTackling disinformation in our products  \nand services\n\nWe have an important responsibility to our users and to the societies in which we operate to curb the efforts \nof  those  who  aim  to  propagate  false  information  on  our  platforms.  At  the  same  time,  we  respect  our  users\u2019 \nfundamental human rights (such as free expression) and we try to be clear and predictable in our efforts, letting \nusers and content creators decide for themselves whether we are operating fairly. Of course, this is a delicate \nbalance, as sharing too much of the granular details of how our algorithms and processes work would make it \neasier for bad actors to exploit them.\n\nWe face complex trade-offs and there is no \u2018silver bullet\u2019 that will resolve the issue of disinformation, because:\n\n\u2022  It can be extremely difficult (or even impossible) for humans or technology to determine the veracity of, or \n\nintent behind, a given piece of content, especially when it relates to current events. \n\n\u2022  Reasonable  people  can  have  different  perspectives  on  the  right  balance  between  risks  of  harm  to  good \n\nfaith, free expression, and the imperative to tackle disinformation. \n\n\u2022  The solutions we build have to apply in ways that are understandable and predictable for users and content \ncreators, and compatible with the kind of automation that is required when operating services on the scale \nof the web. We cannot create standards that require deep deliberation for every individual decision.\n\n\u2022  Disinformation manifests differently on different products and surfaces. Solutions that might be relevant in \none context might be irrelevant or counter-productive in others. Our products cannot operate in the exact \nsame way in that regard, and this is why they approach disinformation in their own specific ways.\n\nOur  approach  to  tackling  disinformation  in  our  products  and  services  is  based  around  a  framework  of  three \nstrategies: make quality count in our ranking systems, counteract malicious actors, and give users more context. \nWe will outline them in this section, as well as the efforts we undertake beyond the scope of our products and \nservices  to  team  up  with newsrooms  and  outside experts, and  to  get ahead of  future  risks. It  is worth noting \nthat  these  strategies  are  also  used  to  address  misinformation  more  broadly,  which  pertains  to  the  overall \ntrustworthiness of the information we provide users in our products.\n\nIn  later  sections  of  this  paper,  we  will  detail  how  these  strategies  are  implemented  and  expanded  for  Google \nSearch, Google News, YouTube, and our advertising platforms. We adopt slightly different approaches in how we \napply these principles to different products given how each service presents its own unique challenges.\n\n3\n\n\n--- Page 5 ---\n\n1.  Make Quality Count\n\nOur products are designed to sort through immense amounts of material and deliver content that best meets \nour users\u2019 needs. This means delivering quality information and trustworthy commercial messages, especially \nin contexts that are prone to rumors and the propagation of false information (such as breaking news events).\n\nWhile each product and service implements this differently, they share important principles that ensure our \nalgorithms treat websites and content creators fairly and evenly: \n\n\u2022  Information is organized by \u201cranking algorithms\u201d. \n\n\u2022  These  algorithms  are  geared  toward  ensuring  the  usefulness  of  our  services,  as  measured  by  user \ntesting,  not  fostering  the  ideological  viewpoints  of  the  individuals  that  build  or  audit  them.  When  it \ncomes  to  Google  Search,  you  can  find  a  detailed  explanation  of  how  those  algorithms  operate  at  \ngoogle.com/search/howsearchworks.\n\n2.  Counteract Malicious Actors\n\nAlgorithms  cannot  determine  whether  a  piece  of  content  on  current  events  is  true  or  false,  nor  can  they \nassess the intent of its creator just by reading what\u2019s on a page. However, there are clear cases of intent to \nmanipulate or deceive users. For instance, a news website that alleges it contains \u201cReporting from Bordeaux, \nFrance\u201d but whose account activity indicates that it is operated out of New Jersey in the U.S. is likely not being \ntransparent with users about its operations or what they can trust it to know firsthand.\n\nThat\u2019s why our policies across Google Search, Google News, YouTube, and our advertising products clearly \noutline behaviors that are prohibited \u2013 such as misrepresentation of one\u2019s ownership or primary purpose on \nGoogle News and our advertising products, or impersonation of other channels or individuals on YouTube. \n\nFurthermore, since the early days of Google and YouTube, many content creators have tried to deceive our \nranking systems to get more visibility \u2013 a set of practices we view as a form of \u2018spam\u2019 and that we\u2019ve invested \nsignificant resources to address. \n\nThis is relevant to tackling disinformation since many of those who engage in the creation or propagation of \ncontent for the purpose to deceive often deploy similar tactics in an effort to achieve more visibility. Over the \ncourse of the past two decades, we have invested in systems that can reduce \u2018spammy\u2019 behaviors at scale, \nand we complement those with human reviews. \n\n4\n\nHow Google Fights Disinformation\n\n\n--- Page 6 ---\n\n3.  Give Users More Context\n\nEasy  access  to  context  and  a  diverse  set  of  perspectives  are  key  to  providing  users  with  the  information \nthey need to form their own views. Our products and services expose users to numerous links or videos in \nresponse to their searches, which maximizes the chances that users are exposed to diverse perspectives or \nviewpoints before deciding what to explore in depth.\n\nGoogle  Search,  Google  News,  YouTube,  and  our  advertising  products  have  all  developed  additional \nmechanisms to provide more context and agency to users. Those include:\n\n\u2022  \u201cKnowledge\u201d  or  \u201cInformation\u201d  Panels  in  Google  Search  and  YouTube,  providing  high-level  facts  about  a \n\nperson or issue. \n\n\u2022  Making it easier to discover the work of fact-checkers on Google Search or Google News, by using labels or \n\nsnippets making it clear to users that a specific piece of content is a fact-checking article.\n\n\u2022  A \u201cFull Coverage\u201d function in Google News enabling users to access a non-personalized, in-depth view of a \n\nnews cycle at the tap of a finger. \n\n\u2022  \u201cBreaking News\u201d and \u201cTop News\u201d shelves, and \u201cDeveloping News\u201d information panels on YouTube, making \nsure that users are exposed to news content from authoritative sources when looking for information about \nongoing news events. \n\n\u2022  Information panels providing \u201cTopical Context\u201d and \u201cPublisher Context\u201d on YouTube, providing users with \ncontextual information from trusted sources to help them be more informed consumers of content on the \nplatform. These panels provide authoritative information on well-established historical and scientific topics \nthat have often been subject to misinformation online and on the sources of news content, respectively. \n\n\u2022  \u201cWhy  this  ad\u201d  labels  enabling  users  to  understand  why  they\u2019re  presented  with  a  specific  ad  and  how  to \nchange  their  preferences  so  as  to  alter  the  personalization  of  the  ads  they  are  shown,  or  to  opt  out  of \npersonalized ads altogether.\n\n\u2022  In-ad disclosures and transparency reports on election advertising, which are rolling out during elections \n\nin the US, Europe, and India as a starting point.\n\nWe also empower users to let us know when we\u2019re getting it wrong by using feedback buttons across Search, \nYouTube, and our advertising products to flag content that might be violating our policies.\n\nTeaming up with newsrooms and outside experts\n\nOur  work  to  address  disinformation  is  not  limited  to  the  scope  of  our  products  and  services.  Indeed, \nother  organizations  play  a  fundamental  role  in  addressing  this  societal  challenge,  such  as  newsrooms,  \nfact-checkers,  civil  society  organizations,  or  researchers.  While  we  all  address  different  aspects  of  this  issue, \nit is only by coming together that we can succeed. That is why we dedicate significant resources to supporting \nquality  journalism,  and  to  weaving  together  partnerships  with  many  other  organizations  in  this  space. \n\n5\n\n\n--- Page 7 ---\n\nSupporting quality journalism\n\nPeople come to Google looking for information they can trust and that information often comes from the reporting \nof journalists and news organizations around the world.\n\nA thriving news ecosystem matters deeply to Google and directly impacts our efforts to combat disinformation. \nWhen quality journalism struggles to reach wide audiences, malicious actors have more room to propagate false \ninformation. \n\nOver the years, we\u2019ve worked closely with the news industry to address these challenges and launched products \nand programs to help improve the business model of online journalism. These include the Accelerated Mobile \nPages  Project1  to  improve  the  mobile  web,  YouTube  Player  for  Publishers2  to  simplify  video  distribution  and \nreduce costs, and many more.\n\nIn  March  2018,  we  launched  the  Google  News  Initiative  (GNI)3  to  help  journalism  thrive  in  the  digital  age.  \nWith a $300 million commitment over 3 years, the initiative aims to elevate and strengthen quality journalism, \nevolve  business  models  to  drive  sustainable  growth,  and  empower  news  organizations  through  technological \ninnovation. $25M of this broader investment was earmarked as innovation grants for YouTube to support news \norganizations in building sustainable video operations.\n\nOne  of  the  programs  supported  by  the  Google  News  Initiative  is  Subscribe  with  Google4,  a  way  for  people  to \neasily  subscribe  to  various  news  outlets,  helping  publishers  engage  readers  across  Google  and  the  web. \nAnother  is  News  Consumer  Insights,  a  new  dashboard  built  on  top  of  Google  Analytics,  which  will  help  news \norganizations  of  all  sizes  understand  and  segment  their  audiences  with  a  subscriptions  strategy  in  mind.  \nMore details on these projects and others can be found at g.co/newsinitiative.\n\nPartnering with outside experts\n\nAddressing disinformation is not something we can do on our own. The Google News Initiative also houses our \nproducts, partnerships, and programs dedicated to supporting news organizations in their efforts create quality \nreporting that displaces disinformation. This includes:\n\n\u2022  Helping  to  launch  the  First  Draft  Coalition  (https://firstdraftnews.org/),  a  nonprofit  that  convenes  news \norganizations and technology companies to tackle the challenges around combating disinformation online \n\u2013 especially in the run-up to elections. \n\n\u2022  Participating in and providing financial support to the Trust Project (http://thetrustproject.org/), of which \nGoogle  is  a  founding  member  and  which  explores  how  journalism  can  signal  its  trustworthiness  online. \nThe Trust Project has developed eight indicators of trust that publishers can use to better convey why their \ncontent should be seen as credible, with promising results for the publishers who have trialed them.\n\n\u2022  Partnering  with  Poynter\u2019s  International  Fact-Checking  Network  (IFCN)5,  a  nonpartisan  organization \ngathering  fact-checking  organizations  from  the  United  States,  Germany,  Brazil,  Argentina,  South  Africa, \nIndia, and more. \n\nIn  addition,  we  support  the  work  of  researchers  who  explore  the  issues  of  disinformation  and  trust  in  \njournalism by funding research at organizations like First Draft, the Oxford University\u2019s Reuters News Institute,  \nMichigan University\u2019s Quello Center for Telecommunication Management law, and more. \n\n6\n\nHow Google Fights Disinformation\n\n\n--- Page 8 ---\n\nFinally, in March 2018, Google.org (Google\u2019s philanthropic arm) launched a $10 million global initiative to support \nmedia literacy around the world in the footsteps of programs we have already supported in the UK, Brazil, Canada, \nIndonesia, and more. \n\nWe will continue to explore more ways to partner with others on these issues, whether by building new products \nthat might benefit the work of journalists and fact-checkers, supporting more independent initiatives that help \ncurb disinformation, or developing self-regulatory practices to demonstrate our responsibility.\n\nGetting ahead of future risks\n\nCreators of disinformation will never stop trying to find new ways to deceive users. It is our responsibility to make \nsure we stay ahead of the game. Many of the product strategies and external partnerships mentioned earlier help \nus reach that goal. In addition, we dedicate specific focus to bolstering our defenses in the run-up to elections \nand invest in research and development efforts to stay ahead of new technologies or tactics that could be used \nby malicious actors, such as synthetic media (also known as \u2018deep fakes\u2019).\n\nProtecting elections\n\nFair elections are critical to the health of democracy and we take our work to protect elections very seriously. Our \nproducts can help make sure users have access to accurate information about elections. For example, we often \npartner with election commissions, or other official sources, to make sure key information like the location of \npolling booths or the dates of the votes are easily available to users. \n\nWe  also  work  to  protect  elections  from  attacks  and  interference,  including  focusing  on  combating  political \ninfluence operations, improving account and website security, and increasing transparency.\n\nTo prevent political influence operations, working with our partners at Jigsaw, we have multiple internal teams \nthat identify malicious actors wherever they originate, disables their accounts, and shares threat information with \nother companies and law enforcement officials. We routinely provide public updates about these operations.7\n\nThere  is  more  we  can  do  beyond  protecting  our  own  platforms.  Over  the  past  several  years,  we  have  taken \nsteps  to  help  protect  accounts,  campaigns,  candidates,  and  officials  against  digital  attacks.  Our  Protect  Your \nElection project8 offers a suite of extra security to protect against malicious or insecure apps and guards against \nphishing. To protect election and campaign websites, we also offer Project Shield9, which can mitigate the risk of \nDistributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. \n\nIn the run-up to elections, we provide free training to ensure that campaign professionals and political parties are \nup-to-speed on the means to protect themselves from attack. For instance, in 2018, we trained more than 1,000 \ncampaign professionals and the eight major U.S. Republican and Democratic committees on email and campaign \nwebsite security. \n\nFurthermore,  as  a  part  of  our  security  efforts,  for  the  past  eight  years,  we  have  displayed  warnings  to  Gmail \nusers who are at risk of phishing by potentially state-sponsored actors (even though, in most cases, the specific \nphishing attempt never reaches the user\u2019s inbox). \n\n7\n\n\n--- Page 9 ---\n\nFinally, in order to help understand the context for the election-related ads they see online, we require additional \nverification for advertisers who wish to purchase political ads in the United States, provide transparency about the \nadvertiser to the user, and have established an online transparency report and creative repository on US federal \nelections.10\n\nWe look forward to expanding these tools, trainings, and strategies to more elections in 2019, starting with efforts \nfocused on two of the world\u2019s largest upcoming elections, which are in Europe11 and in India.12\n\nExpecting the unexpected \n\nCreators of disinformation are constantly exploring new ways to bypass the defenses set by online services in an \neffort to spread their messages to a wider audience.\n\nTo  stay  ahead  of  the  curve,  we  continuously  invest  resources  to  stay  abreast  of  the  next  tools,  tactics,  or \ntechnologies that creators of disinformation may attempt to use. We convene with experts all around the world \nto understand what concerns them. We also invest in research, product, and policy developments to anticipate \nthreat vectors that we might not be equipped to tackle at this point. \n\nOne example is the rise of new forms of AI-generated, photo-realistic, synthetic audio or video content known as \n\u201csynthetic media\u201d (often referred to as \u201cdeep fakes\u201d). While this technology has useful applications (for instance, \nby opening new possibilities to those affected by speech or reading impairments, or new creative grounds for \nartists and movie studios around the world), it raises concerns when used in disinformation campaigns and for \nother malicious purposes.\n\nThe field of synthetic media is fast-moving and it is hard to predict what might happen in the near future. To help \nprepare for this issue, Google and YouTube are investing in research to understand how AI might help detect such \nsynthetic content as it emerges, working with leading experts in this field from around the world.\n\nFinally,  because  no  detector  can  be  perfect,  we  are  engaging  with  civil  society,  academia,  newsrooms,  and \ngovernments to share our best understanding of this challenge and work together on what other steps societies \ncan  take  to  improve  their  preparedness.  This  includes  exploring  ways  to  help  others  come  up  with  their  own \ndetection tools. One example may involve releasing datasets of synthesized content that others can use to train \nAI-based detectors.13\n\n8\n\nHow Google Fights Disinformation\n\n\n--- Page 10 ---\n\nGoogle Search,  \nGoogle News & Disinformation \nBackground\n\nGoogle  created  its  search  engine  in  1998,  with  a  mission  to  organize  the  world\u2019s  information  and  make  it \nuniversally accessible and useful. At the time, the web consisted of just 25 million pages. \n\nToday, we index hundreds of billions of pages \u2013 more information than all the libraries in the world could hold and \nserve people all over the world. Search is offered in more than 150 languages and over 190 countries. \n\nWe continue to improve on Search every day. In 2017 alone, Google conducted more than 200,000 experiments \nthat resulted in about 2,400 changes to Search. Each of those changes is tested to make sure it aligns with our \npublicly available Search Quality Rater Guidelines,14 which define the goals of our ranking systems and guide the \nexternal evaluators who provide ongoing assessments of our algorithms.\n\nOver the past 20 years, we have grappled with the tension between the open access to information and expression \nthat  the  web  enables  and  the  need  to  ensure  trust  in  authoritative  information.  Our  work  on  disinformation \ncontinues to be informed by these dual goals, as we attempt to strike the right balance in tackling this challenge. \n\nDifferent  types  of  content  may  require  different  approaches  to  ranking  and  presentation  in  order  to  meet  our \nusers\u2019  needs.  Google  News  arose  from  such  a  realization  and  was  one  of  the  first  products  Google  launched \nbeyond Search. Former Googler Krishna Bharat observed that when people searched for news after the tragic \n9/11 attacks in New York, Google responded with old news stories about New York rather than the latest events. \nHe set about to fix that, and on September 22, 2002, Google News was born.\n\nOver  time,  Google  News  has  improved,  including  how  we  present  content  related  to  current  events  in  Google \nSearch. In 2018, we launched a reimagined Google News that uses a new set of AI techniques to take a constant \nflow of information as it hits the web, analyze it in real-time, and organize it around breaking news events.15\n\nin  our  mission  and \n\nThrough  all  of  this,  we\u2019ve  remained \ngrounded \nthe \nimportance  of  providing  greater  access \nto  information,  helping  users  navigate \nthe  open  web.  We  continue  to  believe \nthat  this  access \nis  fundamental  to \nhelping people make sense of the world \naround  them,  exercise  their  own  critical \nthinking,  and  make  informed  decisions \nas citizens.\n\nGoogle News App\n\n9\n\n\n--- Page 11 ---\n\nTackling disinformation on Google Search  \n& Google News\n\nSince  Google\u2019s  early  days,  malicious  actors  have  attempted  to  harm  or  deceive  Search  users  through  a  wide \nrange  of  actions,  including  tricking  our  systems  in  order  to  promote  their  own  content  (via  a  set  of  practices \nwe refer to as \u201cspam\u201d), propagating malware, and engaging in illegal acts online. The creators and purveyors of \ndisinformation employ many of the same tactics.\n\nDisinformation  poses  a  unique  challenge.  Google  is  not  in  a  situation  to  assess  objectively,  and  at  scale,  the \nveracity of a piece of content or the intent of its creators. Further, a considerable percentage of content contains \ninformation that cannot be objectively verified as fact. This is because it either lacks necessary context, because \nit is delivered through an ideological lens others may disagree with, or because it is constructed from contested \ndatapoints. \n\nDisinformation  also  raises  broader  concerns  of  harm.  In  the  worst  cases,  the  impacts  of  disinformation \ncampaigns can affect an entire society. The stakes of accurately identifying disinformation are higher because \ndisinformation often concerns issues at the core of political society for which the free exchange of ideas and \ninformation among genuine voices is of the greatest importance.\n\nTo deal with this issue, Google Search and Google News take a pragmatic approach that reinforces the product \nstrategies we have highlighted in the opening section of this paper:\n\n\u2022  Make Quality Count\n\n\u2022  We use ranking algorithms to elevate authoritative, high-quality information in our products.\n\n\u2022  We  take  additional  steps  to  improve  the  quality  of  our  results  for  contexts  and  topics  that  our  users \n\nexpect us to handle with particular care.\n\n\u2022  Counteract Malicious Actors\n\n\u2022  We  look  for  and  take  action  against  attempts  to  deceive  our  ranking  systems  or  circumvent  \n\nour policies.\n\n\u2022  Give Users More Context\n\n\u2022  We provide users with tools to access the context and diversity of perspectives they need to form their \n\nown views.\n\n10\n\nHow Google Fights Disinformation\n\n\n--- Page 12 ---\n\nDo Google News and Google Search combat disinformation  \nin the same ways? \n\nGoogle News\u2019 focus \u2013 coverage of current events \u2013 is narrower than that of Google Search. However, their \ngoals are closely related. Both products present users with trustworthy results that meet their information \nneeds about the issues they care about. \n\nFor that reason, both products have a lot in common when it comes to the way they operate For instance, \nranking in Google News is built on the basis of Google Search ranking and they share the same defenses \nagainst \u201cspam\u201d (attempts at gaming our ranking systems).\n\nIn addition, both products share some fundamental principles: \n\n\u2022  They use algorithms, not humans, to determine the ranking of the content they show to users No individual \nat Google ever makes determinations about the position of an individual webpage link on a Google Search \nor Google News results page. \n\n\u2022  Our algorithms are geared toward ensuring the usefulness of our services, as measured by user testing, \n\nnot fostering the ideological viewpoints of the individuals who build or audit them. \n\n\u2022  The  systems  do  not  make  subjective  determinations  about  the  truthfulness  of  webpages,  but  rather \nfocus  on  measurable  signals  that  correlate  with  how  users  and  other  websites  value  the  expertise, \ntrustworthiness, or authoritativeness of a webpage on the topics it covers. \n\nThat said, because Google News\u2019 purposes are explicitly narrower than those of Google Search and solely \nfocused on coverage of current events, it builds its own ranking systems and content policies on top of \nthose of Google Search.\n\nWhen it comes to ranking, this means that the systems we use in Google News and in places that are \nfocused  on  News  in  Google  Search  (e.g.  our  \u201cTop  Stories\u201d  Carousel  or  our  \u201cNews\u201d Tab)  make  special \nefforts  to  understand  things  like  the  prominence  of  a  news  story  in  the  media  landscape  of  the  day, \nwhich articles most relate to that story, or which sources are most trusted for specific news topics. It \nalso means that Google News might give additional importance toward factors that indicate a webpage\u2019s \nnewsworthiness  or  journalistic  value  for  users,  such  as  its  freshness  or  (for  specific  tabs  within   \nGoogle News).\n\nWhen it comes to content policies: \n\n\u2022  Google Search aims to make information from the web available to all our users. That\u2019s why we do not \nremove  content  from  results  in  Google  Search,  except  in  very  limited  circumstances.  These  include \nlegal  removals,  violations  of  our  webmaster  guidelines,  or  a  request  from  the  webmaster  responsible  \nfor the page. \n\n\u2022  Google Search contains some features that are distinct from its general results, such as Autocomplete. \nFor  features  where  Google  specifically  promotes  or  highlights  content,  we  may  remove  content  that \nviolates their specific policies.16\n\n\u2022  Because  Google  News  does  not  attempt  to  be  a  comprehensive  reflection  of  the  web,  but  instead  to \nfocus  on  journalistic  accounts  of  current  events,  it  has  more  restrictive  content  policies  than  Google \nSearch. Google News explicitly prohibits content that incites, promotes, or glorifies violence, harassment, \nor dangerous activities. Similarly, Google News does not allow sites or accounts that impersonate any \nperson or organization, that misrepresent or conceal their ownership or primary purpose, or that engage \nin coordinated activity to mislead users.17\n\n11\n\n\n--- Page 13 ---\n\nWith those nuances in mind, it is still safe to think of Google News and Google Search\u2019s approaches to \ndisinformation  and  misinformation  are  mostly  similar,  and  the  content  of  the  following  sections  apply \nto both products. Where there is a difference, it will be outlined explicitly in the body of the text or in a \ndedicated callout box.\n\nWe use ranking algorithms to elevate high-quality  \ninformation in our products\n\nRanking  algorithms  are  an  important  tool  in  our  fight  against  disinformation.  Ranking  elevates  the  relevant \ninformation that our algorithms determine is the most authoritative and trustworthy above information that may \nbe less reliable. These assessments may vary for each webpage on a website and are directly related to our users\u2019 \nsearches. For instance, a national news outlet\u2019s articles might be deemed authoritative in response to searches \nrelating to current events, but less reliable for searches related to gardening.\n\nFor most searches that could potentially surface misleading information, there is high-quality information that \nour ranking algorithms can detect and elevate. When we succeed in surfacing high-quality results, lower quality \nor outright malicious results (such as disinformation or otherwise deceptive pages) are relegated to less visible \npositions in Search or News, letting users begin their journey by browsing more reliable sources.\n\nOur ranking system does not identify the intent or factual accuracy of any given piece of content. However, it is \nspecifically designed to identify sites with high indicia of expertise, authority, and trustworthiness.\n\nHow do Google\u2019s algorithms assess expertise, authority,  \nand trustworthiness?\n\n\u2022  Google\u2019s algorithms identify signals about pages that correlate with trustworthiness and authoritativeness. \nThe  best  known  of  these  signals  is  PageRank,  which  uses  links  on  the  web  to  understand \nauthoritativeness.\n\n\u2022  We are constantly evolving these algorithms to improve results \u2013 not least because the web itself keeps \nchanging.  For  instance,  in  2017  alone,  we  ran  over  200,000  experiments  with  trained  external  Search \nEvaluators and live user tests, resulting in more than 2,400 updates to Google Search algorithms.\n\n\u2022  To perform these evaluations, we work with Search Quality Evaluators who help us measure the quality \nof Search results on an ongoing basis. Evaluators assess whether a website provides users who click on \nit with the content they were looking for, and they evaluate the quality of results based on the expertise, \nauthoritativeness, and trustworthiness of the content.\n\n\u2022  The resulting ratings do not affect the ranking of any individual website, but they do help us benchmark \nthe quality of our results, which in turn allows us to build algorithms that globally recognize results that \nmeet high-quality criteria. To ensure a consistent approach, our evaluators use the Search Quality Rater \nGuidelines (publicly available online)18 which provide guidance and examples for appropriate ratings. To \nensure  the  consistency  of  the  rating  program,  Search  Quality  evaluators  must  pass  a  comprehensive \nexam and are audited on a regular basis.\n\n\u2022  These  evaluators  also  perform  evaluations  of  each  improvement  to  Search  we  roll  out:  in  side-by-side \nexperiments,  we  show  evaluators  two  different  sets  of  Search  results,  one  with  the  proposed  change \nalready implemented and one without. We ask them which results they prefer and why. This feedback is \ncentral to our launch decisions.\n\nFor more information about how our ranking work, please visit:  \nwww.google.com/search/howsearchworks \n\n12\n\nHow Google Fights Disinformation\n\n\n--- Page 14 ---\n\nWe take additional steps to improve the trustworthiness of our results for \ncontexts and topics that our users expect us to handle with particular care. \n\nOur  Search  Quality  Raters  Guidelines  acknowledge  that  some  types  of  pages  could  potentially  impact  the \nfuture  happiness,  health,  financial  stability,  or  safety  of  users.  We  call  those  \u201cYour  Money  or  Your  Life\u201d  pages \nor  YMYL.  We  introduced  the  YMYL  category  in  2014. They  include  financial  transaction  or  information  pages, \nmedical  and  legal  information  pages,  as  well  as  news  articles,  and  public  and/or  official  information  pages \nthat are important for having an informed citizenry. This last category can comprise anything from information \nabout local, state, or national government processes or policies, news about important topics in a given country,  \nor disaster response services. \n\nFor  these  \u201cYMYL\u201d  pages,  we  assume  that \nusers  expect  us  to  operate  with  our  strictest \nstandards  of \ntrustworthiness  and  safety.  \nAs  such,  where  our  algorithms  detect  that \na  user\u2019s  query  relates  to  a  \u201cYMYL\u201d  topic,  we \nwill  give  more  weight  in  our  ranking  systems \nlike  our  understanding  of  the \nto  factors \nauthoritativeness, expertise, or trustworthiness \nof the pages we present in response.\n\nOur Search Quality Raters Guidelines\n\nSimilarly,  we  direct  our  Google  Search \nevaluators  to  be  more  demanding  in  their \nassessment of the quality and trustworthiness \nof  these  page  than  they  would  otherwise. \nin  2016,  we  added  additional \nSpecifically, \nguidance to our Search Quality Rater Guidelines advising evaluators to give lower quality ratings to informational \npages that contain demonstrably inaccurate content or debunked conspiracy theories. While their ratings don\u2019t \ndetermine individual page rankings, they are used to help us gather data on the quality of our results and identify \nareas where we need to improve. This data from Search Evaluators also plays a significant role in determining \nwhich changes we roll out to our ranking systems. \n\nBeyond specific types of content that are more sensitive to users, we realize that some contexts are more prone \nto the propagation of disinformation than others. For instance, breaking news events, and the heightened level \nof interest that they elicit, are magnets for bad behavior by malicious players. Speculation can outrun facts as \nlegitimate news outlets on the ground are still investigating. At the same time, malicious actors are publishing \ncontent on forums and social media with the intent to mislead and capture people\u2019s attention as they rush to \nfind trusted information. To reduce the visibility of this type of content, we have designed our systems to prefer \nauthority over factors like recency or exact word matches while a crisis is developing.\n\nIn  addition,  we  are  particularly  attentive  to  the  integrity  of  our  systems  in  the  run-up  to  significant  societal \nmoments in the countries where we operate, such as elections.19\n\nWe actively look for and take action against attempts to deceive  \nour ranking systems or circumvent our policies.\n\nGoogle  is  designed  to  help  users  easily  discover  and  access  the  webpages  that  contain  the  information  they \nare looking for. Our goals are aligned with those of site owners who publish high-quality content online because \nthey want it to be discovered by users who might be interested. That\u2019s why we provide extensive tools and tips \n\n13\n\n\n--- Page 15 ---\n\nto  help  webmasters  and  developers \nmanage \ntheir  Search  presence  and \nsucceed  in  having  their  content,  sites, \nand  apps  found.  We  provide  interactive \nwebsites, videos, starter guides, frequent \nblog  posts,  user  forums,  and  live  expert \nsupport  to \ninform  webmasters.  Our \npublicly  available  webmaster  guidelines \ncomplement these resources by outlining \nsome  of  the  tips  and  behaviors  that  we \nrecommend webmasters adopt to make \nit  easiest  for  our  systems  to  crawl  and \nindex their websites.20\n\nGoogle Webmaster Guidelines\n\nNot all site owners act in good faith. Since the early days of Google, many have attempted to manipulate their way \nto the top of Search results through deceptive or manipulative behavior, using any insights into the functioning \nof  our  systems  they  can  get  to  try  to  circumvent  them. The  earliest  example  of  such  attempts  dates  back  to \n1999, when Google\u2019s founders published a seminal paper on PageRank, a key innovation in Google\u2019s algorithm.21  \nThe paper described how our algorithms use links between websites as an indicator of authority. Once that paper \nwas published, spammers tried to game Google by paying each other for links. \n\nThese manipulative behaviors aim to elevate websites to users not because they are the best response to a query, \nbut because a webmaster has deceived our systems. As such, they are considered \u201cspam\u201d and run afoul of our \ncore mission. Our webmaster guidelines clearly spell out actions that are prohibited and state that we will take \naction against websites engaging in such behaviors. \n\nWhile  not  all  spammers  engage  in  disinformation,  many  of  the  malicious  actors  who  try  to  distribute \ndisinformation (at all levels of sophistication or funding) engage in some form  of spam. The tactics they use  \nare  similar  to  those  of  other  spammers.  Therefore,  our  work  against  spam  goes  hand-in-hand  with  our  work \nagainst disinformation. \n\nOur algorithms can detect the majority of spam and demote or remove it automatically. The remaining spam is \ntackled manually by our spam removal team, which reviews pages (often based on user feedback) and flags them \nif they violate the Webmaster Guidelines. In 2017, we took action on 90,000 user reports of search spam and \nalgorithmically detected many more times that number.\n\nAs our tactics improve and evolve, so does spam. One of the trends we observed in 2017 was an increase in \nwebsite hacking, both for spamming search ranking and for spreading malware. We focused on reducing this \nthreat  and  were  able  to  detect  and  remove  from  Search  results  more  than  80  percent  of  these  sites  over  the \nfollowing year. \n\nWe continue to be vigilant regarding techniques used by spammers and remain conscientious of what we share \nabout the ways our ranking systems work so as not to create vulnerabilities they can exploit.\n\n14\n\nHow Google Fights Disinformation\n\n\n--- Page 16 ---\n\nGoogle News policies against deceptive content\n\nIn addition to other efforts to fight spam, Google News\u2019 content policies prohibit: \n\n\u2022  Sites or accounts that impersonate any person or organization;\n\n\u2022  Sites that misrepresent or conceal their ownership or primary purpose; \n\n\u2022  Sites or accounts that engage in coordinated activity to mislead users \u2013 including, but not limited to, sites \nor accounts that misrepresent or conceal their country of origin or that direct content at users in another \ncountry under false pretenses.\n\nIn addition to algorithmic signals that might indicate such behavior, where there is an indication that a \npublisher may be violating our policies, such as through a user report or suspicious account activity, our \nTrust and Safety team will investigate and, where appropriate, take action against that site and related \nsites that can be confirmed to be operating in concert.\n\nWe provide users with the context and diversity of perspectives  \nthey need to form their own views.\n\nFrom  the  very  beginning  of  Google  Search,  the  very  nature  of  Google  Search  results  pages  has  ensured  that \nwhen looking for information on news or public interest topics they care about, users are presented with links to \nmultiple websites and perspectives. \n\nThis  remains  true  today.  When  users  search  for  news  on \nlinks. \nGoogle,  they  are  always  presented  with  multiple \nIn  many  cases,  they  are  also  presented  with  additional \nelements  that  help  them  get  more  context  about  their \nsearch.  For  instance,  \u201cKnowledge  Panels\u201d  might  show  in \nSearch  results  to  provide  context  and  basic  information \nabout  people,  places,  or  things  that  Google  knows  about. \nFact-check  tags  or  snippets  might  show  below \nlinks  \nin  Google  Search  and  Google  News,  outlining  that  a  specific \npiece of content purports to fact-check a claim made by a third \nparty.22 Or we might call out related searches or questions that \nusers tend to ask about the topic of a search query. \n\nFact-Check on Google Search\n\nLocal Coverage & Timeline in Google News\n\nIn  Google  News,  additional  cues  may  help  users  pick  up  on  points  of  context  that  are  particularly  relevant  to \nNews stories, such as \u201cOpinion\u201d or \u201cUser-Generated Content\u201d tags under articles that news publishers want to \nsignal as such; or algorithmically generated story timelines that let users explore at-a-glance the milestones of  \na news story over the weeks or months that led to the day\u2019s events. \n\nDoes Google personalize the content that shows in Google Search and \nGoogle News so that users only see news consistent with their views, \nsometimes known as \u201cfilter bubbles\u201d?\n\nWe try to make sure that our users continue to have access to a diversity of websites and perspectives. \nGoogle Search and Google News take different approaches toward that goal.\n\n15\n\n\n--- Page 17 ---\n\nGoogle Search: contrary to popular belief, there is very little personalization in Search based on users\u2019 \ninferred interests or Search history before their current session. It doesn\u2019t take place often and generally \ndoesn\u2019t significantly change Search results from one person to another. Most differences that users see \nbetween their Search results and those of another user typing the same Search query are better explained \nby other factors such as a user\u2019s location, the language used in the search, the distribution of Search index \nupdates throughout our data centers, and more.23 Furthermore, the Top Stories carousel that often shows \nin Search results in response to news-seeking searches is never personalized. \n\nGoogle News: To meet the needs of users who seek information on topics they care about, Google News \naims to strike a balance between providing access to the same content and perspectives as other users \nand presenting content that relates to news topics one cares about. To do this, Google News offers three \ninterconnected ways to discover information: \n\n\u2022  \u2018Headlines\u2019  and  \u2018Top  Stories\u2019:  To  help  users  stay  on  top  of  the  top  trending  news  in  their  country,  the \n\u201cHeadlines\u201d and \u201cTop Stories\u201d tabs shows the major stories and issues that news sources are covering at \nany point in time and shows them to everyone in a non-personalized manner. \n\n\u2022  For You: To help users stay on top of the news that matter to them, the \u201cFor You\u201d tab lets them specify the \ntopics, publications, and locations they are interested in so they can see the news that relates to those \nselections. Additionally, and depending on their permission settings, the \u201cFor You\u201d tab may show them \nnews they may be interested in in light of their past activity on Google products. \n\n\u2022  Full Coverage: To help users access context and diverse perspectives about the news stories they read, the \n\u201cFull Coverage\u201d feature in Google News lets users explore articles and videos from a variety of publishers \nrelated to an article or news story of their choice. The \u201cFull Coverage\u201d feature is not personalized and is \naccessible in one click or tap from most articles in the \u201cFor You\u201d and \u201cHeadlines\u201d tabs. \n\nImportantly, for both services, we never personalize content based on signals relating to point of view \non  issues  and/or  political  leanings  \u2013  our  systems  do  not  collect  such  signals,  nor  do  they  have  an \nunderstanding of political ideologies. \n\nWe constantly improve our algorithms, policies, and partnerships,  \nand are open about issues we have yet to address. \n\nBecause the malicious actors who propagate disinformation have the incentive to keep doing so, they continue to \nprobe for new ways to game our systems, and it is incumbent on us to stay ahead of this technological arms race. \nA compounding factor in that challenge is that our systems are constantly confronted with searches they have \nnever seen before. Every day, 15% of the queries that our users type in the Google Search bar are new.\n\nFor  these  reasons,  we  regularly  evolve  our  ranking  algorithms,  our  content  policies,  and  the  partnerships  \nwe enter into as part of our efforts to curb disinformation. \n\nWe are aware that many issues remain unsolved at this point. For example, a known strategy of propagators of \ndisinformation is to publish a lot of content targeted on \u201cdata voids\u201d, a term popularized by the U.S. based think \ntank Data and Society to describe Search queries where little high-quality content exists on the web for Google to \ndisplay due to the fact that few trustworthy organizations cover them.24 This often applies, for instance, to niche \nconspiracy theories, which most serious newsrooms or academic organizations won\u2019t make the effort to debunk. \nAs a result, when users enter Search terms that specifically refer to these theories, ranking algorithms can only \nelevate links to the content that is actually available on the open web \u2013 potentially including disinformation. \n\nWe  are  actively  exploring  ways  to  address  this  issue,  and  others,  and  welcome  the  thoughts  and  feedback  \nof researchers, policymakers, civil society, and journalists around the world.\n\n16\n\nHow Google Fights Disinformation\n\n\n--- Page 18 ---\n\nYouTube & \nDisinformation\nBackground\n\nYouTube  started  in  2005  as  a  video-sharing  website  and  quickly  evolved  into  one  of  the  world\u2019s  most  vibrant \nonline communities. Thousands, then millions, then billions of people connected through content that educated, \nexcited, or inspired them. YouTube is one of the world\u2019s largest exporters of online cultural and learning content \nand is a significant driver of economic activity, providing many of its creators with the ability to make a livelihood \nby using its services. \n\nDisinformation is not unique to YouTube. It is a global problem afflicting many platforms and publishers. When a \nplatform fosters openness, as we do at YouTube, there\u2019s a risk that unreliable information will be presented. While \ndisinformation has been a problem as long as there\u2019s been news to report, the Internet has made it possible for \ndisinformation to spread further and faster than ever before. We take our responsibility to combat disinformation \nin this domain seriously. To be effective at our size, we invest in a combination of technological solutions with a \nlarge and growing base of human talent. Technology provides scale and speed, while human talent provides the \ncontextual knowledge needed to fine-tune and improve our systems every step of the way.\n\nYouTube  has  developed  a  comprehensive  approach  to  tackling  controversial  content  on  our  platform.  \nThis approach is guided by three principles:\n\n1.  Keep content on the platform unless it is in violation of our Community Guidelines\n\n2.  Set a high bar for recommendations\n\n3.  Monetization is a privilege\n\nFrom  these  principles,  we  create  robust  systems  to  responsibly  manage  all  types  of  controversial  content, \nincluding disinformation. \n\nGiven  how  broad  the  spectrum  of  disinformation  is,  we  implement  the  three  product  strategies  mentioned \nin  our  opening  section  in  ways  that  are  relevant  to  YouTube\u2019s  specific  products,  community,  and  challenges: \n\n\u2022  Make Quality Count\n\n\u2022  We deploy effective product and ranking systems that demote low-quality disinformation and elevate \n\nmore authoritative content\n\n\u2022  Counteract Malicious Actors \n\n\u2022  We rigorously develop and enforce our content policies\n\n\u2022  We protect the integrity of information tied to elections through effective ranking algorithms, and tough \n\npolicies against users that misrepresent themselves or who engage in other deceptive practices \n\n\u2022  We remove monetary incentives through heightened standards for accounts that seek to utilize any of \n\nYouTube\u2019s monetization products\n\n\u2022  Give Users Context\n\n\u2022  We provide context to users via information panels on YouTube \n\n17\n\n\n--- Page 19 ---\n\nWe take our responsibilities as a platform seriously. We believe a responsible YouTube will continue to embrace \nthe democratization of access to information while providing a reliable and trustworthy service to our users.\n\nTackling disinformation on YouTube\n\nGiven  the  spectrum  of  content  and  intent,  it  is  necessary  to  have  a  nuanced  approach  that  strikes  the  right \nbalance between managing our users\u2019 expectations to express themselves freely on the platform with the need to \npreserve the health of the broader community of the creator, user, and advertiser ecosystem. Let\u2019s take a closer \nlook at the three guiding principles on which we base our approach for YouTube:\n\n1.  Keep content on the platform unless it is in violation  \n\nof our Community Guidelines\n\nYouTube\u2019s  Community  Guidelines25  prohibit  certain  categories  of  material,  including  sexually  explicit  content, \nspam, hate speech, harassment and incitement to violence. We aim to balance free expression with preventing \nharmful  content in order to maintain a vibrant community.  Striking this balance is never easy, especially for  a \nglobal platform. YouTube has always had Community Guidelines, but we revise them as user behavior changes \nand as the world evolves. \n\nYouTube also maintains a more detailed and living set of enforcement guidelines that provide internal guidance on \nthe enforcement of the public Community Guidelines. These enforcement guidelines are extensive and dynamic \nto ensure that the policies apply to changing trends and new patterns of controversial content online. YouTube \ndoes not typically disclose these updates to the public because doing so would make it easier for unscrupulous \nusers to evade detection. \n\nTo help formulate rules that are consistent, unbiased, well-informed, and broad enough to apply to a wide scope \nof  content,  YouTube  often  relies  on  external  subject  matter  experts  and  NGOs  to  consult  on  various  issues. \nYouTube  has  also  worked  with  independent  experts  as  a  member  of  the  Global  Network  Initiative  (GNI),26  to \nestablish  key  principles  to  guide  content  review  efforts  and  systems,  including  notifying  users  if  a  video  is \nremoved and allowing for appeals. To honor YouTube\u2019s commitment to human rights, we also make exceptions \nto the Community Guidelines for material that is educational, documentary, scientific, and/or artistic.\n\nConsistent enforcement\nWith  hundreds  of  hours  of  new  content  uploaded  to  YouTube  every  minute,  clear  policies  and  enforcement \nguidelines are only part of what matters. To maintain a site where abuse is minimized, the systems used to curtail \nabuse must scale. YouTube has always relied on a mix of humans and technology to enforce its guidelines and \nwill continue to do so. \n\nYouTube has thousands of reviewers who operate 24/7 to address content that may violate our policies and the \nteam  is  constantly  expanding  to  meet  evolving  enforcement  needs.  Our  review  teams  are  diverse  and  global. \nLinguistic  and  cultural  knowledge  is  needed  to  interpret  the  context  of  a  flagged  video  and  decide  whether  it \nviolates our guidelines. Reviewers go through a comprehensive training program to ensure that they have a full \nunderstanding  of  YouTube\u2019s  Community  Guidelines.  We  use  frequent  tests  as  part  of  the  training  process  to \nensure quality and knowledge retention. Human reviewers are essential to evaluating context and to ensuring that \neducational, documentary, scientific, and artistic content is protected.\n\n18\n\nHow Google Fights Disinformation\n\n\n--- Page 20 ---\n\nWe strive to be as transparent \nas  possible  when  it  comes \nto  actions  we \ntake  on \ncontent  on  our  platform. \nis  why  we  release \nThat \na  Community  Guidelines \nEnforcement Report27 where \nwe give insight into the scale \nand  nature  of  our  extensive \npolicy  enforcement  efforts. \nIt  shows \nthat  YouTube\u2019s \n\u2018crime  rate\u2019  is  low  \u2013  only  a \nfraction  of  YouTube\u2019s  total \nviews  are  on  videos  that \nviolate company policies.\n\nYouTube flagging and review decisions continuously improves our systems\n\nApplication to disinformation\nThere are several policies in the Community Guidelines that are directly applicable in some form to disinformation. \nThese include policies against spam, deceptive practices, scams,28 impersonation,29 hate,30 and harassment.31\n\nThe  policy  against  spam,  deceptive  practices,  and  scams  prohibits  posting  large  amounts  of  untargeted, \nunwanted,  or  repetitive  content  in  videos,  comments,  private  messages,  especially  if  the  main  purpose  of  the \ncontent is to drive people off to another site. Similarly, activity that seeks to artificially increase the number of \nviews, likes, dislikes, comments, or other metrics either through the use of automated systems or by serving up \nvideos to unsuspecting viewers is against our terms. Additionally, content that exists solely to incentivize viewers \nfor engagement (views, likes, comments, etc.), or by coordinating at scale with other users to drive up views for \nthe primary purpose of interfering with our systems, is prohibited. \n\nOne of the abuses this policy covers is content that deliberately seeks to spread disinformation that could suppress \nvoting or otherwise interfere with democratic or civic processes. For example, demonstrably false content that \nclaims one demographic votes on one day while another votes on a separate day would be in violation of our \npolicies. \n\nAnother applicable policy regards impersonation. Accounts seeking to spread disinformation by misrepresenting \nwho they are via impersonation are clearly against our policies and the account will be removed. For example, if \na user copies a channel\u2019s profile, background, or text, and writes comments to make it look like somebody else\u2019s \nchannel posted the comments, we remove the channel. Impersonation can also occur if a user creates a channel \nor video using another individual\u2019s real name, image, or other personal information to deceive people into thinking \nthey are someone else on YouTube. \n\nYouTube has clear policies against hate and harassment. Hate speech refers to content that promotes violence \nagainst, or has the primary purpose of inciting hatred against, individuals or groups based on certain attributes, \nsuch as race or ethnic origin, religion, disability, gender, age, veteran status, or sexual orientation/gender identity. \nHarassment  may  include  abusive  videos,  comments,  messages,  revealing  someone\u2019s  personal  information, \nunwanted sexualization, or incitement to harass other users or creators. Users that spread disinformation that \nruns afoul of either our hate or harassment policies will be removed and further appropriate action taken.\n\n19\n\n\n--- Page 21 ---\n\n2.  Set a high bar for recommendations\n\nOur primary objective when it comes to  our  search  and discovery systems is to  help people find content that \nthey  will  enjoy  watching,  whether  through  their  Homepage,  Watch  Next,  or  Search  results.  We  aim  to  provide \ncontent that lets users dive into topics they care about, broaden their perspective, and connect them to the current \nzeitgeist. When a user is seeking content with high intent \u2013 subscribing to a channel or searching for the video \u2013  \nit  is  our  responsibility  to  help  users  find  and  watch  the  video.  On  the  other  hand,  in  the  absence  of  strong  or \nspecific intent for a particular video, we believe it is our responsibility to not proactively recommend content that \nmay be deemed low quality.\n\nHow our approach to recommendations has evolved\nWhen YouTube\u2019s recommendation systems first launched, it sought to optimize for content that got users to click. \nWe noticed that this system incentivized creators to publish misleading and sensationalist clickbait, and users \nwould click on the video but very quickly realize the content was not something they liked. The system was failing \nto meet our user-centric goals. \n\nTo  provide  a  better  service  for  our  users,  we  began  to  look  at  the  amount  of  time  a  video  was  watched,  and \nwhether it was watched to completion, rather than just whether it was clicked. Additionally, we began to demote \nclickbait. We realized that watchtime was a better signal to determine whether the content we were surfacing to \nusers was connecting them to engaging content they\u2019d enjoy watching. But we learned that just because a user \nmight be watching content longer does not mean that they are having a positive experience. So we introduced \nsurveys to ask users if they were satisfied with particular recommendations. With this direct feedback, we started \nfine-tuning and improving these systems based on this high-fidelity notion of satisfaction. \n\nThe efforts to improve YouTube\u2019s recommendation systems did not end there. We set out to prevent our systems \nfrom serving up content that could misinform users in a harmful way, particularly in domains that rely on veracity, \nsuch as science, medicine, news, or historical events. \n\nTo that end, we introduced a higher bar for videos that are promoted through the YouTube homepage or that are \nsurfaced to users through the \u201cwatch next\u201d recommendations. Just because content is available on the site, it \ndoes not mean that it will display as prominently throughout the recommendation engine. \n\nAs  has  been  mentioned  previously,  our  business  depends  on  the  trust  users  place  in  our  services  to  provide \nreliable, high-quality information. The primary goal of our recommendation systems today is to create a trusted \nand positive experience for our users. Ensuring these recommendation systems less frequently provide fringe or \nlow-quality disinformation content is a top priority for the company. The YouTube company-wide goal is framed \nnot just as \u201cGrowth\u201d, but as \u201cResponsible Growth\u201d.\n\n20\n\nHow Google Fights Disinformation\n\n\n--- Page 22 ---\n\nBeyond  removal  of  content  that  violates  our  community  guidelines,  our  teams  have  three  explicit  tactics  \nto support responsible content consumption. They are: \n\n\u2022  Where possible and relevant, elevate authoritative content from trusted sources. In areas such as music \nor entertainment, relevance, newness, or popularity might be better signals to tilt our systems to achieve \nthe user\u2019s desired intent and connect them to quality content they\u2019d enjoy. But as we describe in our Search \nsection, in verticals where veracity and credibility are key, including news, politics, medical, and scientific \ndomains,  we  work  hard  to  ensure  our  search  and  recommendation  systems  provide  content  from  more \nauthoritative sources.\n\n\u2022  Provide users with more context (often text-based information) to make them more informed users on \nthe content they consume. On certain types of content, including content produced by organizations that \nreceive state or public funding or topical content that tends to be accompanied by disinformation online, \nwe have started to provide information panels that contain additional contextual information and links to \nauthoritative third-party sites so that our users can make educated decisions about the content they watch \non our platform.\n\n\u2022  Reduce  recommendations  of  low-quality  content.  We  aim  to  design  a  system  that  recommends \nquality  content  while  less  frequently  recommending  content  that  may  be  close  to  the  line  created  by \nour  Community  Guidelines,  content  that  could  misinform  users  in  harmful  ways,  or  low-quality  content \nthat  may  result  in  a  poor  experience  for  our  users,  like  clickbait.  For  example,  content  that  claims  that \nthe  Earth  is  flat  or  promises  a  \u201cmiracle  cure\u201d  for  a  serious  disease  might  not  necessarily  violate  our \nCommunity  Guidelines,  but  we  don\u2019t  want  to  proactively  recommend  it  to  users.  Our  incentives  are  to  \nget this right for our users, so we use everyday people as evaluators to provide input on what constitutes \ndisinformation or borderline content under our policies, which in turn informs our ranking systems.\n\nCase Study: Applying Our Principles to YouTube News & Politics\n\nDisinformation in news and politics is a priority given its importance to society and the outsized impact \ndisinformation can have during fast-moving news events. Although news content only generates a small \nfraction of overall YouTube watchtime, it\u2019s a specific use case that is especially important to us. \n\nIn July 2018, YouTube announced product and partnership tactics that directly apply our guiding content \nmanagement principles to news.32\n\nThe  first  solution  included  making  authoritative  sources  readily  available.  To  help  meet  this  goal,  we \ncreated a system to elevate authoritative sources for people coming to YouTube for news and politics. \nFor example, if a user is watching content from  a trusted news source, the \u201cwatch next\u201d panel should \nsimilarly display content from other trusted news sources. Assumed within this principle is the demotion \nof disinformation content that we outlined earlier. \n\nThe team has also built and launched two cornerstone products \u2013 the Top News shelf and the Breaking \nNews shelf \u2013 to prominently display authoritative political news information. The Top News shelf triggers \nin response to search queries that have political news-seeking intent, and provides content from verified \nnews channels. These systems rely on a variety of signals that are derived from Google News and from \nour internal systems when a user might be seeking information on a given topic.\n\n21\n\n\n--- Page 23 ---\n\nThe Breaking News shelf triggers on \nthe YouTube homepage automatically \nwhen there is a significant news event \nhappening in a specific country. \n\nSimilar  to  the  Top  News  shelf,  only \ncontent  from  authoritative  sources \nis  eligible  to  be  displayed  in  the \nBreaking News shelf. \n\nMore  recently,  YouTube  has  been \ndeveloping  products \nthat  directly \naddress a core vulnerability involving \nthe  spread  of  disinformation  in  the \nimmediate  aftermath  of  a  breaking \nnews  event.  After  a  breaking \nnews  event,  it  takes  some  time  for \njournalists  to  create  authoritative \nfact-based video content and upload \nit  to  YouTube,  while  unscrupulous \nuploaders  can  more  quickly  upload \nbizarre conspiracy theories.\n\nTop News Shelf on YouTube Search\n\nBreaking News Shelf on YouTube Home\n\nIn  these  events,  YouTube\u2019s  systems  historically  delivered  the  most \nrelevant content that matched the typed query, and without appropriate \nguardrails would display content from these users seeking to exploit \nthis vulnerability.\n\nThe  first  step  toward  a  resolution  involved  creating  systems  that \ndetermine  when  a  breaking  news  event  might  be  happening,  which \ntilts  results  tied  to  that  event  toward  authority  and  away  from  strict \nrelevance,  popularity,  or  recency.  This  helped  display  content  from \ncredible sources. \n\nFurthermore,  while  authoritative  video  content  takes  time,  credible \ntext-based  reporting  is  much  quicker.  As  a  result,  YouTube  launched \na  product  that  displays  an  information  panel  providing  text-based \nbreaking  news  content  from  an  authoritative  news  source  while  a \nsignificant news event is developing. The information panel also links \ndirectly to the article\u2019s website so that viewers can easily access and \nread the full article about the news event.\n\nInformation Panel Providing Breaking News Context \n\nOnce a critical mass of authoritative news videos has been published \non the topic, Breaking News and Top News shelves begin to take over \nas the primary news consumption experiences on the platform. \n\n22\n\nHow Google Fights Disinformation\n\n\n--- Page 24 ---\n\nThe  second  solution  focuses  on  providing  context  to  help  people \nmake their own decisions. There are certain instances where YouTube \nprovides  viewers  with  additional  information  to  help  them  better \nunderstand the sources of news content they watch. For example, if a \nchannel is owned by a news publisher that is funded by a government, \nor is otherwise publicly funded, an information panel providing publisher \ncontext  is  displayed  on  the  watch  page  of  the  channel\u2019s  videos.  This \ninformation panel indicates how the publisher is funded and provides a \nlink to the publisher\u2019s Wikipedia page. \n\nAnother information panel product that was launched in 2018 aims to \nprovide  additional  factual  information  from  outside  sources  around \ntopics that tend to be accompanied by disinformation online, particularly \non  YouTube.  Users  may  see  panels  alongside  videos  on  topics  such \nas \u201cmoon landing hoax\u201d that link to information from credible sources, \nincluding Encyclopedia Britannica and Wikipedia. \n\nInformation Panel Providing Publisher Context\n\nAn  information  panel  providing  topical  context  may  appear  in  Search \nresults or on the watch page of videos. It will include basic, independent \ninformation about a given topic and will link to a third-party website to \nallow viewers to learn more about the topic. This information panel appears alongside all videos related \nto the topic, regardless of the opinions or perspectives expressed in the videos. Information panels do not \naffect any video features or monetization eligibility.\n\nThe third solution involves supporting \nthat \njournalism  with \nallows news to thrive.\n\ntechnology \n\nThese \nissues \nimportant  societal \ngo  beyond  any  single  platform \nand  involve  shared  values  across \nour  society.  The  fight  against \ndisinformation is only as good as the \nquality of news information available \nin  the  ecosystem,  and  are  intent  on \ndoing our part to support the industry \nif we are to truly address the broader \nproblem  of  disinformation.  We \nbelieve  quality  journalism  requires \nsustainable  revenue  streams  and \nthat  we  have  a  responsibility  to \nsupport  innovation  in  products  and \nfunding for news.\n\nInformation Panel Providing Topical Context on YouTube Search and Watch Pages\n\nSeveral years ago, YouTube developed a solution in partnership with key publishers to help newsrooms \nimprove and maximize their video capabilities. The program is called Player for Publishers, and it allows \npublishers  to  use  YouTube  to  power  the  videos  on  their  sites  and  applications.  The  program  is  free   \nand 100% of the advertising revenue for ads sold by the publisher and served on their own properties goes \nto the publisher. \n\n23\n\n\n--- Page 25 ---\n\nsustainable \n\nin  building \n\nIn  addition,  last  year,  YouTube  committed  $25M \nin  funding,  as  part  of  a  broader  $300M  investment \nby  the  Google  News  Initiative,33  to  support  news \norganizations \nvideo \noperations. YouTube announced34 the winners of our \nfirst ever innovation funding program. These partners \nhail from 23 countries across the Americas, Europe, \nAfrica,  and  Asia-Pacific,  representing  a  diverse \nmix  of  broadcasters,  traditional  publishers,  digital \npublishers, news agencies, local media, and creators. \nBest practices gained from this program will be shared publicly via case studies, providing all newsrooms \nthe opportunity to learn and apply insights as we work together to support the development of long-term, \nsustainable news video businesses. \n\nPlayer for Publishers\n\nIn conjunction with this investment, YouTube created a news working group \u2013 a quarterly convening of \nnews  industry  leaders  with  whom  we  are  collaborating  to  shape  the  future  of  news  on  YouTube.  The \nnews working group consists of top broadcasters, publishers, creators, and academics around the world \nand they have been providing feedback on items such as how to better quantify authoritativeness, what \nadditional types of information might be useful to provide to users in our information panel projects, and \nwhat more we can do to support online video operations in newsrooms. Given how complex these issues \nare, we know we can\u2019t work in a silo. We must partner with industry and civil society to come together \naround solutions that work.\n\n3.  We view monetization on our platform as a privilege\n\nMany people use YouTube simply to share their content with the world. Creators who meet the eligibility criteria \ncan  apply to join the YouTube Partner Program, which makes their videos eligible to run advertising and earn \nmoney through Google\u2019s advertising products. Monetizing creators must comply with advertiser-friendly content \nguidelines. Advertising will be disabled from running on videos that violate these policies. \n\nOver  the  last  few  years,  YouTube  and  Google\u2019s  advertising  products  have  taken  steps  to  strengthen  the \nrequirements for monetization so that spammers, impersonators, and other bad actors can\u2019t hurt the ecosystem \nor  take  advantage  of  good  creators.  To  apply  for \nmembership  in  the  YouTube  Partner  Program, \nthe  thresholds  were  increased  for  channels  to  be \ndeemed  eligible.  Channels  must  have  generated \n4,000 watch hours in the previous 12 months and \nhave more than 1,000 subscribers. \n\nFollowing  application,  YouTube\u2019s  review  team \nensures \nthe  channel  has  not  run  afoul  of \nmonetization, content, and copyright policies prior \nto  admitting  them  to  the  program.  Only  creators \nwith sufficient history and demonstrated advertiser \nsafety will receive access to ads and other monetization products. In changing these thresholds, YouTube has \nsignificantly improved the protections in place against impersonating creators.\n\nProcess for Admittance to YouTube Partner Program\n\nMore information on how Google protects its monetization services from abuse is discussed in the next section, \n\u201cGoogle Ads & Disinformation\u201d.\n\n24\n\nHow Google Fights Disinformation\n\n\n--- Page 26 ---\n\nGoogle Advertising  \nProducts & Disinformation\nBackground\n\nGoogle provides multiple products to help content creators \u2013 website builders, video makers, and app developers \n\u2013  make  money  from  doing  what  they  love.  Our  advertising  products  enable  creators  to  place  ads  within  the \ncontent they make and manage the process by which they sell space in that content. In addition, we have products \nfor advertisers to purchase that inventory across various content creators.\n\nGoogle  Ads  and  DV  360  help  businesses of  all  sizes  get  their  messages  to  the  audiences  they  need  to  grow. \nThese services are \u201cfront doors\u201d for advertisers of all sizes to buy ads across Google\u2019s monetization products \nand platforms \u2013 connecting them with billions of people finding answers on Search, watching videos on YouTube, \nexploring new places on Google Maps, discovering apps on Google Play, and more. \n\nAdSense, AdMob, and Ad Manager, support content creators\u2019 and publishers\u2019 efforts to create and distribute their \ncreations. We launched AdSense in 2003 to help publishers fund their content by placing relevant ads on their \nwebsite. Over time, it has become a core part of our advertising products, serving more than 2 million website \nowners around the world.\n\nOur  ads  and  monetization  products  enable  businesses  of  all  sizes  from  around  the  world  to  promote  a  wide \nvariety of products, services, applications, and websites on Google and across our partner sites and apps, making \nit possible for Internet users to discover more content they care about.\n\nWe  also  understand  that  the  content  of  both  ads  and  publisher  sites  needs  to  be  safe  and  provide  a  positive \nexperience for users. We aim to protect users and ensure a positive ad experience across our partner sites and \napps as well as owned and operated properties like Maps and Gmail, by creating clear policies that govern what \ncontent can and cannot be monetized. When we create these policies, we think about our values and culture as \na company, as well as operational, technical, and business considerations. We regularly review changes in online \ntrends and practices, industry norms, and regulations to keep our policies up-to-date. And, we listen to our users\u2019 \nfeedback and concerns about the types of ads they see. \n\nAs we create new policies and update existing ones, we strive to ensure a safe and positive experience for our \nusers.  We  also  consider  the  impact  that  certain  kinds  of  content  will  have  on  our  advertisers  and  publishers. \nFor example, some advertisers do not want their ads shown next to particular types of publisher content, and  \nvice versa. \n\nAt the same time, we are mindful that the advertisers and publishers who use our services represent a broad \nrange of experiences and viewpoints and we don\u2019t want to be in the position of limiting those viewpoints or their \nability to reach new audiences. \n\nOftentimes, these goals are in tension with one another. We aim for a balanced approach that prevents harm to \nour users by putting limits on the types of content we allow to be monetized without being overly restrictive, while \nalso creating clear, enforceable, and predictable policies for advertisers and publishers. \n\nWe have a responsibility to balance the imperatives of making sure we leave room for a variety of opinions to be \nexpressed, while preventing harmful or misrepresentative content on our advertising platforms. \n\n25\n\n\n--- Page 27 ---\n\nTackling disinformation on Google\u2019s  \nadvertising products \n\nThe considerations described above influence the policies we create for advertisers and publishers, and those \npolicies are the primary way by which our advertising platforms implement the strategies to counter disinformation \nthat we mention in the opening section of this paper, including: \n\n\u2022  Counteract Malicious Actors\n\n\u2022  We look for, and take action against, attempts to circumvent our policies.\n\n\u2022  Give Users More Context\n\n\u2022  \u201cWhy this ad\u201d labels enabling users to understand why they\u2019re presented with a specific ad and how to \nchange their preferences so as to alter the personalization of the ads they are shown, or to opt out of \npersonalized ads altogether.\n\n\u2022  In-ad disclosures and transparency reports on election advertising, which are rolling out during elections \n\nin the U.S., Europe, and India as our starting point.\n\nGoogle\u2019s  policies  to  tackle  disinformation  on  our  advertising  platforms  favor  an  approach  that  focuses  on \nmisrepresentative or harmful behavior by advertisers or publishers while avoiding judgments on the veracity of \nstatements made about politics or current events. To that end, we have developed a number of policies designed \nto catch bad behaviors, including many that can be associated with disinformation campaigns.\n\nWhile we do not classify content specifically as \u201cdisinformation\u201d, we do have a number of long-standing content \npolicies aimed at preventing deceptive or low-quality content on our platforms. These policies complement, and \nbuild on, the strategies we outline in the opening section of this paper.\n\nEach  of  these  policies  reflect  a  behavior-based  approach  to  fighting  deceptive  content.  Rather  than  make  a \njudgment on specific claims, we enforce policies against advertiser and publisher behavior that is associated \nwith misrepresentative or harmful content. \n\nThe policies described in this document are current as of the publication of this paper but are also subject to \ncontinual refinement and improvement to take into account emerging trends and threats to ensure the integrity of \nour platforms and the information we are providing to partners and users.\n\nManaging \u201cscraped\u201d or unoriginal content\n\nIn order to ensure a good experience for users and advertisers, we have policies for publishers that limit or disable \nad serving on pages with little to no value and/or excessive advertising.35 This results in a significant number of \npolicy violations. In 2017, we blocked over 12,000 websites for \u201cscraping,\u201d duplicating and copying content from \nother sites, up from 10,000 in 2016.36 \n\nAlso,  Google  Ads  does  not  allow  advertisements  that  point  users  to  landing  pages  with  insufficient  original \ncontent. This includes content that is replicated from another source without providing any additional value in \nthe form of added content or functionality. For example, a site that consists of news articles that are scraped \nfrom other sources without adding additional commentary or value to the user would not be allowed to advertise  \nwith us.37\n\n26\n\nHow Google Fights Disinformation\n\n\n--- Page 28 ---\n\nMisrepresentation\n\nWe have long prevented ads that intend to deceive users by excluding relevant information or giving misleading \ninformation about products, services, or businesses. This includes making false statements about the advertiser\u2019s \nidentity or qualifications, or making false claims that entice a user with an improbable result. \n\nOur  policies  on  misrepresentation  were  extended  to  content  that  is  available  via  our  monetization  products \n(AdSense, AdMob, and Ad Manager) in 2016, and are publicly available online.38\n\nWe made an additional update to our Google Ads and AdSense policies in 2018 to specifically state that it\u2019s not \nacceptable to direct content about politics, social issues, or matters of public concern to users in a country other \nthan your own, if you misrepresent or conceal your country of origin or other material details about yourself or \nyour organization. \n\nInappropriate content\n\nWe also have long-standing policies to disallow monetization of shocking, dangerous, or inappropriate content \non our advertising platforms, the details of which are publicly available online.39 This includes derogatory content, \nshocking or violent content, or ads that lack reasonable sensitivity toward a tragic event.\n\nPolitical influence operations \n\nAs  discussed  in  a  blog  post  in  August  2018,  we  have  also  conducted  investigations  into  foreign  influence \noperations on our advertising platforms.40 To complement the work of our internal teams, we engage independent \ncybersecurity experts and top security consultants to provide us with intelligence on these operations. Actors \nengaged in these types of influence operations violate our policies and we swiftly remove such content from our \nservices and terminate these actors\u2019 accounts. \n\nElection integrity\n\nWhen it comes to elections, we recognize that it is critical to support democratic processes by helping users get \nimportant voting information, including insights into who is responsible for the political advertising content they \nsee on our platforms. \n\nBeginning  with  the  2018  U.S.  Congressional  midterm  election,  we  require  additional  verification  for  anyone \nwho  wants  to  purchase  an  election  ad  on  Google  in  the  U.S.,  and  require  that  advertisers  confirm  they  are  a \nU.S.  citizen  or  lawful  permanent  resident.41  In  an  effort  to  provide  transparency  around  who  is  paying  for  an \nelection ad, we also require that ad creatives incorporate a clear disclosure of who is paying for it. Additionally, \nwe released a Transparency Report specifically focused on election ads.42 This Report describes who  is  buying  \nelection-related   ads   on   our   platforms   and   how   much   money   is  being  spent.  We  have  also  built  a  searchable \nlibrary  for  election  ads  where  anyone  can  find  election  ads  purchased  on  Google  and  who  paid  for  them.43  \nIn  parallel,  we  updated  our  personalized  ads  policies  to  require  verification  for  all  advertisers  who  use  our \nlimited  political  affiliation  options  to  target  ads  to  users  or  to  promote  advertisers\u2019  products  and  services \nin the United States.44\n\n27\n\n\n--- Page 29 ---\n\nAs  we  look  ahead  to  2019,  we  are  also \nplanning  to  extend  these  election  integrity \nefforts to other elections around the globe. \nSimilar  to  our  approach  for  U.S.  federal \nelections,  we  will  be  requiring  verification \nand  disclosure  for  election  ads  in  the \nEuropean  Union  Parliamentary  elections45 \nIndian  Lok  Sabha  election.46  \nand  the \nthat  mention  a  political  party, \nAds \ncandidate,  or  current  office  holder  will \nbe  verified  by  Google  and  be  required  to \ndisclose to voters who is paying for the ad. \nWe will also be introducing respective Political Ads Transparency Reports and searchable ad libraries for each of \nthese elections that will provide more information about who is purchasing election ads, who is being targeted, \nand how much money is being spent.\n\nThe new political advertising section in our Transparency Report shows how much \n\nmoney is spent across states and congressional districts for U.S. federal elections\n\nIn  addition  to  these  specific  efforts,  we\u2019re \nthinking  hard  about  elections  and  how  we \ncontinue to support democratic processes \naround  the  world,  including  by  bringing \nmore  transparency  to  political  advertising \nonline, by helping connect people to useful \nand  relevant  election-related  information, \nand  by  working \nto  protect  election \ninformation  online.  We  will  continue  to \ninvest  in  initiatives  that  build  further  on  \nour commitment to election transparency.\n\nConsistent Enforcement\n\nThe political advertising section in our U.S. Transparency Report also shows which ads had the highest \n\nviews, the latest election ads running on our platform, and explores specific advertisers\u2019 campaigns\n\nOur enforcement teams use a variety of robust methods to ensure content on our advertising platforms adheres \nto our policies, including machine learning, human review, and other technological methods. This approach is very \nsimilar to the one used by YouTube and described earlier in this paper. We have always relied on a combination of \nhumans and technology to enforce our policies and will continue to do so. \n\nWhen  we  find  policy  violations  we  take  action  to  enforce  our  policies.  Depending  on  the  policy  violation,  this \ncan include blocking a particular ad from appearing and removing ads from a publisher page or site. In cases of \nrepeated or egregious violations, we may disable an account altogether.47/48  Every year we publish a report on our \nefforts to remove bad actors from our advertising ecosystem.49\n\nWe also know that some content, even if it complies with our policies, may not be something that all advertisers \nwant  to  be  associated  with.  That\u2019s  why,  in  addition  to  these  policies,  we  provide  advertisers  with  additional \ncontrols, and help them exclude certain types of content that, while in compliance with our policies, may not fit \ntheir brand or business. These controls let advertisers exclude certain types of content or terms from their video, \ndisplay and search advertising campaigns. Advertisers can exclude whole categories of content such as politics, \nnews, sports, beauty, fashion, and many others. Similarly, publishers can also review and block certain ads from \nshowing on their pages, including by specific advertiser URL, general ad category like \u201capparel\u201d or \u201cvehicles\u201d, and \nsensitive ad category like \u201creligion\u201d or \u201cpolitics\u201d. \n\n28\n\nHow Google Fights Disinformation\n\n\n--- Page 30 ---\n\nConclusion\n\nTackling  the  propagation  of  false  or  misleading  information  is  core  to  Google\u2019s  mission  and  to  ensuring  our \nproducts remain useful to the billions of users and partners who utilize our services every day. While we have \nalways fought against malicious actors\u2019 efforts to manipulate our systems and deceive our users, it\u2019s never been \nmore important to thwart them and to ensure we provide our users with information worthy of the trust they have \nin our services. \n\nAs we have outlined in this paper, this is not a straightforward endeavor. Disinformation and misinformation can \ntake many shapes, manifest differently in different products, and raise significant challenges when it comes to \nbalancing risks of harm to good faith, free expression, with the imperative to serve users with information they \ncan trust. \n\nWe  believe  that  we\u2019re  at  our  best  when  we  improve  our  products  so  they  continue  to  make  quality  count,  to \ncounteract  malicious  actors,  and  to  give  users  context,  as  well  as  working  beyond  our  products  to  support  a \nhealthy journalistic ecosystem, partner with civil society and researchers, and stay one step ahead of future risks. \n\nWe  are  constantly  striving  to  make  progress  on  these  issues. This  is  by  no  means  a  solved  problem,  and  we \nknow  that  we  have  room  to  make  progress.  We  welcome  a  constructive  dialogue  with  governments,  civil \nsociety, academia, and newsrooms on what more can be done to address the challenges of misinformation and \ndisinformation and hope that this paper will be useful in sparking these conversations. \n\n29\n\n\n--- Page 31 ---\n\nhttps://www.poynter.org/channels/fact-checking \n\n34  \n\nhttps://youtube.googleblog.com/2018/07/building-\n\nReferences\n\n1  \n\nhttps://europe.googleblog.com/2015/10/\n\nintroducing-accelerated-mobile-pages.html \n\n2  \n\nhttps://www.blog.google/outreach-initiatives/google-news-\n\ninitiative/digital-news-initiative-introducing/\n\nhttps://g.co/newsinitiative\n\nhttps://blog.google/topics/google-news-initiative/\n\nintroducing-subscribe-google/\n\nhttps://jigsaw.google.com/ \n\nhttps://www.blog.google/technology/safety-security/\n\nupdate-state-sponsored-activity/ \n\nhttps://protectyourelection.withgoogle.com/\n\nhttps://projectshield.withgoogle.com/\n\n3  \n\n4  \n\n5  \n\n6  \n\n7  \n\n8  \n\n9  \n\n10  \n\nhttps://transparencyreport.google.com/political-ad \n\n11  \n\nhttps://www.blog.google/around-the-globe/google-europe/\n\nsupporting-european-union-parliamentary-elections/ \n\n12  \n\nhttps://india.googleblog.com/2019/01/bringing-\n\nmore-transparency-to-indian.html \n\n13  \n\nOn January 31st 2019, we have made a dataset of synthetic speech available \n\nto all participants in the third-party and independent 2019 ASVspoof challenge, \n\nwhich invites researchers from all around the world to test countermeasures \n\n30  \n\nhttps://support.google.com/youtube/\n\nanswer/2801939?hl=en&ref_topic=2803176 \n\n31  \n\nhttps://support.google.com/youtube/\n\nanswer/2802268?hl=en&ref_topic=2803176 \n\n32  \n\nhttps://youtube.googleblog.com/2018/07/building-\n\nbetter-news-experience-on.html\n\n33  \n\nhttps://newsinitiative.withgoogle.com/ \n\nbetter-news-experience-on.html \n\n35  \n\nRead more: https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/1346295?hl=en\n\n36  \n\nRead more: https://support.google.com/adsense/\n\nanswer/1348737?hl=en&ref_topic=1261918\n\n37  \n\nRead more: https://support.google.com/adspolicy/\n\nanswer/6368661?hl=en&ref_topic=1626336\n\n38  \n\nGoogle Ads Misrepresentation Policy: https://support.google.com/\n\nadspolicy/answer/6020955 - AdSense misrepresentative content policy: \n\nhttps://support.google.com/adsense/answer/1348688 \n\n39  \n\nGoogle Ads Dangerous or Derogatory Policy: https://support.google.com/\n\nadspolicy/answer/6015406; AdSense Dangerous or Derogatory Policy: https://\n\nsupport.google.com/adsense/answer/1348688?hl=en&rd=1#Dangerous_or_\n\nderogatory_content; AdSense Shocking Content policy: https://support.google.\n\ncom/adsense/answer/1348688?hl=en&rd=1#Shocking_content\n\nagainst fake (or \u2018spoofed\u2019) speech.

Given the changes that have occurred\nsince May 2019, it would be good to arrange a teleconference to speak with you in\nthe next week.\n\nCan you please also confirm the AEC\u2019s point of contact at Twitter, if the AEC identifies\nany communications on your platform that breach the Electoral Act.

Main Content from FOI Request Documents\n\nThe documents reveal ongoing collaboration and communication between the AEC (specifically its Electoral Integrity Assurance Taskforce - EIAT) and major social media platforms concerning electoral integrity, misinformation, and compliance with Australian electoral law, particularly in anticipation of the 2022 Federal Election.\n\n**Key Themes and Content:**\n\n*   **Collaboration and Engagement:**\n    *   The AEC proactively initiated engagement with platforms post-2019 election to prepare for the upcoming 2022 Federal Election, focusing on mutual understanding and collaboration.\n    *   Meetings and teleconferences were scheduled and held with TikTok, Google, and Twitter to discuss policies, electoral interference, and establish communication channels.\n    *   The AEC's Deputy Electoral Commissioner, Jeff Pope, highlights the role of the Electoral Integrity Assurance Taskforce (EIAT) as a cross-Government cooperation.\n\n*   **TikTok's Initiatives:**\n    *   TikTok proposed creating an in-app 'Election Hub' for Australian users, similar to one used for the US Presidential election. This hub would provide links to the AEC's website for official information (registration, how/when/where to vote) and sought permission to use the AEC logo to signify reliability.\n    *   TikTok mentioned engaging in election preparation, including establishing escalation channels, dedicated Trust & Safety (TnS) resources, and Public Service Announcements (PSAs).\n\n*   **Google's Policies and Transparency:**\n    *   Google outlined its \"Political Advertising Transparency Program,\" emphasizing advertiser compliance with local laws (e.g., election silence periods) and disclaimer requirements.\n    *   Google provides resources for political advertisers (policy links, Digital Garage training, verification requirements, ad disapproval appeals).\n    *   Google introduced transparency reports for political advertising, with Australia's report to launch in 2021, and a searchable library for election ads.\n    *   Google expressed willingness to discuss misinformation and shared its \"How Google Fights Disinformation\" document. This comprehensive document details Google's strategies:\n        *   **Definition:** Deliberate efforts to deceive and mislead using the open web.\n        *   **Three Strategies:** \"Make Quality Count\" (ranking authoritative content), \"Counteract Malicious Actors\" (prohibiting misrepresentation, impersonation, coordinated activity), and \"Give Users More Context\" (Knowledge Panels, fact-check tags, \"Full Coverage\" news features, \"Why this ad\" labels).\n        *   **Specific Actions:** Support for quality journalism (Google News Initiative), protecting elections (combating influence operations, securing accounts/websites, increasing transparency for political ads), and anticipating future risks like synthetic media (\"deep fakes\").\n        *   **Product-Specific Implementation:** Details how these strategies are applied across Google Search, Google News, YouTube (Community Guidelines, elevating authoritative news, information panels for publisher/topical context, stricter monetization policies), and Google Advertising products.\n\n*   **Twitter's Engagement:**\n    *   Twitter confirmed its policy of banning political and electoral advertisements, a change since the 2019 Federal Election.\n    *   The AEC sought a point of contact at Twitter for identifying communications that breach the Electoral Act, especially with urgency closer to polling day.\n    *   Meetings focused on \"escalation and civic integrity policy pieces\" for electoral integrity.\n\n*   **AEC's \"Electoral Communications Escalation Scenarios\" (EIAT Document):**\n    *   This document, shared with platforms, outlines 11 scenarios of problematic electoral communications and the relevant Commonwealth laws or issues they infringe. It serves as a guide for platforms on potential breaches the AEC would raise.\n    *   **Scenarios include:**\n        1.  Paid electoral advertisement without proper authorisation (Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918, Section 321D).\n        2.  Electoral communication misleading voters on how to cast votes (Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918, Section 329).\n        3.  Impersonating a Commonwealth official, entity, or service (Criminal Code Act 1995, Part 7.8 \u2013 Section 150.1).\n        4.  Electoral communication by a foreign person/entity (Foreign Influence Transparency Scheme Act 2018).\n        5.  Foreign interference (Criminal Code Act 1995, Division 92, Part 5.2), noting the policy/operational definitions and the challenges of detection/attribution.\n        6.  Electoral communication containing threats of terrorist action.\n        7.  Anonymous electoral communication (unpaid) without authorisation.\n        8.  Defamatory electoral communication.\n        9.  Electoral communication bringing a Commonwealth agency into disrepute.\n        10. Electoral communication containing hate speech (Human rights, racial vilification, Online Safety Act 2021).\n        11. Other electoral communication not breaching Commonwealth law but breaching Platform policy (e.g., spam, false news like incorrect informal voting information).\n\nOverall, the documents demonstrate the AEC's proactive efforts to collaborate with major social media platforms to safeguard the integrity of Australian federal elections, specifically addressing issues of political advertising transparency, misinformation, disinformation, and compliance with electoral laws.", "model": "gemini-2.5-flash", "generated_at": "2025-06-22T14:43:59.232092", "source_hash": "2dd237674121246f6dfa64a2e46557a2c94020677cb3c37840d71032abd888b4", "raw_response_path": "data/llm_responses/LEX1147__overall__balanced__20250622T144359.json", "output_tokens": 1718, "prompt_tokens": 42469, "total_tokens": 45815, "summary_length": 7962}, "short_index": {"text": "FOI request LEX1147 sought correspondence between the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) and major social media platforms (Meta, Twitter, Google, LinkedIn, ByteDance) from 2019 to 2022, focusing on compliance with the Commonwealth Electoral Act and preparations for the 2022 Federal Election. The retrieved documents, primarily emails and attachments from TikTok, Google, and Twitter, reveal proactive, ongoing collaboration between the AEC's Electoral Integrity Assurance Taskforce (EIAT) and these platforms. Key discussions involved TikTok's proposed in-app Election Hub, Google's political advertising transparency program and extensive anti-disinformation strategies (including \"How Google Fights Disinformation\"), and Twitter's policies, notably its ban on political ads and establishment of direct AEC contacts for breaches.

While certain aspects align with progressive values, others highlight persistent concerns about corporate power, the nuances of civil liberties, and the limits of existing frameworks.\n\n**Social Justice:**\nThe documents show a clear alignment with social justice principles through the explicit targeting of **hate speech** (Scenario 10 in \"Electoral communications escalation scenarios\"). The AEC and platforms like Google and YouTube identify \"vilification\" of individuals or groups, linking it to human rights and racial vilification issues, and noting its potential to influence voters. This proactive stance against hate speech in electoral contexts is a positive step towards ensuring equitable participation and a respectful public discourse, particularly protecting vulnerable communities. Furthermore, TikTok's initiative to create an in-app \"Election Hub\" with verified AEC information, specifically targeting \"young first time voters,\" aligns with progressive efforts to ensure all demographics, especially newer and potentially less informed voters, have access to accurate information for democratic participation.\n\n**Environmental Impact:**\nThese documents do **not** contain any information pertaining to environmental impact, as their scope is strictly limited to electoral communications and platform compliance.\n\n**Wealth Distribution & Corporate Influence:**\nHere, the picture is more mixed.\n*   **Alignment:** A significant alignment with progressive values is **Twitter's policy to ban political and electoral advertisements** since the 2019 Federal Election (Doc 18). This directly addresses concerns about unchecked campaign spending and the disproportionate influence of wealth and corporate power in shaping political narratives through paid media. By eliminating this avenue for financial leverage, Twitter's policy promotes a more organic and potentially equitable public debate, consistent with progressive calls for campaign finance reform. Additionally, the AEC's focus on **transparency regarding paid electoral advertisements** (Scenario 1) and Google's \"Political Advertising Transparency Program\" (Doc 12, 16), which aims to verify advertisers and disclose who is paying for ads, are positive steps towards reducing opaque financial influence in elections. Efforts to counter \"foreign influence\" (Scenarios 4 & 5) also align with progressive concerns about external, often corporate or state-backed, actors undermining democratic sovereignty.\n*   **Deviation/Concerns:** The very nature of this FOI request, detailing extensive collaboration between the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) and tech giants like Meta, Google, Twitter, and TikTok, underscores the **immense corporate power** these platforms wield over public discourse. Governments are compelled to engage with them because these private entities control the modern public square, highlighting a significant concentration of influence over democratic processes. The reliance on \"Platform policy\" (Scenario 11) for moderating content that does not breach Commonwealth law but constitutes \"spam or false news\" (e.g., \"Video on social media promoting informal voting that provides incorrect information\") is a concerning deviation. It indicates a reliance on corporate self-regulation rather than robust public oversight, potentially allowing corporate interests or internal biases to dictate what content is permissible, which can clash with progressive demands for stronger governmental accountability over powerful industries. Google's detailed document, \"How Google Fights Disinformation,\" while touting efforts to support journalism and combat \"spam,\" also reiterates its core ad-based business model, which can inherently create conflicts between profit incentives and the unadulterated dissemination of information.\n\n**Civil Liberties:**\nThe documents present both protections and potential vulnerabilities for civil liberties.\n*   **Alignment:** The AEC and the platforms' shared goal to prevent communications that \"mislead voters on how to cast their votes\" (Scenario 2) or that \"impersonates a Commonwealth official\" (Scenario 3) directly safeguards the fundamental civil liberty of an informed and fair vote. The inclusion of hate speech as an escalatory scenario also contributes to creating an online environment where individuals can participate without fear of vilification, thus enhancing civil liberties for marginalized groups.\n*   **Deviation/Concerns:** The broad focus on combating \"disinformation\" and \"false news\" (e.g., Scenario 11, and Google's extensive \"How Google Fights Disinformation\" brief) raises significant civil liberties concerns regarding **freedom of expression**. While malicious disinformation is harmful, defining and policing it can be subjective and risks inadvertently suppressing legitimate, albeit unpopular, critical, or even satirical, viewpoints. Google's own document admits that \"algorithms cannot determine whether a piece of content on current events is true or false,\" relying instead on \"expertise, authority, and trustworthiness,\" which implicitly favors established narratives and could marginalize dissenting voices. The close **government-corporate partnership in content moderation** outlined through the \"Electoral Integrity Assurance Taskforce\" (EIAT) and the \"escalation scenarios\" blurs the lines between state and private power. This collaboration, while intended to protect elections, could lead to concerns about government pressure on platforms to remove content deemed \"disreputable\" (Scenario 9, \"brings a Commonwealth agency into disrepute\"), even if not illegal, potentially chilling legitimate criticism of government bodies or policies. Finally, the targeting of \"Anonymous electoral communication\" (Scenario 7) for \"disclosure entities\" could, if broadly interpreted or expanded, impinge on the right to anonymity, a crucial civil liberty that protects whistleblowers and allows individuals to express dissent without fear of reprisal.\n\nIn conclusion, these documents reveal government and corporate efforts to protect the integrity of the Australian democratic process, with some policies (like Twitter's ad ban and transparency efforts) clearly aligning with progressive calls for reduced corporate influence and fairer elections.

While the stated goal is \"electoral integrity,\" the revealed policies and collaborations raise significant questions about adherence to core conservative principles, particularly individual liberty and limited government.\n\n**Individual Liberty and Limited Government:**\nThe most significant deviation from conservative principles lies in the expansive scope of \"electoral integrity\" pursued by the AEC and its Electoral Integrity Assurance Taskforce (EIAT). The \"Electoral communications escalation scenarios\" document explicitly lists categories for intervention that extend far beyond breaches of Commonwealth law. Most notably, Scenario 11 targets \"Any other electoral communication that may not breach a Commonwealth law, but which may breach Platform policy,\" citing examples like \"false news.\" This reveals a troubling willingness of government to leverage private platforms to police and suppress speech that the government itself cannot legally prohibit. Such a mechanism effectively outsources censorship to private corporations, circumventing constitutional or statutory limitations on government power over free expression.\n\nThe AEC's proactive engagement with platforms like Google and Twitter to discuss \"misinformation as a shared challenge\" and establish \"escalation pathways\" indicates a desire to influence the flow of information on these platforms. Google's policy of demoting \"low-quality\" or \"borderline\" content, even if not illegal, and Twitter's ban on political advertising, while private decisions, are implicitly endorsed and engaged with by the AEC, contributing to a chilling effect on robust political discourse. This partnership risks transforming private companies into de facto arbiters of truth and acceptable political commentary, rather than neutral public squares, thereby centralizing information control and eroding individual liberty.\n\n**National Security:**\nWhile addressing genuine foreign interference (Scenario 5) is a legitimate national security imperative, the documents suggest a broad interpretation of this threat, including \"consistently promote divisive political positions designed to fragment the electorate.\" Such broad definitions could inadvertently sweep in legitimate, albeit controversial, political commentary. Of particular concern is the AEC's engagement with TikTok, a platform owned by ByteDance, a Chinese company. Despite known national security risks associated with Chinese-owned technology and potential data access by the Chinese government, the AEC is actively collaborating with TikTok to create an \"Election Hub\" using the AEC's logo to \"signify... information is reliable.\" This implicit endorsement of a platform tied to an adversarial state for civic education raises serious questions about the government's prioritization of national security and the protection of sensitive data and democratic processes.\n\n**Economic Efficiency and Fiscal Responsibility:**\nThe documents suggest a significant allocation of resources by both government (AEC/EIAT) and private tech companies towards monitoring, identifying, and intervening in online communications. The acknowledgment that \"Detection and attribution can be time and resource intensive\" implies considerable taxpayer money is being directed towards this endeavor. Questioning content that \"may not breach a Commonwealth law\" but merely \"breach Platform policy\" represents a mission creep that could lead to inefficient spending on subjective truth-policing rather than core governmental functions. Furthermore, platforms like Twitter banning political advertising, while a private choice, distorts the market for political communication, potentially increasing campaign costs or forcing reliance on less transparent communication channels. This diverts resources from productive economic activity into regulatory compliance and content policing, raising concerns about overall economic efficiency.\n\nIn summary, while the stated aim is electoral integrity, the documented actions and policies suggest a concerning expansion of government influence over private discourse, a blurring of lines between state and corporate power, and a potential compromise of national security interests through engagement with questionable foreign entities. This represents a significant deviation from conservative principles advocating for individual liberty, limited government, and fiscal prudence.", "model": "gemini-2.5-flash", "generated_at": "2025-06-22T14:45:15.214464", "source_hash": "2dd237674121246f6dfa64a2e46557a2c94020677cb3c37840d71032abd888b4", "raw_response_path": "data/llm_responses/LEX1147__overall__right_leaning__20250622T144515.json", "output_tokens": 764, "prompt_tokens": 42460, "total_tokens": 47232, "summary_length": 4632}, "short_index": {"text": "The Australian Electoral Commission's (AEC) collaborations with major tech platforms for \"electoral integrity\" are deeply concerning from a right-leaning perspective, significantly eroding individual liberty and limited government principles.

TikTok's proposal to create an in-app \"Election Hub\" using the **AEC's official logo** signals a worrying level of official endorsement and trust in a platform with known data security and foreign influence concerns, potentially exposing voters to foreign narrative shaping. This also outsources the government's responsibility for civic information to a private, for-profit entity.\n2.  **Vague \"Disinformation\" Definitions and Potential Overreach:** \"OFFICIAL:Sensitive\" documents outlining \"Electoral communications escalation scenarios\" reveal alarmingly broad definitions of \"foreign interference\" (e.g., social media accounts promoting \"divisive political positions designed to fragment the electorate\") and other problematic content. This vague language grants the AEC, and by extension the platforms, wide latitude to potentially suppress legitimate, albeit critical or unconventional, political discourse under the guise of \"misleading voters\" or \"false news.\" The inclusion of \"breach Platform policy\" as an escalation scenario indicates the AEC leveraging private companies' terms of service for content moderation, effectively deputizing them as state censors.\n3.  **Outsourced Censorship to Unelected Tech Arbiters:** Google's internal document, \"How Google Fights Disinformation,\" highlights its own criteria for promoting \"authoritative, high-quality information\" and identifying \"expertise, authority, and trustworthiness.\" This confirms that unelected tech companies are acting as de facto arbiters of \"truth\" in partnership with government bodies, potentially limiting the diversity of information available to voters by favouring mainstream or official narratives.\n4.  **Inefficient Bureaucracy in \"Collaboration\":** Extensive email exchanges concerning \"initial consultations\" and \"engagement\" with tech companies, often involving multiple reschedules and clarifying basic operational points of contact, suggest significant bureaucratic inefficiency. Taxpayer resources are evidently being expended on prolonged discussions merely to establish basic communication channels, rather than on clear, actionable agreements for election integrity.\n5.  **Lack of Transparency in Enforcement:** While the AEC seeks to establish \"referral & enquiry lines\" for alleged breaches, the specific thresholds and criteria for intervention remain opaque, particularly concerning content that doesn't violate Commonwealth law but is deemed a \"breach of Platform policy.\" The \"OFFICIAL:Sensitive\" classification of crucial policy documents further limits public scrutiny of how these powers are exercised.", "model": "gemini-2.5-flash", "generated_at": "2025-06-22T14:45:39.727283", "source_hash": "2dd237674121246f6dfa64a2e46557a2c94020677cb3c37840d71032abd888b4", "raw_response_path": "data/llm_responses/LEX1147__overall__government_skeptic__20250622T144539.json", "output_tokens": 586, "prompt_tokens": 42456, "total_tokens": 44925, "summary_length": 3224}, "short_index": {"text": "The Australian Electoral Commission's (AEC) collaboration with major tech platforms (TikTok, Google, Twitter) under the guise of \"electoral integrity\" represents an alarming overreach, effectively blurring lines between state and corporate control over information.

The most damning implications are as follows:\n\n1.  **Crippling Regulatory Vacuum and Abdication of Duty:**\n    *   The \"Electoral communications escalation scenarios\" document explicitly admits that for many critical issues, including content that misleads voters or brings agencies into disrepute, the government's legal remedies are too slow (\"issue may be to stop the spread of disinformation during an election campaign\").\n    *   Most egregiously, for content that does not breach Commonwealth law but is clearly harmful (e.g., \"false news,\" \"spam,\" or misinformation about informal voting), the AEC openly states it relies entirely on \"Platform policy.\" This is a staggering admission that the Australian government has **outsourced fundamental aspects of electoral integrity to the opaque, self-regulated terms of service of private, profit-driven corporations.** This abdication of responsibility is a catastrophic failure of governance.\n    *   The document also acknowledges that \"Detection and attribution [of foreign interference] can be time and resource intensive, while disinformation strategies are cheap and agile,\" a chilling confession of being outmatched and outmanoeuvred by malicious actors.\n\n2.  **Alarming Lack of Engagement and Preparedness with Major Platforms:**\n    *   The FOI request explicitly asked for correspondence with Meta (Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp) and LinkedIn. The retrieved schedule lists **zero documents** for these dominant platforms, suggesting a critical failure of engagement or, worse, a deliberate blind spot. This indicates the AEC is either utterly disengaged with the most influential online spaces or their FOI response is deliberately incomplete, both being damning.\n    *   For platforms where engagement *is* evidenced (Google, Twitter, TikTok), it is consistently reactive and belated.\n        *   **Google:** AEC is \"chasing\" Google in May 2021 to \"formally begin our collaboration\" for an election due between August 2021 and May 2022. Google's initial outreach in December 2020 consists of providing *their own* global policies and asking the AEC to \"help us prepare for similar scenarios\" by explaining past Australian \"death tax issue\" misinformation. This shows Google dictating the terms of engagement and relying on the AEC to educate *them* on local threats, rather than Google proactively understanding the Australian landscape. The AEC's reliance on Google's generic \"How Google Fights Disinformation\" (dated *February 2019*) as an FOI response document further highlights this passive, uncritical acceptance of tech company narratives. Google's document itself states their algorithms \"do not identify the intent or factual accuracy of any given piece of content\" and \"avoiding judgments on the veracity of statements made about politics or current events\" \u2013 a direct admission that their priorities conflict with robust election integrity.\n        *   **Twitter:** As late as June 2020, for the Eden-Monaro by-election, the AEC was still asking Twitter to \"confirm the AEC\u2019s point of contact,\" revealing a shocking lack of established, direct communication channels for urgent issues. Furthermore, attempts to schedule \"initial consultations\" for the 2021/22 Federal Election were met with Twitter contacts being on \"unavoidable leave,\" forcing the AEC to accommodate or reschedule, underscoring a power imbalance and a lack of depth in Twitter's Australian engagement. The AEC then segmented meetings, suggesting fragmented, less impactful discussions.\n        *   **TikTok:** In January 2022, just months before the Federal election, TikTok is proactively suggesting an \"Election Hub\" and offering to use AEC links/logo, essentially taking the lead on civic information dissemination. TikTok itself admitted its platform \"aren't really the platform to go to for politics/news,\" yet the AEC is shown to be relying on it.\n\n3.  **Bureaucratic Inefficiency and Lack of Urgency:**\n    *   The constant back-and-forth emails for scheduling \"initial\" meetings, struggling with \"busy calendars,\" and having \"declined\" meeting invites demonstrate internal bureaucratic lethargy and a failure to prioritize crucial pre-election engagement.\n    *   The existence of multiple, slightly different versions of the \"Electoral communications escalation scenarios\" document (e.g., dated 10 August 2021 and 29 October 2021) suggests internal disorganisation, a reactive approach to policy, or a prolonged, inefficient process to finalise critical protocols.\n\nIn summary, these documents paint a damning picture of a government agency unprepared for the realities of modern digital election interference.
