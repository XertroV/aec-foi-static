      <h2>FOI Request Summary</h2>
<h3>Main Purpose of the FOI Request</h3>
<p>The Freedom of Information (FOI) request, identified as [LEX540], was submitted by Vanessa Teague. Its primary purpose was to obtain documents related to the ‘IBM Outputs’ in 2016.</p>
<h3>Documents Retrieved</h3>
<p>A total of 106 documents were retrieved in response to the FOI request. All documents are identified as "IBM Batch Report" PDF files. These reports are dated across June 8, 10, and 15, 2016, and are categorized by "Vote Collection Point" (e.g., Bangor, ABSENT 1, Old Bar, Taree) and "Batch Number".</p>
<h3>Main Content from FOI Request Documents</h3>
<p>The retrieved documents are detailed batch reports providing insights into the processing of individual ballots. Each report typically includes:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Batch Metadata:</strong> Information such as the creation date and time of the batch, the operator who created it, scan status (e.g., <code>Rescan=false</code>), site, and workstation details.</li>
<li><strong>Electoral Event Context:</strong> The Electoral Event ID (19694), State/Territory (NSW), Vote Collection Point (e.g., Bangor, ABSENT 1, Old Bar, Taree), and its corresponding ID, along with the specific Batch Number.</li>
<li><strong>Ballot-Level Details and Checks:</strong> For each ballot within a batch (identified by <code>Ballot Number</code> and <code>Ballot ID</code>), the reports detail various checks performed:<ul>
<li><code>QualityAssurance Checked</code></li>
<li><code>Initials Checked</code></li>
<li><code>Official Mark Checked</code></li>
<li><code>UnusualMarkings Checked</code></li>
<li><code>Formality Result Checked</code></li>
<li><code>Verification Action</code></li>
<li><code>Formality Reason Checked</code></li>
<li><code>ATL Preferences Checked</code> (Above-the-Line Preferences)</li>
<li><code>ATL Mismatches</code></li>
<li><code>ATL Saved Checked</code></li>
<li><code>ATL Breakdown Checked</code></li>
<li><code>ATL Formal Checked</code></li>
<li><code>BTL Preferences Checked</code> (Below-the-Line Preferences)</li>
<li><code>BTL Mismatches</code></li>
<li><code>BTL Saved Checked</code></li>
<li><code>BTL Breakdown Checked</code></li>
<li><code>BTL Formal Checked</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The majority of entries across all checks are marked "OK," indicating successful processing or verification. However, entries explicitly showing "HAS ISSUES" are present across several of the checks, particularly <code>UnusualMarkings Checked</code>, <code>Verification Action</code>, <code>Formality Reason Checked</code>, <code>ATL Mismatches</code>, and <code>BTL Mismatches</code>. These "HAS ISSUES" entries are sometimes accompanied by specific alphanumeric codes (e.g., <code>D2</code>, <code>Y9</code>, <code>M1</code>, <code>U1</code>, <code>AP1</code>, <code>AR1</code>, <code>L1</code>, <code>Q1</code>, <code>S1</code>, <code>Z1</code>, <code>E1</code>, <code>C1</code>, <code>R1</code>, <code>X1</code>, <code>AN1</code>, <code>AB1</code>, <code>AI1</code>, <code>AG1</code>, <code>AK1</code>, <code>AO1</code>, <code>D3</code>, <code>M10</code>, <code>M12</code>, <code>M2</code>, <code>M8</code>, <code>F2</code>, <code>Y3</code>). These codes likely represent specific reasons or categories for the identified issues, which are directly related to the "IBM Outputs" as exceptions or anomalies in the ballot processing.</p>

                  <h2>Document Summary</h2>
<p>This document is an 8-page "SCHEDULE OF RETRIEVED DOCUMENTS" for FOI Request [LEX540] by Vanessa Teague, which sought documents related to 'IBM Outputs' in 2016. It comprehensively lists 106 individual "IBM Batch Report" PDF files. These reports are dated June 8, 10, and 15, 2016, and their filenames clearly indicate a structure categorizing them by Vote Collection Point and Batch Number (e.g., <code>19694NSWHUGH012421780002</code>). A consistent feature across all listed filenames is the <code>_exception.pdf</code> suffix.</p>
<h2>Relevance to the FOI Request</h2>
<p>This document is directly and highly relevant to FOI Request [LEX540] as it serves as the official inventory of the 106 "IBM Batch Report" PDF files yielded by the request. It confirms the exact number of documents, their dates (June 8, 10, and 15, 2016), and their general naming convention (Vote Collection Point and Batch Number), all of which align perfectly with the overview provided for the FOI request.</p>
<p>Crucially, the <code>_exception.pdf</code> suffix on every listed file name directly corroborates the FOI request overview's detail that these batch reports frequently contain "HAS ISSUES" entries for various ballot processing checks (e.g., <code>UnusualMarkings Checked</code>, <code>ATL Mismatches</code>). This schedule explicitly identifies the specific files that document these anomalies and exceptions in ballot processing, which is a key area of interest for the FOI request.</p>

                    <h3>Document Summary</h3>
<p>This document is a two-page "IBM Batch Report" generated on 2016-06-15, detailing the processing of Senate ballots for Electoral Event ID 19694 in NSW, specifically from the Bangor Vote Collection Point (ID 2178), Batch Number 2. The batch was created on 2016-06-10 by operator FXDMS\sioufib at workstation D471702.</p>
<p>The report lists 50 individual ballots (Ballot Numbers 1-50, though not strictly sequential in the table) and presents the results of various automated and manual checks performed on each ballot. These checks include:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>QualityAssurance Checked</code></li>
<li><code>Initials Checked</code></li>
<li><code>Official Mark Checked</code></li>
<li><code>UnusualMarkings Checked</code></li>
<li><code>Formality Result Checked</code></li>
<li><code>Verification Action</code></li>
<li><code>Formality Reason Checked</code></li>
<li>Checks related to Above-the-Line (ATL) and Below-the-Line (BTL) preferences, including <code>Preferences Checked</code>, <code>Mismatches</code>, <code>Saved Checked</code>, <code>Breakdown Checked</code>, and <code>Formal Checked</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>While most entries across all checks for all ballots indicate "OK," two specific ballots show "HAS ISSUES":</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ballot 41:</strong> <code>UnusualMarkings Checked</code> and <code>Verification Action</code> both show "HAS ISSUES." The <code>Formality Reason Checked</code> column indicates specific codes <code>['D2 ', 'Y9 ']</code>.</li>
<li><strong>Ballot 42:</strong> <code>Verification Action</code> shows "HAS ISSUES," and the <code>Formality Reason Checked</code> column indicates code <code>['Y9 ']</code>.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Relevance to the FOI Request</h3>
<p>This document is highly relevant to Vanessa Teague's FOI request [LEX540] as it is precisely one of the "IBM Batch Report" PDF files from 2016 that the request sought.</p>
<ul>
<li>It directly provides "insights into ballot processing" at a detailed, ballot-level granularity.</li>
<li>It contains "batch metadata" (Batch Created, Batch Number, Vote Collection Point, Operator, etc.) and "electoral event context" (Electoral Event ID, State/Territory) as specified.</li>
<li>It demonstrates the "specific ballot-level checks for formality, initials, marks, and preferences (ATL/BTL)" that are described in the FOI request overview.</li>
<li>Crucially, it explicitly illustrates the "HAS ISSUES" entries for various checks (<code>UnusualMarkings Checked</code>, <code>Verification Action</code>) and is accompanied by the "alphanumeric codes (e.g., D2, Y9)" that signify specific anomalies or exceptions, directly matching the key aspect of the FOI request regarding ballot processing issues.</li>
</ul>

                    <h3>Summary of Document LEX540 Batch Report (Bangor, Batch 3)</h3>
<p>This document is a two-page "IBM Batch Report" for Batch Number 3, from the Bangor Vote Collection Point (ID 2178) in NSW, part of Electoral Event ID 19694. The batch was created on 2016-06-10, and the report generated on 2016-06-15. It details the processing outcomes for 50 ballots within this specific batch.</p>
<p>The report provides a comprehensive breakdown of various ballot processing checks, including:<br />
*   <code>QualityAssurance Checked</code><br />
*   <code>Initials Checked</code><br />
*   <code>Official Mark Checked</code><br />
*   <code>UnusualMarkings Checked</code><br />
*   <code>Formality Result Checked</code><br />
*   <code>Verification Action</code><br />
*   <code>Formality Reason Checked</code><br />
*   Multiple checks related to Above-the-Line (ATL) and Below-the-Line (BTL) preferences, including <code>Preferences Checked</code>, <code>Mismatches</code>, <code>Saved Checked</code>, <code>Breakdown Checked</code>, and <code>Formal Checked</code>.</p>
<p>Crucially, for all 50 ballots listed (Ballot 1 through Ballot 50), every single processing check across all categories indicates "OK". No entries for <code>UnusualMarkings Checked</code>, <code>Verification Action</code>, <code>Formality Reason Checked</code>, <code>ATL Mismatches</code>, or <code>BTL Mismatches</code> show "HAS ISSUES" or any associated alphanumeric codes.</p>
<h3>Relevance to FOI Request [LEX540]</h3>
<p>This document is highly relevant to Vanessa Teague's FOI request [LEX540] as it is precisely one of the "IBM Batch Report" PDF files from 2016. It provides concrete insight into the ballot processing records sought.</p>
<p>While the FOI overview states that <code>UnusualMarkings Checked</code>, <code>Verification Action</code>, <code>Formality Reason Checked</code>, <code>ATL Mismatches</code>, and <code>BTL Mismatches</code> frequently show "HAS ISSUES" entries with alphanumeric codes in other reports, this particular document presents a <em>counter-example</em> where all 50 ballots in the batch were processed successfully without any detected issues or exceptions. This indicates that not all "IBM Batch Reports" contained anomalies and provides a baseline for comparison, demonstrating a "clean" batch where all automated and manual checks resulted in an "OK" status.</p>

<p>This document is a two-page "IBM Batch Report" dated June 15, 2016, detailing the processing of Batch Number 4 from the Bangor Vote Collection Point (ID 2178) in NSW, part of Electoral Event ID 19694. The batch was created on June 10, 2016, by operator FXDMS\sioufib.</p>
<p>The report lists 49 individual ballots, identified by "Ballot Number" and "Ballot ID," and records the outcome of various automated and manual checks performed during ballot processing. These checks include:<br />
*   Quality Assurance Checked<br />
*   Initials Checked<br />
*   Official Mark Checked<br />
*   Unusual Markings Checked<br />
*   Formality Result Checked<br />
*   Verification Action<br />
*   Formality Reason Checked<br />
*   ATL (Above The Line) and BTL (Below The Line) preference checks (Preferences, Mismatches, Saved, Breakdown, Formal)</p>
<p>The majority of entries across all checks for all ballots are marked "OK," indicating successful processing. However, two specific ballots show "HAS ISSUES":<br />
*   <strong>Ballot 25:</strong> Marked "HAS ISSUES" for <code>UnusualMarkings Checked</code> with the code <code>['M1 ']</code> and also "HAS ISSUES" for <code>Formality Result Checked</code>.<br />
*   <strong>Ballot 27:</strong> Marked "HAS ISSUES" for <code>UnusualMarkings Checked</code> with the code <code>['U1 ']</code> and also "HAS ISSUES" for <code>Formality Result Checked</code>.</p>
<h2>Relevance to FOI Request [LEX540]:</h2>
<p>This document is directly relevant to Vanessa Teague's FOI request [LEX540] for 'IBM Outputs' from 2016.<br />
*   It is an "IBM Batch Report" PDF file dated within the requested period (June 2016).<br />
*   It provides detailed insights into ballot processing, including batch metadata (Vote Collection Point, Batch Number), electoral event context, and specific ballot-level checks for formality, initials, marks, and preferences (ATL/BTL), fulfilling the scope outlined in the FOI request.<br />
*   Crucially, the document illustrates the "HAS ISSUES" entries and associated alphanumeric codes (specifically <code>M1</code> and <code>U1</code> for <code>UnusualMarkings Checked</code> and <code>Formality Result Checked</code>) that the FOI overview noted were frequently found, signifying specific anomalies or exceptions in the ballot processing. This directly confirms the type of information sought and expected from the 'IBM Batch Report' files.</p>

                  <div class="ai-summary-markdown-content">
                    <p>This document is an "IBM Batch Report" for Electoral Event ID 19694 (2016 Federal Election), specifically for New South Wales, Vote Collection Point Bangor (ID 2178), Batch Number 5. It was created on 2016-06-10 and reported on 2016-06-15.</p>
<p>The report details the processing status of 50 individual ballots within this batch, listing various checks performed on each ballot, including:<br />
*   Quality Assurance<br />
*   Initials and Official Mark verification<br />
*   Detection of unusual markings<br />
*   Formality results and reasons<br />
*   Above-the-Line (ATL) and Below-the-Line (BTL) preference checks (including mismatches, saving, breakdown, and formal status)<br />
*   Verification Actions</p>
<p>For the majority of ballots and checks in this batch, the status is "OK", indicating successful processing. However, Ballot Number 1 shows "HAS ISSUES" for both the <code>Verification Action</code> and <code>Formality Reason Checked</code> columns, while all other checks for this ballot and all checks for other ballots in this report are "OK".</p>
<p><strong>Relevance to FOI Request [LEX540]:</strong></p>
<p>This document is highly relevant to Vanessa Teague's FOI request as it is precisely one of the "IBM Batch Report" PDF files from 2016, categorized by Vote Collection Point and Batch Number. It directly provides the "insights into ballot processing, including batch metadata, electoral event context, and specific ballot-level checks for formality, initials, marks, and preferences (ATL/BTL)" that the request seeks.</p>
<p>Specifically, the "HAS ISSUES" entry for Ballot 1 under <code>Verification Action</code> and <code>Formality Reason Checked</code> aligns with the FOI's interest in instances where checks like <code>UnusualMarkings Checked</code>, <code>Verification Action</code>, and <code>Formality Reason Checked</code> show "HAS ISSUES". While this particular document only contains one such instance and does not include the alphanumeric codes (e.g., D2, Y9) mentioned in the FOI overview, it serves as a concrete example of the type of anomalous ballot processing data that the FOI aims to uncover and analyze.</p>

                    <h3>Document Summary</h3>
<p>This document is a two-page "IBM Batch Report" (specifically Batch Number 6) associated with the 2016 Federal Election (Electoral Event ID 19694) for New South Wales, originating from the Bangor Vote Collection Point (ID 2178). The report, generated on June 15, 2016, details the processing status of 50 individual ballots (numbered 1-50) that were part of a batch created on June 10, 2016.</p>
<p>The report provides a granular breakdown of various automated and manual checks performed on each ballot, indicated by "OK" for successful completion or "HAS ISSUES" for anomalies. Key categories of checks include:<br />
*   <strong>General Checks:</strong> Quality Assurance, Initials, Official Mark, Unusual Markings.<br />
*   <strong>Formality Checks:</strong> Formality Result, Verification Action, Formality Reason.<br />
*   <strong>Preference Checks:</strong> Above-the-Line (ATL) and Below-the-Line (BTL) preferences, including mismatches, saving, breakdown, and formal status.</p>
<p>While most checks for all ballots in this batch show "OK", two specific "HAS ISSUES" entries are recorded:<br />
*   Ballot Number 1: <code>UnusualMarkings Checked</code> - HAS ISSUES<br />
*   Ballot Number 25: <code>Verification Action</code> - HAS ISSUES</p>
<h3>Relevance to FOI Request [LEX540]</h3>
<p>This document is highly relevant to Vanessa Teague's FOI request [LEX540] as it directly aligns with the scope for 'IBM Outputs' from 2016, specifically being one of the "IBM Batch Report" PDF files. Its relevance stems from several points:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Core Document Type:</strong> It is an instance of the "IBM Batch Report" PDF files described in the FOI overview, confirming the nature and format of the requested documents.</li>
<li><strong>Insight into Ballot Processing:</strong> It provides concrete examples of the detailed ballot-level checks (formality, initials, marks, ATL/BTL preferences) performed by the system, offering insights into the operational aspects of ballot processing.</li>
<li><strong>Demonstration of Anomaly Flagging:</strong> The presence of "HAS ISSUES" entries for <code>UnusualMarkings Checked</code> and <code>Verification Action</code> directly supports the FOI overview's description that various checks frequently show such entries. Although this particular document does not feature the alphanumeric codes (e.g., D2, Y9) mentioned in the overview, it illustrates the mechanism by which exceptions or anomalies were identified and flagged for potential further review or action within the ballot processing workflow.</li>
</ul>

                    <h2>Document Summary</h2>
<p>This document is an "IBM Batch Report" dated June 15, 2016, for <strong>Batch Number 7</strong> from the <strong>Bangor Vote Collection Point (ID 2178)</strong> in New South Wales, pertaining to Electoral Event ID 19694. The batch was created on June 10, 2016, by operator <code>FXDMS\sioufib</code> at workstation <code>D471702</code> in Site MBK.</p>
<p>The report details the processing of <strong>50 individual ballots</strong> (Ballot Numbers 1 through 50) within this batch. For each ballot, it provides the status of numerous processing checks, including:<br />
*   <code>QualityAssurance Checked</code><br />
*   <code>Initials Checked</code><br />
*   <code>Official Mark Checked</code><br />
*   <code>UnusualMarkings Checked</code><br />
*   <code>Formality Result Checked</code><br />
*   <code>Verification Action</code><br />
*   <code>Formality Reason Checked</code><br />
*   <code>ATL Preferences Checked</code><br />
*   <code>ATL Mismatches</code><br />
*   <code>ATL Saved Checked</code><br />
*   <code>ATL Breakdown Checked</code><br />
*   <code>ATL Formal Checked</code><br />
*   <code>BTL Preferences Checked</code><br />
*   <code>BTL Mismatches</code><br />
*   <code>BTL Saved Checked</code><br />
*   <code>BTL Breakdown Checked</code><br />
*   <code>BTL Formal Checked</code></p>
<p>Significantly, <strong>all 50 ballots show an "OK" status for every single check</strong> listed, indicating no anomalies or issues were detected during their processing in this batch.</p>
<h2>Relevance to FOI Request</h2>
<p>This document is highly relevant to Vanessa Teague's FOI request [LEX540] seeking "IBM Outputs" and "IBM Batch Report" PDF files from 2016.<br />
*   It is precisely one of the "IBM Batch Report" PDF files, dated June 15, 2016, as specified in the request.<br />
*   It provides detailed insights into ballot processing, covering batch metadata (Vote Collection Point, Batch Number, dates) and granular ballot-level checks (formality, initials, marks, preferences), aligning with the FOI's stated goal of understanding the processing workflow.<br />
*   While the FOI overview mentions that specific checks like <code>UnusualMarkings Checked</code>, <code>Verification Action</code>, <code>Formality Reason Checked</code>, <code>ATL Mismatches</code>, and <code>BTL Mismatches</code> frequently show "HAS ISSUES" entries, <strong>this particular document presents a batch where all entries for these and other checks are "OK"</strong>. This provides an example of a batch that passed all automated and human verification steps without flagging any anomalies, contrasting with the "HAS ISSUES" examples implied by the FOI request's general description.</p>

<p>Crucially, every single check for all 50 ballots in this specific document shows an "OK" status, indicating no issues or anomalies were detected during their processing.</p>
<h3>Relevance to the FOI Request:</h3>
<p>This document is a direct response to Vanessa Teague's FOI request [LEX540] for 'IBM Outputs' from 2016, specifically falling under the category of "IBM Batch Report" PDF files.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Illustrates Ballot Processing Details:</strong> It provides granular insight into the automated and manual checks performed on individual ballots, as requested by the FOI, demonstrating the system's output for a successfully processed batch.</li>
<li><strong>Context for "OK" vs. "HAS ISSUES":</strong> While the FOI overview mentions that many reports show "HAS ISSUES" entries and alphanumeric codes for various checks, this particular document serves as a baseline example where all checks passed successfully ("OK"). It helps to understand what a "clean" report looks like, thereby providing context to interpret reports that do contain issues.</li>
<li><strong>Data Structure Confirmation:</strong> It confirms the typical structure and types of data contained within the "IBM Batch Report" files, including batch metadata, electoral event context, and the detailed ballot-level verification statuses.</li>
</ul>

                    <p>This document is an "IBM Batch Report" for Batch Number 9 from the Bangor Vote Collection Point (ID 2178) in NSW, part of Electoral Event ID 19694. It was created on 2016-06-10 and reported on 2016-06-15. The report details the processing status of individual ballots within the batch, indicating whether various quality and formality checks passed ("OK") or had issues ("HAS ISSUES").</p>
<p>For each ballot, the report provides a status for checks including <code>QualityAssurance Checked</code>, <code>Initials Checked</code>, <code>Official Mark Checked</code>, <code>UnusualMarkings Checked</code>, <code>Formality Result Checked</code>, <code>Verification Action</code>, <code>Formality Reason Checked</code>, and multiple checks related to Above The Line (ATL) and Below The Line (BTL) preferences, mismatches, saving, breakdowns, and formality.</p>
<p>The document's relevance to the FOI request lies in its explicit reporting of "HAS ISSUES" entries, which the request overview highlights as a key area of interest. Specifically:<br />
*   Ballot <strong>39</strong> shows "HAS ISSUES" for <code>UnusualMarkings Checked</code>, <code>Verification Action</code> (with code 'V1 '), and <code>BTL Preferences Checked</code>. It also indicates "HAS ISSUES" for <code>BTL Breakdown Checked</code>.<br />
*   Ballot <strong>46</strong> shows "HAS ISSUES" for <code>BTL Breakdown Checked</code>.<br />
*   Ballot <strong>48</strong> shows "HAS ISSUES" for <code>BTL Breakdown Checked</code>.</p>
<p>These instances demonstrate the presence of specific anomalies and exceptions, with a corresponding alphanumeric code (<code>V1</code>) in one case, aligning directly with the FOI request's objective of insight into ballot processing issues.</p>

                    <h3>Document Summary</h3>
<p>This document is an "IBM Batch Report" for Electoral Event ID 19694 (Senate) in NSW, specifically for Vote Collection Point "Bangor" (ID 2178), Batch Number 10. It was created on June 10, 2016, with a report date of June 15, 2016. The report details the processing outcomes for 54 individual ballots within this batch, identified by Ballot Number and Ballot ID. For each ballot, it records the results of various checks including Quality Assurance, Initials, Official Mark, Unusual Markings, Formality Result, Verification Action, Formality Reason, and all Above-the-Line (ATL) and Below-the-Line (BTL) preference checks (Preferences, Mismatches, Saved, Breakdown, Formal). All 54 ballots listed in this report show an "OK" status across all checked categories, indicating successful processing without detected anomalies for these specific entries.</p>
<h3>Relevance to FOI Request</h3>
<p>This document is directly relevant to Vanessa Teague's FOI request [LEX540] for 'IBM Outputs' from 2016, as it is one of the "IBM Batch Report" PDF files dated June 10 and 15, 2016. It provides the specific ballot-level processing details, including batch metadata, electoral event context, and the comprehensive set of checks for formality, initials, marks, and preferences (ATL/BTL) that the FOI request aims to uncover. While the FOI overview notes that various checks (e.g., <code>UnusualMarkings Checked</code>, <code>Verification Action</code>, <code>ATL Mismatches</code>, <code>BTL Mismatches</code>) frequently show "HAS ISSUES" entries, this particular report serves as an example of a batch where all recorded checks for the processed ballots yielded "OK" results, providing a baseline of successful processing within the broader context of the request for insights into ballot handling and anomaly detection.</p>

                    <h3>Document Summary</h3>
<p>This document is an "IBM Batch Report" for Batch Number 11, dated June 15, 2016, related to Electoral Event ID 19694 (2016 election) for the Bangor Vote Collection Point (ID 2178) in NSW. It provides a detailed log of processing checks for 50 individual ballots (numbered 001 to 050, with some non-sequential ordering within the report) within this batch. Each ballot is assessed against multiple criteria including <code>QualityAssurance Checked</code>, <code>Initials Checked</code>, <code>Official Mark Checked</code>, <code>UnusualMarkings Checked</code>, <code>Formality Result Checked</code>, <code>Verification Action</code>, <code>Formality Reason Checked</code>, and various <code>ATL</code> and <code>BTL</code> preference checks. While the majority of entries indicate "OK" for successful processing, two ballots explicitly show "HAS ISSUES" under the <code>Verification Action</code> column, accompanied by specific alphanumeric codes: ballot <code>19694NSWHUGH012421780011_027</code> with <code>['AP1']</code> and ballot <code>19694NSWHUGH012421780011_028</code> with <code>['M1 ']</code>.</p>
<h3>Relevance to FOI Request</h3>
<p>This document is directly relevant to Vanessa Teague's FOI request [LEX540] as it is precisely one of the "IBM Batch Report" PDF files from 2016 sought by the request, providing insights into 'IBM Outputs' for ballot processing. It confirms the request overview's description of these reports, detailing batch metadata (Vote Collection Point, Batch Number) and ballot-level checks. Crucially, the document explicitly demonstrates the "HAS ISSUES" entries for <code>Verification Action</code> with accompanying alphanumeric codes (<code>['AP1']</code>, <code>['M1 ']</code>), which the FOI overview specifically highlighted as significant anomalies or exceptions in ballot processing. This directly fulfills the FOI's objective of obtaining documents that show such processing irregularities and their associated codes.</p>

                    <p>This document is an "IBM Batch Report" PDF file, dated June 15, 2016, for <code>Electoral Event ID 19694</code> in NSW, specifically covering <code>Vote Collection Point Bangor</code> (ID 2178) and <code>Batch Number 12</code>. It details the processing of 50 ballots (<code>_001</code> to <code>_050</code>) within this batch. Each ballot undergoes a series of automated and manual checks, including <code>Quality Assurance</code>, <code>Initials Checked</code>, <code>Official Mark Checked</code>, <code>Unusual Markings Checked</code>, <code>Formality Result Checked</code>, <code>Verification Action</code>, <code>Formality Reason Checked</code>, and various <code>ATL</code> (Above-the-Line) and <code>BTL</code> (Below-the-Line) preference checks (<code>Preferences Checked</code>, <code>Mismatches</code>, <code>Saved Checked</code>, <code>Breakdown Checked</code>, <code>Formal Checked</code>).</p>
<p>While most checks indicate "OK" for successful processing, the report highlights instances of "HAS ISSUES". For example, Ballot ID <code>19694NSWHUGH012421780012_001</code> shows "HAS ISSUES" for <code>UnusualMarkings Checked</code> with the code <code>['AR1']</code>, and Ballot ID <code>19694NSWHUGH012421780012_003</code> also indicates "HAS ISSUES" for <code>UnusualMarkings Checked</code> with the code <code>['L1 ']</code>.</p>
<p>This document is directly relevant to Vanessa Teague's FOI request [LEX540] for "IBM Outputs" from 2016. It is precisely one of the "IBM Batch Report" PDF files requested, dated within the specified timeframe. It provides concrete examples of the detailed ballot processing insights, batch metadata, electoral event context, and specific ballot-level checks, as well as demonstrating the "HAS ISSUES" entries with associated alphanumeric codes (e.g., <code>AR1</code>, <code>L1</code>) for anomalies, fully aligning with the description of the yielded documents and the scope of the FOI request.</p>

                  <div class="ai-summary-markdown-content">
                    <p>This document is an "IBM Batch Report" PDF, dated June 15, 2016, detailing the processing of Batch Number 13 from the 'Bangor' Vote Collection Point (ID 2178) within Electoral Event ID 19694 for New South Wales. It lists 50 individual ballots, identified by "Ballot Number" and "Ballot ID", and reports the outcome of numerous ballot processing checks.</p>
<p>For each of the 50 ballots, the report provides statuses for checks including 'QualityAssurance Checked', 'Initials Checked', 'Official Mark Checked', 'UnusualMarkings Checked', 'Formality Result Checked', 'Verification Action', 'Formality Reason Checked', and various 'ATL' (Above The Line) and 'BTL' (Below The Line) preference and formality checks (e.g., 'ATL Preferences Checked', 'ATL Mismatches', 'BTL Preferences Checked', 'BTL Mismatches').</p>
<p>The relevance to the FOI request [LEX540] is direct: this document is a specific example of the "IBM Outputs" and "IBM Batch Report" files from 2016 that were sought. It provides granular insight into the ballot processing, including batch metadata and ballot-level check outcomes, as outlined in the request overview. Uniquely, for all 50 ballots detailed in this particular report, every processing check, including those frequently noted as having "HAS ISSUES" in the request overview (such as <code>UnusualMarkings Checked</code>, <code>Verification Action</code>, <code>Formality Reason Checked</code>, <code>ATL Mismatches</code>, and <code>BTL Mismatches</code>), is marked "OK", indicating successful processing without any identified anomalies or exceptions for this specific batch.</p>

                  <div class="ai-summary-markdown-content">
                    <h3>Document Summary: IBM Batch Report for Batch 14, Vote Collection Point Bangor (NSW)</h3>
<p>This document is an "IBM Batch Report" PDF, dated June 15, 2016, detailing the processing of Senate ballots for Electoral Event ID 19694 (2016 federal election) at the Bangor Vote Collection Point (ID 2178), specifically for Batch Number 14. The batch was created on June 10, 2016, by operator FXDMS\sioufib at Workstation D471702.</p>
<p>The report lists 50 unique ballots (Ballot Numbers 1-50, though not sequentially ordered in the initial display) and provides a granular breakdown of various processing checks for each ballot, including:<br />
*   Quality Assurance Checked<br />
*   Initials Checked<br />
*   Official Mark Checked<br />
*   Unusual Markings Checked<br />
*   Formality Result Checked<br />
*   Formality Reason Checked<br />
*   Above The Line (ATL) and Below The Line (BTL) preference checks (Preferences Checked, Mismatches, Saved Checked, Breakdown Checked, Formal Checked)<br />
*   Verification Action</p>
<p>For most of the 50 ballots, all checks are recorded as "OK," indicating successful processing. However, Ballot Number 1 shows "HAS ISSUES" under the <code>Formality Reason Checked</code> column, and the <code>ATL Mismatches</code> column for this same ballot explicitly lists <code>['M12']</code>, signifying a specific type of anomaly or exception.</p>
<h3>Relevance to FOI Request [LEX540]:</h3>
<p>This document is directly relevant to Vanessa Teague's FOI request [LEX540] as it is one of the "IBM Batch Report" PDF files from 2016, falling within the scope of "IBM Outputs."</p>
<p>Its relevance is twofold:<br />
1.  <strong>Confirmation of Document Type and Content:</strong> It confirms the existence and structure of the "IBM Batch Report" files, providing detailed ballot-level processing information, including batch metadata and electoral event context, as described in the FOI request overview. It shows the specific fields <code>UnusualMarkings Checked</code>, <code>Formality Reason Checked</code>, <code>ATL Mismatches</code>, and <code>BTL Mismatches</code> are indeed present in these reports.<br />
2.  <strong>Illustrates "HAS ISSUES" Entries and Codes:</strong> Crucially, it demonstrates the "anomalies or exceptions in the ballot processing" sought by the request. Specifically, Ballot Number 1's entry for <code>Formality Reason Checked</code> shows "HAS ISSUES" and its <code>ATL Mismatches</code> column contains the alphanumeric code <code>['M12']</code>. This directly exemplifies the type of "HAS ISSUES" entries and associated alphanumeric codes (like D2, Y9, M1, U1 mentioned in the request overview) that the FOI request seeks to understand, confirming their presence and format within these documents.</p>

                    <h2>Document Summary: IBM Batch Report for Batch 15, Bangor (NSW)</h2>
<p>This document is an "IBM Batch Report" dated June 15, 2016, detailing the processing of Batch Number 15 for the Bangor Vote Collection Point (ID 2178) in NSW, associated with Electoral Event ID 19694. It records the outcome of various automated and manual checks for 50 individual ballots within this batch, identified by unique Ballot IDs (e.g., <code>19694NSWHUGH012421780015_001</code> through <code>_050</code>).</p>
<p>The report includes detailed columns for checks such as <code>QualityAssurance Checked</code>, <code>Initials Checked</code>, <code>Official Mark Checked</code>, <code>UnusualMarkings Checked</code>, <code>Formality Result Checked</code>, <code>Verification Action</code>, <code>Formality Reason Checked</code>, and various <code>ATL</code> (Above-the-Line) and <code>BTL</code> (Below-the-Line) preference, mismatch, saved, breakdown, and formal checks. For all 50 ballots listed in this specific report, every check across all categories indicates "OK", signifying successful and formal processing without any identified anomalies or issues.</p>
<h3>Relevance to FOI Request:</h3>
<p>This document directly aligns with Vanessa Teague's FOI request [LEX540] for 'IBM Outputs', specifically as one of the "IBM Batch Report" PDF files. It provides granular insight into the ballot processing workflow, confirming the structure and content described in the request overview, including batch metadata, electoral event context, and ballot-level formality and preference checks. While the request overview notes frequent "HAS ISSUES" entries in these reports, this particular document serves as an example of a "clean" batch where all processing checks were successfully passed ("OK"). This demonstrates the system's normal operational output when no anomalies are detected, providing a baseline for comparison with reports that do contain "HAS ISSUES" entries and their associated alphanumeric codes.</p>

                    <h3>Summary</h3>
<p>This document is an "IBM Batch Report" PDF, specifically for Batch Number 16, originating from the Bangor Vote Collection Point (ID 2178) in NSW, relating to Electoral Event ID 19694. The batch was created on June 10, 2016, and the report generated on June 15, 2016. It details the processing outcomes for 50 individual ballots within this batch. For each ballot, the report provides results across numerous verification categories, including Quality Assurance, Initials, Official Mark, Unusual Markings, Formality Result, Verification Action, Formality Reason, and various Above-the-Line (ATL) and Below-the-Line (BTL) preference checks (e.g., preferences, mismatches, saved, breakdown, formal status). The overwhelming majority of checks for all ballots indicate "OK," signifying successful processing. However, one specific entry for Ballot Number 2 shows "HAS ISSUES" under the <code>Formality Reason Checked</code> column, accompanied by the alphanumeric code <code>['O1 ']</code>, indicating a detected anomaly.</p>
<h3>Relevance to FOI Request</h3>
<p>This document is directly relevant to Vanessa Teague's FOI request [LEX540] for 'IBM Outputs' from 2016. It is one of the "IBM Batch Report" PDF files sought, aligning with the specified dates (June 2016) and content type. It provides the detailed ballot-level insights into processing, including batch metadata (Vote Collection Point, Batch Number, Electoral Event ID), as outlined in the request overview. Crucially, the document exemplifies the presence of "HAS ISSUES" entries, specifically the <code>['O1 ']</code> code under <code>Formality Reason Checked</code> for Ballot 2. This directly corroborates the FOI request's mention that <code>Formality Reason Checked</code> often shows "HAS ISSUES" entries accompanied by alphanumeric codes, providing concrete evidence of the types of anomalies and exceptions tracked during ballot processing.</p>

                    <h3>Document Summary</h3>
<p>This document is an "IBM Batch Report" for Batch Number 17 from the Bangor Vote Collection Point (ID 2178) in NSW, created on June 10, 2016, and reported on June 15, 2016. It details the processing of 50 ballots for Electoral Event ID 19694. The report includes batch-level metadata such as operator, workstation, and site. For each of the 50 individual ballots, the document provides the outcome of various processing checks, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Quality Assurance</li>
<li>Initials and Official Mark verification</li>
<li>Unusual Markings assessment</li>
<li>Formality Result and Reason</li>
<li>Verification Action taken</li>
<li>Above-the-Line (ATL) preferences (checked, mismatches, saved, breakdown, and formal status)</li>
<li>Below-the-Line (BTL) preferences (checked, mismatches, saved, breakdown, and formal status)</li>
</ul>
<p>Crucially, all 50 ballots recorded in this report show an "OK" status across all processing checks, indicating that no issues or anomalies were detected for any ballot in this batch.</p>
<h3>Relevance to FOI Request</h3>
<p>This document is directly relevant to Vanessa Teague's FOI request [LEX540] as it is one of the "IBM Batch Report" PDF files from June 2016, providing granular detail on ballot processing. It falls within the requested scope of documents categorized by Vote Collection Point ("Bangor") and Batch Number ("17"). The report fulfills the request's stated objective of yielding insights into ballot processing, including batch metadata, electoral event context, and specific ballot-level checks for formality, initials, marks, and preferences (ATL/BTL).</p>
<p>While the FOI request overview highlights that many "IBM Batch Report" files frequently show "HAS ISSUES" entries for specific checks (e.g., <code>UnusualMarkings Checked</code>, <code>Verification Action</code>, <code>ATL Mismatches</code>), this particular document represents a batch where all recorded checks for all 50 ballots resulted in "OK." This provides a contrasting example within the dataset, illustrating a batch that apparently processed without any identified exceptions or anomalies requiring specific attention.</p>

                    <p>This document is an "IBM Batch Report" dated June 15, 2016, detailing the processing of 50 ballots (Ballot 1-50) for Batch Number 18 from the 'Bangor' Vote Collection Point (ID 2178) in New South Wales, related to Electoral Event ID 19694. The report provides metadata such as creation date (June 10, 2016) and operator details, alongside a comprehensive list of ballot-level checks. These checks include <code>QualityAssurance Checked</code>, <code>Initials Checked</code>, <code>Official Mark Checked</code>, <code>UnusualMarkings Checked</code>, <code>Formality Result Checked</code>, <code>Verification Action</code>, <code>Formality Reason Checked</code>, and various <code>ATL</code> (Above The Line) and <code>BTL</code> (Below The Line) preference assessments (e.g., <code>ATL Preferences Checked</code>, <code>ATL Mismatches</code>, <code>BTL Preferences Checked</code>, <code>BTL Mismatches</code>). For all 50 ballots in this specific batch, every listed check indicates "OK", signifying that no issues or anomalies were detected during their processing.</p>
<p><strong>Relevance to FOI Request:</strong><br />
This document directly responds to Vanessa Teague's FOI request [LEX540] for "IBM Outputs" from 2016, specifically falling under the "IBM Batch Report" category. It provides granular data on ballot processing for a specific batch, aligned with the request's focus on batch metadata and ballot-level checks. While the FOI overview noted frequent "HAS ISSUES" entries, this particular report exclusively shows "OK" for all checks, including <code>UnusualMarkings Checked</code>, <code>Verification Action</code>, <code>Formality Reason Checked</code>, <code>ATL Mismatches</code>, and <code>BTL Mismatches</code>. This absence of issues contributes to the complete picture of ballot processing outcomes sought by the request, demonstrating instances of fully successful ballot processing.</p>

                    <h3>Document Summary</h3>
<p>This document is an "IBM Batch Report" dated June 15, 2016, detailing the processing of 50 ballots for <code>Electoral Event ID 19694</code> in <code>NSW</code>, originating from the <code>Bangor Vote Collection Point (ID 2178)</code> and comprising <code>Batch Number 19</code>. The report includes metadata such as the batch creation time (June 10, 2016, 14:13:31 AEST), the operating workstation, and the processing operator.</p>
<p>The core of the report is a granular log of various ballot-level checks, including <code>Quality Assurance</code>, <code>Initials</code>, <code>Official Mark</code>, <code>Unusual Markings</code>, <code>Formality Result</code>, <code>Verification Action</code>, <code>Formality Reason</code>, and comprehensive <code>Above-the-Line (ATL)</code> and <code>Below-the-Line (BTL)</code> preference checks (e.g., preferences, mismatches, saved status, breakdown, and formal status). While the vast majority of checks for all ballots within this batch are marked "OK," the report identifies three specific instances of "HAS ISSUES":<br />
*   Ballot 22: <code>UnusualMarkings Checked</code> – ['G1 ']<br />
*   Ballot 23: <code>Verification Action</code> – ['R1 ']<br />
*   Ballot 28: <code>Formality Reason Checked</code> – ['AQ1']</p>
<h3>Relevance to FOI Request [LEX540]</h3>
<p>This document is directly relevant to Vanessa Teague's FOI request for 'IBM Outputs' from 2016. It is an example of the "IBM Batch Report" PDF files mentioned in the request overview, specifically dated June 15, 2016, and categorized by Vote Collection Point (Bangor) and Batch Number (19). The report provides the detailed insights into ballot processing, batch metadata, and specific ballot-level checks (formality, initials, marks, and preferences ATL/BTL) that the FOI sought. Significantly, it contains "HAS ISSUES" entries for <code>UnusualMarkings Checked</code>, <code>Verification Action</code>, and <code>Formality Reason Checked</code>, accompanied by alphanumeric codes (G1, R1, AQ1), which directly corresponds to the request's stated interest in identifying and understanding such anomalies or exceptions in the ballot processing data.</p>

                    <p>This document is an 'IBM Batch Report' for Batch Number 20, processed at the Bangor Vote Collection Point (ID 2178) in NSW, with a Report Date of June 15, 2016. It details the processing outcomes for 50 individual ballots. For every ballot within this batch, all listed checks—including <code>QualityAssurance Checked</code>, <code>Initials Checked</code>, <code>Official Mark Checked</code>, <code>UnusualMarkings Checked</code>, <code>Formality Result Checked</code>, <code>Verification Action</code>, <code>Formality Reason Checked</code>, <code>ATL Preferences Checked</code>, <code>ATL Mismatches</code>, <code>BTL Preferences Checked</code>, and <code>BTL Mismatches</code>—are recorded as "OK".</p>
<p>The document's relevance to Vanessa Teague's FOI request [LEX540] lies in its direct correspondence to the 'IBM Outputs' sought. As one of the 106 "IBM Batch Report" PDF files, it provides granular insight into the ballot processing workflow. Specifically, this report exemplifies a batch where all automated and manual checks were completed without detecting any anomalies or requiring specific <code>Verification Action</code> or <code>Formality Reason</code> entries, showing a "clean" processing outcome. This contrasts with the "HAS ISSUES" entries and alphanumeric codes (e.g., D2, Y9) frequently found in other reports, as highlighted in the request overview, thus offering a complete picture of both successful and exceptional ballot processing scenarios.</p>

                    <h3>Document Summary: IBM Batch Report</h3>
<p>This document is an "IBM Batch Report" PDF, identified as <code>aec-senate-batch-uat-19694-NSW-2178-0021-20160610134520.xml</code>, with a creation date of June 10, 2016, and a report date of June 15, 2016. It details the processing of Batch Number 21 from Vote Collection Point ID 2178 (Bangor) in NSW, for Electoral Event ID 19694.</p>
<p>The report lists 50 ballot numbers (though not all are present in this excerpt), along with the outcomes of various ballot-level checks. Key columns include <code>QualityAssurance Checked</code>, <code>Initials Checked</code>, <code>Official Mark Checked</code>, <code>UnusualMarkings Checked</code>, <code>Formality Result Checked</code>, <code>Verification Action</code>, <code>Formality Reason Checked</code>, <code>ATL Preferences Checked</code>, <code>ATL Mismatches</code>, <code>BTL Preferences Checked</code>, and <code>BTL Mismatches</code>.</p>
<p>While most checks indicate "OK" for successful processing, specific issues are noted:<br />
*   <strong>Ballot Number 1:</strong> <code>UnusualMarkings Checked</code> shows "HAS ISSUES", <code>Verification Action</code> shows "HAS ISSUES", and <code>Formality Reason Checked</code> lists <code>['AM1', 'AP1']</code>.<br />
*   <strong>Ballot Number 40:</strong> <code>UnusualMarkings Checked</code> shows "HAS ISSUES", and <code>Formality Reason Checked</code> lists <code>['O1 ']</code>.<br />
*   <strong>Ballot Number 41:</strong> <code>Verification Action</code> shows "HAS ISSUES", and <code>Formality Reason Checked</code> lists <code>['O1 ']</code>.</p>
<h3>Relevance to FOI Request</h3>
<p>This document is directly relevant to Vanessa Teague's FOI request [LEX540] for 'IBM Outputs', specifically being one of the "IBM Batch Report" PDF files from 2016. It provides the requested insights into ballot processing, including:<br />
*   <strong>Batch Metadata:</strong> Date, operator, site, electoral event ID, state, vote collection point, and batch number.<br />
*   <strong>Ballot-level Checks:</strong> Detailed results for each ballot on formality, initials, marks, and preferences (ATL/BTL).<br />
*   <strong>Identified Issues:</strong> The report explicitly shows "HAS ISSUES" entries for <code>UnusualMarkings Checked</code>, <code>Verification Action</code>, and <code>Formality Reason Checked</code>, consistent with the FOI overview's description of common anomalies and exceptions, along with the specified alphanumeric codes (e.g., AM1, AP1, O1). This directly addresses the FOI's interest in understanding ballot processing exceptions.</p>

                    <p>This document is an "IBM Batch Report" PDF, dated June 15, 2016, detailing the processing of 50 ballots within Batch Number 22 from the Bangor Vote Collection Point (ID 2178) for Electoral Event ID 19694 in NSW. It provides batch metadata and a comprehensive breakdown of automated and manual checks for each ballot, including Quality Assurance, Initials, Official Mark, Unusual Markings, Formality Result, Verification Action, Formality Reason, and Above-the-Line (ATL) and Below-the-Line (BTL) preference processing status. While most checks show "OK" for successful processing, two ballots (Ballot 26 and Ballot 37) are flagged with "HAS ISSUES" under 'UnusualMarkings Checked', accompanied by specific codes <code>['E1 ']</code> and <code>['A1 ']</code> respectively.</p>
<p>This document is highly relevant to Vanessa Teague's FOI request [LEX540] as it is a direct example of the "IBM Batch Report" PDF files sought from 'IBM Outputs' in 2016. It provides the detailed ballot-level insights, batch metadata, and electoral event context specified in the request overview. Crucially, it demonstrates the presence of "HAS ISSUES" entries for ballot checks, such as <code>UnusualMarkings Checked</code> with accompanying alphanumeric codes (<code>E1</code>, <code>A1</code>), which is a primary focus area of the FOI request regarding anomalies and exceptions in the ballot processing.</p>

                    <h3>Document Summary: IBM Batch Report for Senate Electoral Event 2016</h3>
<p>This document is an "IBM Batch Report" (Report Date: 2016-06-15) detailing the processing of a batch of 50 Senate ballots for Electoral Event ID 19694 (NSW).</p>
<p><strong>Batch Metadata:</strong><br />
*   <strong>Batch Creation Date:</strong> 2016-06-10T13:49:20+10:00<br />
*   <strong>Operator:</strong> FXDMS\sioufib<br />
*   <strong>Site:</strong> MBK<br />
*   <strong>Workstation:</strong> D471702<br />
*   <strong>Vote Collection Point:</strong> Bangor (ID: 2178)<br />
*   <strong>Batch Number:</strong> 23<br />
*   <strong>Rescan:</strong> False<br />
*   <strong>Batch File:</strong> aec-senate-batch-uat-19694-NSW-2178-0023-20160610134920.xml</p>
<p><strong>Content Overview:</strong><br />
The report provides a line-by-line log for each of the 50 ballots in the batch, detailing the results of various automated and manual checks performed during processing. These checks include <code>QualityAssurance Checked</code>, <code>Initials Checked</code>, <code>Official Mark Checked</code>, <code>UnusualMarkings Checked</code>, <code>Formality Result Checked</code>, <code>Verification Action</code>, <code>Formality Reason Checked</code>, and multiple checks related to Above-the-Line (ATL) and Below-the-Line (BTL) preferences (e.g., <code>ATL Preferences Checked</code>, <code>ATL Mismatches</code>, <code>BTL Mismatches</code>).</p>
<p><strong>Key Findings:</strong><br />
*   The vast majority of checks across all 50 ballots indicate "OK," signifying successful processing and no identified issues for those specific criteria.<br />
*   One entry, Ballot Number 48 (Ballot ID: 19694NSWHUGH012421780023_048), shows "HAS ISSUES" under the <code>Formality Reason Checked</code> column, accompanied by the alphanumeric code <code>['AP1']</code>. All other checks for this specific ballot are marked "OK."</p>
<p><strong>Relevance to FOI Request [LEX540]:</strong><br />
This document directly addresses Vanessa Teague's FOI request by providing one of the "IBM Batch Report" PDF files related to "IBM Outputs" from 2016. It offers specific, granular insight into the ballot processing workflow, including batch metadata and detailed ballot-level quality and formality checks. The presence of a "HAS ISSUES" entry, identified by an alphanumeric code (<code>AP1</code>), for a specific ballot (Ballot 48) is particularly relevant, as the request seeks to understand anomalies and exceptions identified during ballot processing, complementing the <code>UnusualMarkings Checked</code>, <code>Verification Action</code>, <code>Formality Reason Checked</code>, <code>ATL Mismatches</code>, and <code>BTL Mismatches</code> categories noted in the request overview.</p>

It comprehensively lists 106 individual \"IBM Batch Report\" PDF files. These reports are dated June 8, 10, and 15, 2016, and their filenames clearly indicate a structure categorizing them by Vote Collection Point and Batch Number (e.g., `19694NSWHUGH012421780002`). A consistent feature across all listed filenames is the `_exception.pdf` suffix.\n\n## Relevance to the FOI Request\n\nThis document is directly and highly relevant to FOI Request [LEX540] as it serves as the official inventory of the 106 \"IBM Batch Report\" PDF files yielded by the request. It confirms the exact number of documents, their dates (June 8, 10, and 15, 2016), and their general naming convention (Vote Collection Point and Batch Number), all of which align perfectly with the overview provided for the FOI request.\n\nCrucially, the `_exception.pdf` suffix on every listed file name directly corroborates the FOI request overview's detail that these batch reports frequently contain \"HAS ISSUES\" entries for various ballot processing checks (e.g., `UnusualMarkings Checked`, `ATL Mismatches`). This schedule explicitly identifies the specific files that document these anomalies and exceptions in ballot processing, which is a key area of interest for the FOI request.", "model":

of Senate ballots for Electoral Event ID 19694 in NSW, specifically from the Bangor Vote Collection Point (ID 2178), Batch Number 2. The batch was created on 2016-06-10 by operator FXDMS\\sioufib at workstation D471702.\n\nThe report lists 50 individual ballots (Ballot Numbers 1-50, though not strictly sequential in the table) and presents the results of various automated and manual checks performed on each ballot. These checks include:\n\n*   `QualityAssurance Checked`\n*   `Initials Checked`\n*   `Official Mark Checked`\n*   `UnusualMarkings Checked`\n*   `Formality Result Checked`\n*   `Verification Action`\n*   `Formality Reason Checked`\n*   Checks related to Above-the-Line (ATL) and Below-the-Line (BTL) preferences, including `Preferences Checked`, `Mismatches`, `Saved Checked`, `Breakdown Checked`, and `Formal Checked`.\n\nWhile most entries across all checks for all ballots indicate \"OK,\" two specific ballots show \"HAS ISSUES\":\n\n*   **Ballot 41:** `UnusualMarkings Checked` and `Verification Action` both show \"HAS ISSUES.\" The `Formality Reason Checked` column indicates specific codes `['D2 ', 'Y9 ']`.\n*   **Ballot 42:** `Verification Action` shows \"HAS ISSUES,\" and the `Formality Reason Checked` column indicates code `['Y9 ']`.\n\n### Relevance to the FOI Request\n\nThis document is highly relevant to Vanessa Teague's FOI request [LEX540] as it is precisely one of the \"IBM Batch Report\" PDF files from 2016 that the request sought.\n\n*   It directly provides \"insights into ballot processing\" at a detailed, ballot-level granularity.\n*   It contains \"batch metadata\" (Batch Created, Batch Number, Vote Collection Point, Operator, etc.) and \"electoral event context\" (Electoral Event ID, State/Territory) as specified.\n*   It demonstrates the \"specific ballot-level checks for formality, initials, marks, and preferences (ATL/BTL)\" that are described in the FOI request overview.\n*   Crucially, it explicitly illustrates the \"HAS ISSUES\" entries for various checks (`UnusualMarkings Checked`, `Verification Action`) and is accompanied by the \"alphanumeric codes (e.g., D2, Y9)\" that signify specific anomalies or exceptions, directly matching the key aspect of the FOI request regarding ballot processing issues.", "model": "gemini-2.5-flash", "generated_at": "2025-06-23T23:04:06.031549", "raw_response_path":

Number 3, from the Bangor Vote Collection Point (ID 2178) in NSW, part of Electoral Event ID 19694. The batch was created on 2016-06-10, and the report generated on 2016-06-15. It details the processing outcomes for 50 ballots within this specific batch.\n\nThe report provides a comprehensive breakdown of various ballot processing checks, including:\n*   `QualityAssurance Checked`\n*   `Initials Checked`\n*   `Official Mark Checked`\n*   `UnusualMarkings Checked`\n*   `Formality Result Checked`\n*   `Verification Action`\n*   `Formality Reason Checked`\n*   Multiple checks related to Above-the-Line (ATL) and Below-the-Line (BTL) preferences, including `Preferences Checked`, `Mismatches`, `Saved Checked`, `Breakdown Checked`, and `Formal Checked`.\n\nCrucially, for all 50 ballots listed (Ballot 1 through Ballot 50), every single processing check across all categories indicates \"OK\". No entries for `UnusualMarkings Checked`, `Verification Action`, `Formality Reason Checked`, `ATL Mismatches`, or `BTL Mismatches` show \"HAS ISSUES\" or any associated alphanumeric codes.\n\n### Relevance to FOI Request [LEX540]\n\nThis document is highly relevant to Vanessa Teague's FOI request [LEX540] as it is precisely one of the \"IBM Batch Report\" PDF files from 2016. It provides concrete insight into the ballot processing records sought.\n\nWhile the FOI overview states that `UnusualMarkings Checked`, `Verification Action`, `Formality Reason Checked`, `ATL Mismatches`, and `BTL Mismatches` frequently show \"HAS ISSUES\" entries with alphanumeric codes in other reports, this particular document presents a *counter-example* where all 50 ballots in the batch were processed successfully without any detected issues or exceptions. This indicates that not all \"IBM Batch Reports\" contained anomalies and provides a baseline for comparison, demonstrating a \"clean\" batch where all automated and manual checks resulted in an \"OK\" status.", "model": "gemini-2.5-flash", "generated_at": "2025-06-23T23:04:15.611134", "raw_response_path":

15, 2016, detailing the processing of Batch Number 4 from the Bangor Vote Collection Point (ID 2178) in NSW, part of Electoral Event ID 19694. The batch was created on June 10, 2016, by operator FXDMS\\sioufib.\n\nThe report lists 49 individual ballots, identified by \"Ballot Number\" and \"Ballot ID,\" and records the outcome of various automated and manual checks performed during ballot processing. These checks include:\n*   Quality Assurance Checked\n*   Initials Checked\n*   Official Mark Checked\n*   Unusual Markings Checked\n*   Formality Result Checked\n*   Verification Action\n*   Formality Reason Checked\n*   ATL (Above The Line) and BTL (Below The Line) preference checks (Preferences, Mismatches, Saved, Breakdown, Formal)\n\nThe majority of entries across all checks for all ballots are marked \"OK,\" indicating successful processing. However, two specific ballots show \"HAS ISSUES\":\n*   **Ballot 25:** Marked \"HAS ISSUES\" for `UnusualMarkings Checked` with the code `['M1 ']` and also \"HAS ISSUES\" for `Formality Result Checked`.\n*   **Ballot 27:** Marked \"HAS ISSUES\" for `UnusualMarkings Checked` with the code `['U1 ']` and also \"HAS ISSUES\" for `Formality Result Checked`.\n\n## Relevance to FOI Request [LEX540]:\n\nThis document is directly relevant to Vanessa Teague's FOI request [LEX540] for 'IBM Outputs' from 2016.\n*   It is an \"IBM Batch Report\" PDF file dated within the requested period (June 2016).\n*   It provides detailed insights into ballot processing, including batch metadata (Vote Collection Point, Batch Number), electoral event context, and specific ballot-level checks for formality, initials, marks, and preferences (ATL/BTL), fulfilling the scope outlined in the FOI request.\n*   Crucially, the document illustrates the \"HAS ISSUES\" entries and associated alphanumeric codes (specifically `M1` and `U1` for `UnusualMarkings Checked` and `Formality Result Checked`) that the FOI overview noted were frequently found, signifying specific anomalies or exceptions in the ballot processing. This directly confirms the type of information sought and expected from the 'IBM Batch Report' files.", "model": "gemini-2.5-flash", "generated_at": "2025-06-23T23:04:25.769969", "raw_response_path":

Wales, Vote Collection Point Bangor (ID 2178), Batch Number 5. It was created on 2016-06-10 and reported on 2016-06-15.\n\nThe report details the processing status of 50 individual ballots within this batch, listing various checks performed on each ballot, including:\n*   Quality Assurance\n*   Initials and Official Mark verification\n*   Detection of unusual markings\n*   Formality results and reasons\n*   Above-the-Line (ATL) and Below-the-Line (BTL) preference checks (including mismatches, saving, breakdown, and formal status)\n*   Verification Actions\n\nFor the majority of ballots and checks in this batch, the status is \"OK\", indicating successful processing. However, Ballot Number 1 shows \"HAS ISSUES\" for both the `Verification Action` and `Formality Reason Checked` columns, while all other checks for this ballot and all checks for other ballots in this report are \"OK\".\n\n**Relevance to FOI Request [LEX540]:**\n\nThis document is highly relevant to Vanessa Teague's FOI request as it is precisely one of the \"IBM Batch Report\" PDF files from 2016, categorized by Vote Collection Point and Batch Number. It directly provides the \"insights into ballot processing, including batch metadata, electoral event context, and specific ballot-level checks for formality, initials, marks, and preferences (ATL/BTL)\" that the request seeks.\n\nSpecifically, the \"HAS ISSUES\" entry for Ballot 1 under `Verification Action` and `Formality Reason Checked` aligns with the FOI's interest in instances where checks like `UnusualMarkings Checked`, `Verification Action`, and `Formality Reason Checked` show \"HAS ISSUES\". While this particular document only contains one such instance and does not include the alphanumeric codes (e.g., D2, Y9) mentioned in the FOI overview, it serves as a concrete example of the type of anomalous ballot processing data that the FOI aims to uncover and analyze.", "model": "gemini-2.5-flash", "generated_at": "2025-06-23T23:04:34.978614", "raw_response_path":

2016 Federal Election (Electoral Event ID 19694) for New South Wales, originating from the Bangor Vote Collection Point (ID 2178). The report, generated on June 15, 2016, details the processing status of 50 individual ballots (numbered 1-50) that were part of a batch created on June 10, 2016.\n\nThe report provides a granular breakdown of various automated and manual checks performed on each ballot, indicated by \"OK\" for successful completion or \"HAS ISSUES\" for anomalies. Key categories of checks include:\n*   **General Checks:** Quality Assurance, Initials, Official Mark, Unusual Markings.\n*   **Formality Checks:** Formality Result, Verification Action, Formality Reason.\n*   **Preference Checks:** Above-the-Line (ATL) and Below-the-Line (BTL) preferences, including mismatches, saving, breakdown, and formal status.\n\nWhile most checks for all ballots in this batch show \"OK\", two specific \"HAS ISSUES\" entries are recorded:\n*   Ballot Number 1: `UnusualMarkings Checked` - HAS ISSUES\n*   Ballot Number 25: `Verification Action` - HAS ISSUES\n\n### Relevance to FOI Request [LEX540]\n\nThis document is highly relevant to Vanessa Teague's FOI request [LEX540] as it directly aligns with the scope for 'IBM Outputs' from 2016, specifically being one of the \"IBM Batch Report\" PDF files. Its relevance stems from several points:\n\n*   **Core Document Type:** It is an instance of the \"IBM Batch Report\" PDF files described in the FOI overview, confirming the nature and format of the requested documents.\n*   **Insight into Ballot Processing:** It provides concrete examples of the detailed ballot-level checks (formality, initials, marks, ATL/BTL preferences) performed by the system, offering insights into the operational aspects of ballot processing.\n*   **Demonstration of Anomaly Flagging:** The presence of \"HAS ISSUES\" entries for `UnusualMarkings Checked` and `Verification Action` directly supports the FOI overview's description that various checks frequently show such entries. Although this particular document does not feature the alphanumeric codes (e.g., D2, Y9) mentioned in the overview, it illustrates the mechanism by which exceptions or anomalies were identified and flagged for potential further review or action within the ballot processing workflow.", "model": "gemini-2.5-flash", "generated_at": "2025-06-23T23:04:47.422437", "raw_response_path":

**Bangor Vote Collection Point (ID 2178)** in New South Wales, pertaining to Electoral Event ID 19694. The batch was created on June 10, 2016, by operator `FXDMS\\sioufib` at workstation `D471702` in Site MBK.\n\nThe report details the processing of **50 individual ballots** (Ballot Numbers 1 through 50) within this batch. For each ballot, it provides the status of numerous processing checks, including:\n*   `QualityAssurance Checked`\n*   `Initials Checked`\n*   `Official Mark Checked`\n*   `UnusualMarkings Checked`\n*   `Formality Result Checked`\n*   `Verification Action`\n*   `Formality Reason Checked`\n*   `ATL Preferences Checked`\n*   `ATL Mismatches`\n*   `ATL Saved Checked`\n*   `ATL Breakdown Checked`\n*   `ATL Formal Checked`\n*   `BTL Preferences Checked`\n*   `BTL Mismatches`\n*   `BTL Saved Checked`\n*   `BTL Breakdown Checked`\n*   `BTL Formal Checked`\n\nSignificantly, **all 50 ballots show an \"OK\" status for every single check** listed, indicating no anomalies or issues were detected during their processing in this batch.\n\n## Relevance to FOI Request\n\nThis document is highly relevant to Vanessa Teague's FOI request [LEX540] seeking \"IBM Outputs\" and \"IBM Batch Report\" PDF files from 2016.\n*   It is precisely one of the \"IBM Batch Report\" PDF files, dated June 15, 2016, as specified in the request.\n*   It provides detailed insights into ballot processing, covering batch metadata (Vote Collection Point, Batch Number, dates) and granular ballot-level checks (formality, initials, marks, preferences), aligning with the FOI's stated goal of understanding the processing workflow.\n*   While the FOI overview mentions that specific checks like `UnusualMarkings Checked`, `Verification Action`, `Formality Reason Checked`, `ATL Mismatches`, and `BTL Mismatches` frequently show \"HAS ISSUES\" entries, **this particular document presents a batch where all entries for these and other checks are \"OK\"**. This provides an example of a batch that passed all automated and human verification steps without flagging any anomalies, contrasting with the \"HAS ISSUES\" examples implied by the FOI request's general description.", "model": "gemini-2.5-flash", "generated_at": "2025-06-23T23:04:56.701391", "raw_response_path":

8, originating from the Bangor Vote Collection Point in NSW (Electoral Event ID 19694). It was created on 2016-06-10T14:00:03+10:00 by operator FXDMS\\sioufib at Workstation D471702 and reported on 2016-06-15. The associated batch file is `aec-senate-batch-uat-19694-NSW-2178-0008-20160610140003.xml`.\n\nThe report details the processing status of 50 individual ballots (Ballot Numbers 1-50) within this batch. For each ballot, it lists the `Ballot ID` and the results of various processing checks, including:\n*   `QualityAssurance Checked`\n*   `Initials Checked`\n*   `Official Mark Checked`\n*   `UnusualMarkings Checked`\n*   `Formality Result Checked`\n*   `Formality Reason Checked`\n*   `ATL Preferences Checked`\n*   `ATL Mismatches`\n*   `ATL Saved Checked`\n*   `ATL Breakdown Checked`\n*   `ATL Formal Checked`\n*   `BTL Preferences Checked`\n*   `BTL Mismatches`\n*   `BTL Saved Checked`\n*   `BTL Breakdown Checked`\n*   `BTL Formal Checked`\n*   `Verification Action`\n\nCrucially, every single check for all 50 ballots in this specific document shows an \"OK\" status, indicating no issues or anomalies were detected during their processing.\n\n### Relevance to the FOI Request:\n\nThis document is a direct response to Vanessa Teague's FOI request [LEX540] for 'IBM Outputs' from 2016, specifically falling under the category of \"IBM Batch Report\" PDF files.\n\n*   **Illustrates Ballot Processing Details:** It provides granular insight into the automated and manual checks performed on individual ballots, as requested by the FOI, demonstrating the system's output for a successfully processed batch.\n*   **Context for \"OK\" vs. \"HAS ISSUES\":** While the FOI overview mentions that many reports show \"HAS ISSUES\" entries and alphanumeric codes for various checks, this particular document serves as a baseline example where all checks passed successfully (\"OK\"). It helps to understand what a \"clean\" report looks like, thereby providing context to interpret reports that do contain issues.\n*   **Data Structure Confirmation:** It confirms the typical structure and types of data contained within the \"IBM Batch Report\" files, including batch metadata, electoral event context, and the detailed ballot-level verification statuses.", "model":

Electoral Event ID 19694. It was created on 2016-06-10 and reported on 2016-06-15. The report details the processing status of individual ballots within the batch, indicating whether various quality and formality checks passed (\"OK\") or had issues (\"HAS ISSUES\").\n\nFor each ballot, the report provides a status for checks including `QualityAssurance Checked`, `Initials Checked`, `Official Mark Checked`, `UnusualMarkings Checked`, `Formality Result Checked`, `Verification Action`, `Formality Reason Checked`, and multiple checks related to Above The Line (ATL) and Below The Line (BTL) preferences, mismatches, saving, breakdowns, and formality.\n\nThe document's relevance to the FOI request lies in its explicit reporting of \"HAS ISSUES\" entries, which the request overview highlights as a key area of interest. Specifically:\n*   Ballot **39** shows \"HAS ISSUES\" for `UnusualMarkings Checked`, `Verification Action` (with code 'V1 '), and `BTL Preferences Checked`. It also indicates \"HAS ISSUES\" for `BTL Breakdown Checked`.\n*   Ballot **46** shows \"HAS ISSUES\" for `BTL Breakdown Checked`.\n*   Ballot **48** shows \"HAS ISSUES\" for `BTL Breakdown Checked`.\n\nThese instances demonstrate the presence of specific anomalies and exceptions, with a corresponding alphanumeric code (`V1`) in one case, aligning directly with the FOI request's objective of insight into ballot processing issues.", "model": "gemini-2.5-flash", "generated_at": "2025-06-23T23:08:53.711362", "raw_response_path":

Report\" for Electoral Event ID 19694 (Senate) in NSW, specifically for Vote Collection Point \"Bangor\" (ID 2178), Batch Number 10. It was created on June 10, 2016, with a report date of June 15, 2016. The report details the processing outcomes for 54 individual ballots within this batch, identified by Ballot Number and Ballot ID. For each ballot, it records the results of various checks including Quality Assurance, Initials, Official Mark, Unusual Markings, Formality Result, Verification Action, Formality Reason, and all Above-the-Line (ATL) and Below-the-Line (BTL) preference checks (Preferences, Mismatches, Saved, Breakdown, Formal). All 54 ballots listed in this report show an \"OK\" status across all checked categories, indicating successful processing without detected anomalies for these specific entries.\n\n### Relevance to FOI Request\n\nThis document is directly relevant to Vanessa Teague's FOI request [LEX540] for 'IBM Outputs' from 2016, as it is one of the \"IBM Batch Report\" PDF files dated June 10 and 15, 2016. It provides the specific ballot-level processing details, including batch metadata, electoral event context, and the comprehensive set of checks for formality, initials, marks, and preferences (ATL/BTL) that the FOI request aims to uncover. While the FOI overview notes that various checks (e.g., `UnusualMarkings Checked`, `Verification Action`, `ATL Mismatches`, `BTL Mismatches`) frequently show \"HAS ISSUES\" entries, this particular report serves as an example of a batch where all recorded checks for the processed ballots yielded \"OK\" results, providing a baseline of successful processing within the broader context of the request for insights into ballot handling and anomaly detection.", "model": "gemini-2.5-flash", "generated_at": "2025-06-23T23:09:03.759852", "raw_response_path":

It provides a detailed log of processing checks for 50 individual ballots (numbered 001 to 050, with some non-sequential ordering within the report) within this batch. Each ballot is assessed against multiple criteria including `QualityAssurance Checked`, `Initials Checked`, `Official Mark Checked`, `UnusualMarkings Checked`, `Formality Result Checked`, `Verification Action`, `Formality Reason Checked`, and various `ATL` and `BTL` preference checks. While the majority of entries indicate \"OK\" for successful processing, two ballots explicitly show \"HAS ISSUES\" under the `Verification Action` column, accompanied by specific alphanumeric codes: ballot `19694NSWHUGH012421780011_027` with `['AP1']` and ballot `19694NSWHUGH012421780011_028` with `['M1 ']`.\n\n### Relevance to FOI Request\n\nThis document is directly relevant to Vanessa Teague's FOI request [LEX540] as it is precisely one of the \"IBM Batch Report\" PDF files from 2016 sought by the request, providing insights into 'IBM Outputs' for ballot processing.

covering `Vote Collection Point Bangor` (ID 2178) and `Batch Number 12`. It details the processing of 50 ballots (`_001` to `_050`) within this batch. Each ballot undergoes a series of automated and manual checks, including `Quality Assurance`, `Initials Checked`, `Official Mark Checked`, `Unusual Markings Checked`, `Formality Result Checked`, `Verification Action`, `Formality Reason Checked`, and various `ATL` (Above-the-Line) and `BTL` (Below-the-Line) preference checks (`Preferences Checked`, `Mismatches`, `Saved Checked`, `Breakdown Checked`, `Formal Checked`).\n\nWhile most checks indicate \"OK\" for successful processing, the report highlights instances of \"HAS ISSUES\". For example, Ballot ID `19694NSWHUGH012421780012_001` shows \"HAS ISSUES\" for `UnusualMarkings Checked` with the code `['AR1']`, and Ballot ID `19694NSWHUGH012421780012_003` also indicates \"HAS ISSUES\" for `UnusualMarkings Checked` with the code `['L1 ']`.\n\nThis document is directly relevant to Vanessa Teague's FOI request [LEX540] for \"IBM Outputs\" from 2016. It is precisely one of the \"IBM Batch Report\" PDF files requested, dated within the specified timeframe. It provides concrete examples of the detailed ballot processing insights, batch metadata, electoral event context, and specific ballot-level checks, as well as demonstrating the \"HAS ISSUES\" entries with associated alphanumeric codes (e.g., `AR1`, `L1`) for anomalies, fully aligning with the description of the yielded documents and the scope of the FOI request.", "model": "gemini-2.5-flash",

'Bangor' Vote Collection Point (ID 2178) within Electoral Event ID 19694 for New South Wales. It lists 50 individual ballots, identified by \"Ballot Number\" and \"Ballot ID\", and reports the outcome of numerous ballot processing checks.\n\nFor each of the 50 ballots, the report provides statuses for checks including 'QualityAssurance Checked', 'Initials Checked', 'Official Mark Checked', 'UnusualMarkings Checked', 'Formality Result Checked', 'Verification Action', 'Formality Reason Checked', and various 'ATL' (Above The Line) and 'BTL' (Below The Line) preference and formality checks (e.g., 'ATL Preferences Checked', 'ATL Mismatches', 'BTL Preferences Checked', 'BTL Mismatches').\n\nThe relevance to the FOI request [LEX540] is direct: this document is a specific example of the \"IBM Outputs\" and \"IBM Batch Report\" files from 2016 that were sought. It provides granular insight into the ballot processing, including batch metadata and ballot-level check outcomes, as outlined in the request overview. Uniquely, for all 50 ballots detailed in this particular report, every processing check, including those frequently noted as having \"HAS ISSUES\" in the request overview (such as `UnusualMarkings Checked`, `Verification Action`, `Formality Reason Checked`, `ATL Mismatches`, and `BTL Mismatches`), is marked \"OK\", indicating successful processing without any identified anomalies or exceptions

Report\" PDF, dated June 15, 2016, detailing the processing of Senate ballots for Electoral Event ID 19694 (2016 federal election) at the Bangor Vote Collection Point (ID 2178), specifically for Batch Number 14. The batch was created on June 10, 2016, by operator FXDMS\\sioufib at Workstation D471702.\n\nThe report lists 50 unique ballots (Ballot Numbers 1-50, though not sequentially ordered in the initial display) and provides a granular breakdown of various processing checks for each ballot, including:\n*   Quality Assurance Checked\n*   Initials Checked\n*   Official Mark Checked\n*   Unusual Markings Checked\n*   Formality Result Checked\n*   Formality Reason Checked\n*   Above The Line (ATL) and Below The Line (BTL) preference checks (Preferences Checked, Mismatches, Saved Checked, Breakdown Checked, Formal Checked)\n*   Verification Action\n\nFor most of the 50 ballots, all checks are recorded as \"OK,\" indicating successful processing. However, Ballot Number 1 shows \"HAS ISSUES\" under the `Formality Reason Checked` column, and the `ATL Mismatches` column for this same ballot explicitly lists `['M12']`, signifying a specific type of anomaly or exception.\n\n### Relevance to FOI Request [LEX540]:\n\nThis document is directly relevant to Vanessa Teague's FOI request [LEX540] as it is one of the \"IBM Batch Report\" PDF files from 2016, falling within the scope of \"IBM Outputs.\"\n\nIts relevance is twofold:\n1.  **Confirmation of Document Type and Content:** It confirms the existence and structure of the \"IBM Batch Report\" files, providing detailed ballot-level processing information, including batch metadata and electoral event context, as described in the FOI request overview. It shows the specific fields `UnusualMarkings Checked`, `Formality Reason Checked`, `ATL Mismatches`, and `BTL Mismatches` are indeed present in these reports.\n2.  **Illustrates \"HAS ISSUES\" Entries and Codes:** Crucially, it demonstrates the \"anomalies or exceptions in the ballot processing\" sought by the request. Specifically, Ballot Number 1's entry for `Formality Reason Checked` shows \"HAS ISSUES\" and its `ATL Mismatches` column contains the alphanumeric code `['M12']`. This directly exemplifies the type of \"HAS ISSUES\" entries and associated alphanumeric codes (like D2, Y9, M1, U1 mentioned in the request overview) that the FOI request seeks to understand, confirming their presence and format within these documents.", "model": "gemini-2.5-flash", "generated_at": "2025-06-23T23:09:44.867650", "raw_response_path":

2016, detailing the processing of Batch Number 15 for the Bangor Vote Collection Point (ID 2178) in NSW, associated with Electoral Event ID 19694. It records the outcome of various automated and manual checks for 50 individual ballots within this batch, identified by unique Ballot IDs (e.g., `19694NSWHUGH012421780015_001` through `_050`).\n\nThe report includes detailed columns for checks such as `QualityAssurance Checked`, `Initials Checked`, `Official Mark Checked`, `UnusualMarkings Checked`, `Formality Result Checked`, `Verification Action`, `Formality Reason Checked`, and various `ATL` (Above-the-Line) and `BTL` (Below-the-Line) preference, mismatch, saved, breakdown, and formal checks. For all 50 ballots listed in this specific report, every check across all categories indicates \"OK\", signifying successful and formal processing without any identified anomalies or issues.\n\n### Relevance to FOI Request:\n\nThis document directly aligns with Vanessa Teague's FOI request [LEX540] for 'IBM Outputs', specifically as one of the \"IBM Batch Report\" PDF files. It provides granular insight into the ballot processing workflow, confirming the structure and content described in the request overview, including batch metadata, electoral event context, and ballot-level formality and preference checks. While the request overview notes frequent \"HAS ISSUES\" entries in these reports, this particular document serves as an example of a \"clean\" batch where all processing checks were successfully passed (\"OK\"). This demonstrates the system's normal operational output when no anomalies are detected, providing a baseline for comparison with reports that do contain \"HAS ISSUES\" entries and their associated alphanumeric codes.", "model": "gemini-2.5-flash", "generated_at": "2025-06-23T23:10:02.136528", "raw_response_path":

Vote Collection Point (ID 2178) in NSW, relating to Electoral Event ID 19694. The batch was created on June 10, 2016, and the report generated on June 15, 2016. It details the processing outcomes for 50 individual ballots within this batch. For each ballot, the report provides results across numerous verification categories, including Quality Assurance, Initials, Official Mark, Unusual Markings, Formality Result, Verification Action, Formality Reason, and various Above-the-Line (ATL) and Below-the-Line (BTL) preference checks (e.g., preferences, mismatches, saved, breakdown, formal status). The overwhelming majority of checks for all ballots indicate \"OK,\" signifying successful processing. However, one specific entry for Ballot Number 2 shows \"HAS ISSUES\" under the `Formality Reason Checked` column, accompanied by the alphanumeric code `['O1 ']`, indicating a detected anomaly.\n\n### Relevance to FOI Request\n\nThis document is directly relevant to Vanessa Teague's FOI request [LEX540] for 'IBM Outputs' from 2016. It is one of the \"IBM Batch Report\" PDF files sought, aligning with the specified dates (June 2016) and content type. It provides the detailed ballot-level insights into processing, including batch metadata (Vote Collection Point, Batch Number, Electoral Event ID), as outlined in the request overview. Crucially, the document exemplifies the presence of \"HAS ISSUES\" entries, specifically the `['O1 ']` code under `Formality Reason Checked` for Ballot 2. This directly corroborates the FOI request's mention that `Formality Reason Checked` often shows \"HAS ISSUES\" entries accompanied by alphanumeric codes, providing concrete evidence of the types of anomalies and exceptions tracked during ballot processing.", "model": "gemini-2.5-flash", "generated_at": "2025-06-23T23:10:12.659067", "raw_response_path":

(ID 2178) in NSW, created on June 10, 2016, and reported on June 15, 2016. It details the processing of 50 ballots for Electoral Event ID 19694. The report includes batch-level metadata such as operator, workstation, and site. For each of the 50 individual ballots, the document provides the outcome of various processing checks, including:\n\n*   Quality Assurance\n*   Initials and Official Mark verification\n*   Unusual Markings assessment\n*   Formality Result and Reason\n*   Verification Action taken\n*   Above-the-Line (ATL) preferences (checked, mismatches, saved, breakdown, and formal status)\n*   Below-the-Line (BTL) preferences (checked, mismatches, saved, breakdown, and formal status)\n\nCrucially, all 50 ballots recorded in this report show an \"OK\" status across all processing checks, indicating that no issues or anomalies were detected for any ballot in this batch.\n\n### Relevance to FOI Request\n\nThis document is directly relevant to Vanessa Teague's FOI request [LEX540] as it is one of the \"IBM Batch Report\" PDF files from June 2016, providing granular detail on ballot processing. It falls within the requested scope of documents categorized by Vote Collection Point (\"Bangor\") and Batch Number (\"17\"). The report fulfills the request's stated objective of yielding insights into ballot processing, including batch metadata, electoral event context, and specific ballot-level checks for formality, initials, marks, and preferences (ATL/BTL).\n\nWhile the FOI request overview highlights that many \"IBM Batch Report\" files frequently show \"HAS ISSUES\" entries for specific checks (e.g., `UnusualMarkings Checked`, `Verification Action`, `ATL Mismatches`), this particular document represents a batch where all recorded checks for all 50 ballots resulted in \"OK.\" This provides a contrasting example within the dataset, illustrating a batch that apparently processed without any identified exceptions or anomalies requiring specific attention.", "model": "gemini-2.5-flash",

Batch Number 18 from the 'Bangor' Vote Collection Point (ID 2178) in New South Wales, related to Electoral Event ID 19694. The report provides metadata such as creation date (June 10, 2016) and operator details, alongside a comprehensive list of ballot-level checks. These checks include `QualityAssurance Checked`, `Initials Checked`, `Official Mark Checked`, `UnusualMarkings Checked`, `Formality Result Checked`, `Verification Action`, `Formality Reason Checked`, and various `ATL` (Above The Line) and `BTL` (Below The Line) preference assessments (e.g., `ATL Preferences Checked`, `ATL Mismatches`, `BTL Preferences Checked`, `BTL Mismatches`). For all 50 ballots in this specific batch, every listed check indicates \"OK\", signifying that no issues or anomalies were detected during their processing.\n\n**Relevance to FOI Request:**\nThis document directly responds to Vanessa Teague's FOI request [LEX540] for \"IBM Outputs\" from 2016, specifically falling under the \"IBM Batch Report\" category. It provides granular data on ballot processing for a specific batch, aligned with the request's focus on batch metadata and ballot-level checks. While the FOI overview noted frequent \"HAS ISSUES\" entries, this particular report exclusively shows \"OK\" for all checks, including `UnusualMarkings Checked`, `Verification Action`, `Formality Reason Checked`, `ATL Mismatches`, and `BTL Mismatches`. This absence of issues contributes to the complete picture of ballot processing outcomes sought by the request, demonstrating instances of fully successful ballot processing.", "model":

ballots for `Electoral Event ID 19694` in `NSW`, originating from the `Bangor Vote Collection Point (ID 2178)` and comprising `Batch Number 19`. The report includes metadata such as the batch creation time (June 10, 2016, 14:13:31 AEST), the operating workstation, and the processing operator.\n\nThe core of the report is a granular log of various ballot-level checks, including `Quality Assurance`, `Initials`, `Official Mark`, `Unusual Markings`, `Formality Result`, `Verification Action`, `Formality Reason`, and comprehensive `Above-the-Line (ATL)` and `Below-the-Line (BTL)` preference checks (e.g., preferences, mismatches, saved status, breakdown, and formal status). While the vast majority of checks for all ballots within this batch are marked \"OK,\" the report identifies three specific instances of \"HAS ISSUES\":\n*   Ballot 22: `UnusualMarkings Checked` \u2013 ['G1 ']\n*   Ballot 23: `Verification Action` \u2013 ['R1 ']\n*   Ballot 28: `Formality Reason Checked` \u2013 ['AQ1']\n\n### Relevance to FOI Request [LEX540]\n\nThis document is directly relevant to Vanessa Teague's FOI request for 'IBM Outputs' from 2016. It is an example of the \"IBM Batch Report\" PDF files mentioned in the request overview, specifically dated June 15, 2016, and categorized by Vote Collection Point (Bangor) and Batch Number (19). The report provides the detailed insights into ballot processing, batch metadata, and specific ballot-level checks (formality, initials, marks, and preferences ATL/BTL) that the FOI sought. Significantly, it contains \"HAS ISSUES\" entries for `UnusualMarkings Checked`, `Verification Action`, and `Formality Reason Checked`, accompanied by alphanumeric codes (G1, R1, AQ1), which directly corresponds to the request's stated interest in identifying and understanding such anomalies or exceptions in the ballot processing data.", "model": "gemini-2.5-flash", "generated_at":

`aec-senate-batch-uat-19694-NSW-2178-0021-20160610134520.xml`, with a creation date of June 10, 2016, and a report date of June 15, 2016. It details the processing of Batch Number 21 from Vote Collection Point ID 2178 (Bangor) in NSW, for Electoral Event ID 19694.\n\nThe report lists 50 ballot numbers (though not all are present in this excerpt), along with the outcomes of various ballot-level checks. Key columns include `QualityAssurance Checked`, `Initials Checked`, `Official Mark Checked`, `UnusualMarkings Checked`, `Formality Result Checked`, `Verification Action`, `Formality Reason Checked`, `ATL Preferences Checked`, `ATL Mismatches`, `BTL Preferences Checked`, and `BTL Mismatches`.\n\nWhile most checks indicate \"OK\" for successful processing, specific issues are noted:\n*   **Ballot Number 1:** `UnusualMarkings Checked` shows \"HAS ISSUES\", `Verification Action` shows \"HAS ISSUES\", and `Formality Reason Checked` lists `['AM1', 'AP1']`.\n*   **Ballot Number 40:** `UnusualMarkings Checked` shows \"HAS ISSUES\", and `Formality Reason Checked` lists `['O1 ']`.\n*   **Ballot Number 41:** `Verification Action` shows \"HAS ISSUES\", and `Formality Reason Checked` lists `['O1 ']`.\n\n### Relevance to FOI Request\n\nThis document is directly relevant to Vanessa Teague's FOI request [LEX540] for 'IBM Outputs', specifically being one of the \"IBM Batch Report\" PDF files from 2016. It provides the requested insights into ballot processing, including:\n*   **Batch Metadata:** Date, operator, site, electoral event ID, state, vote collection point, and batch number.\n*   **Ballot-level Checks:** Detailed results for each ballot on formality, initials, marks, and preferences (ATL/BTL).\n*   **Identified Issues:** The report explicitly shows \"HAS ISSUES\" entries for `UnusualMarkings Checked`, `Verification Action`, and `Formality Reason Checked`, consistent with the FOI overview's description of common anomalies and exceptions, along with the specified alphanumeric codes (e.g., AM1, AP1, O1). This directly addresses the FOI's interest in understanding ballot processing exceptions.", "model": "gemini-2.5-flash", "generated_at": "2025-06-23T23:11:01.208449", "raw_response_path":

detailing the processing of 50 ballots within Batch Number 22 from the Bangor Vote Collection Point (ID 2178) for Electoral Event ID 19694 in NSW. It provides batch metadata and a comprehensive breakdown of automated and manual checks for each ballot, including Quality Assurance, Initials, Official Mark, Unusual Markings, Formality Result, Verification Action, Formality Reason, and Above-the-Line (ATL) and Below-the-Line (BTL) preference processing status. While most checks show \"OK\" for successful processing, two ballots (Ballot 26 and Ballot 37) are flagged with \"HAS ISSUES\" under 'UnusualMarkings Checked', accompanied by specific codes `['E1 ']` and `['A1 ']` respectively.\n\nThis document is highly relevant to Vanessa Teague's FOI request [LEX540] as it is a direct example of the \"IBM Batch Report\" PDF files sought from 'IBM Outputs' in 2016. It provides the detailed ballot-level insights, batch metadata, and electoral event context specified in the request overview. Crucially, it demonstrates the presence of \"HAS ISSUES\" entries for ballot checks, such as `UnusualMarkings Checked` with accompanying alphanumeric codes (`E1`, `A1`), which is a primary focus area of the FOI request regarding anomalies and exceptions in the ballot processing.", "model": "gemini-2.5-flash", "generated_at": "2025-06-23T23:11:13.306279", "raw_response_path":

Date: 2016-06-15) detailing the processing of a batch of 50 Senate ballots for Electoral Event ID 19694 (NSW).\n\n**Batch Metadata:**\n*   **Batch Creation Date:** 2016-06-10T13:49:20+10:00\n*   **Operator:** FXDMS\\sioufib\n*   **Site:** MBK\n*   **Workstation:** D471702\n*   **Vote Collection Point:** Bangor (ID: 2178)\n*   **Batch Number:** 23\n*   **Rescan:** False\n*   **Batch File:** aec-senate-batch-uat-19694-NSW-2178-0023-20160610134920.xml\n\n**Content Overview:**\nThe report provides a line-by-line log for each of the 50 ballots in the batch, detailing the results of various automated and manual checks performed during processing. These checks include `QualityAssurance Checked`, `Initials Checked`, `Official Mark Checked`, `UnusualMarkings Checked`, `Formality Result Checked`, `Verification Action`, `Formality Reason Checked`, and multiple checks related to Above-the-Line (ATL) and Below-the-Line (BTL) preferences (e.g., `ATL Preferences Checked`, `ATL Mismatches`, `BTL Mismatches`).\n\n**Key Findings:**\n*   The vast majority of checks across all 50 ballots indicate \"OK,\" signifying successful processing and no identified issues for those specific criteria.\n*   One entry, Ballot Number 48 (Ballot ID: 19694NSWHUGH012421780023_048), shows \"HAS ISSUES\" under the `Formality Reason Checked` column, accompanied by the alphanumeric code `['AP1']`. All other checks for this specific ballot are marked \"OK.\"\n\n**Relevance to FOI Request [LEX540]:**\nThis document directly addresses Vanessa Teague's FOI request by providing one of the \"IBM Batch Report\" PDF files related to \"IBM Outputs\" from 2016. It offers specific, granular insight into the ballot processing workflow, including batch metadata and detailed ballot-level quality and formality checks. The presence of a \"HAS ISSUES\" entry, identified by an alphanumeric code (`AP1`), for a specific ballot (Ballot 48) is particularly relevant, as the request seeks to understand anomalies and exceptions identified during ballot processing, complementing the `UnusualMarkings Checked`, `Verification Action`, `Formality Reason Checked`, `ATL Mismatches`, and `BTL Mismatches` categories noted in the request overview.", "model": "gemini-2.5-flash", "generated_at": "2025-06-23T23:11:24.277417", "raw_response_path":

{"overall": {"text": "## FOI Request Summary\n\n### Main Purpose of the FOI Request\n\nThe Freedom of Information (FOI) request, identified as [LEX540], was submitted by Vanessa Teague. Its primary purpose was to obtain documents related to the \u2018IBM Outputs\u2019 in 2016.\n\n### Documents Retrieved\n\nA total of 106 documents were retrieved in response to the FOI request. All documents are identified as \"IBM Batch Report\" PDF files. These reports are dated across June 8, 10, and 15, 2016, and are categorized by \"Vote Collection Point\" (e.g., Bangor, ABSENT 1, Old Bar, Taree) and \"Batch Number\".\n\n### Main Content from FOI Request Documents\n\nThe retrieved documents are detailed batch reports providing insights into the processing of individual ballots. Each report typically includes:\n\n*   **Batch Metadata:** Information such as the creation date and time of the batch, the operator who created it, scan status (e.g., `Rescan=false`), site, and workstation details.\n*   **Electoral Event Context:** The Electoral Event ID (19694), State/Territory (NSW), Vote Collection Point (e.g., Bangor, ABSENT 1, Old Bar, Taree), and its corresponding ID, along with the specific Batch Number.\n*   **Ballot-Level Details and Checks:** For each ballot within a batch (identified by `Ballot Number` and `Ballot ID`), the reports detail various checks performed:\n    *   `QualityAssurance Checked`\n    *   `Initials Checked`\n    *   `Official Mark Checked`\n    *   `UnusualMarkings Checked`\n    *   `Formality Result Checked`\n    *   `Verification Action`\n    *   `Formality Reason Checked`\n    *   `ATL Preferences Checked` (Above-the-Line Preferences)\n    *   `ATL Mismatches`\n    *   `ATL Saved Checked`\n    *   `ATL Breakdown Checked`\n    *   `ATL Formal Checked`\n    *   `BTL Preferences Checked` (Below-the-Line Preferences)\n    *   `BTL Mismatches`\n    *   `BTL Saved Checked`\n    *   `BTL Breakdown Checked`\n    *   `BTL Formal Checked`\n\nThe majority of entries across all checks are marked \"OK,\" indicating successful processing or verification. However, entries explicitly showing \"HAS ISSUES\" are present across several of the checks, particularly `UnusualMarkings Checked`, `Verification Action`, `Formality Reason Checked`, `ATL Mismatches`, and `BTL Mismatches`. These \"HAS ISSUES\" entries are sometimes accompanied by specific alphanumeric codes (e.g., `D2`, `Y9`, `M1`, `U1`, `AP1`, `AR1`, `L1`, `Q1`, `S1`, `Z1`, `E1`, `C1`, `R1`, `X1`, `AN1`, `AB1`, `AI1`, `AG1`, `AK1`, `AO1`, `D3`, `M10`, `M12`, `M2`, `M8`, `F2`, `Y3`). These codes likely represent specific reasons or categories for the identified issues, which are directly related to the \"IBM Outputs\" as exceptions or anomalies in the ballot processing.", "model": "gemini-2.5-flash", "generated_at": "2025-06-22T15:06:50.172483", "source_hash": "8337766698340192effe0362a1dcd01f859ed19f6607e02f6bb2c70f9d33fe59", "raw_response_path": "data/llm_responses/LEX540__overall__balanced__20250622T150650.json", "output_tokens": 737, "prompt_tokens": 347983, "total_tokens": 349727, "summary_length": 2687}, "short_index": {"text": "Vanessa Teague's FOI request [LEX540] sought documents related to 'IBM Outputs' from 2016, yielding 106 \"IBM Batch Report\" PDF files dated June 8, 10, and 15, 2016, categorized by Vote Collection Point and Batch Number.
