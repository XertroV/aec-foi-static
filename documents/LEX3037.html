      <h2>Summary of FOI Request Documents (FOI Request No. LEX3037)</h2>
<h3>Main Purpose of the FOI Request</h3>
<p>The FOI request (No. LEX3037) sought "all correspondence about compliance with the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 or relating to elections in 2022" between the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) and major technology companies. These companies include US technology firms such as Meta (Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp), Twitter, Google, Telegram, and LinkedIn, as well as Chinese technology company ByteDance (TikTok). The request specifically covered correspondence created between 28/1/2022 to the date of the request.</p>
<h3>Documents from the FOI Request</h3>
<p>The released documents consist primarily of:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Schedules of Released Documents:</strong> Detailed lists of individual documents (emails, letters, agendas, reports) with dates and descriptions.</li>
<li><strong>Electoral Communications Escalation Scenarios:</strong> A document dated 29 October 2021 (with an updated version by Google on 7 April 2022) outlining 11 scenarios of electoral communications that could infringe Commonwealth law or platform policy.</li>
<li><strong>Emails and Letters:</strong> Extensive correspondence between the AEC and:<ul>
<li><strong>Microsoft:</strong> Emails and letters related to "Electoral Integrity Assurance Taskforce" meetings and content referrals.</li>
<li><strong>Google (including YouTube):</strong> Numerous emails regarding content referrals, election integrity briefings, and "Your Request to Google" messages for content review and removal.</li>
<li><strong>TikTok:</strong> Emails concerning content referrals, escalation processes, and updates regarding election content.</li>
<li><strong>Twitter:</strong> A large volume of emails related to content referrals concerning election integrity and civic-related content.</li>
<li><strong>Meta (Facebook/Instagram):</strong> Emails regarding content requests, post-election wrap-ups, and a detailed document outlining Meta's preparations for the 2022 Australian Election.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Meeting Agendas:</strong> Agendas for meetings between the AEC's Electoral Integrity Assurance Taskforce (EIAT) and representatives from Microsoft, Google, TikTok, Twitter, and Meta.</li>
<li><strong>Reports/Briefings:</strong> An undated document titled "How Meta is Preparing for the 2022 Australian Election."</li>
</ul>
<p>While Telegram and LinkedIn were mentioned in the FOI request, no specific documents pertaining to these companies were listed in the released schedule.</p>
<h3>Main Content from the FOI Request Documents</h3>
<p>The documents reveal the AEC's proactive engagement with major tech companies to safeguard the integrity of the 2022 Australian federal election, primarily focusing on combating misinformation, disinformation, and non-compliant electoral communications.</p>
<p><strong>Key Themes and Content:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Electoral Communications Escalation Scenarios:</strong> This foundational document served as a guide for identifying and escalating problematic content. It details scenarios ranging from:</p>
<ul>
<li>Unauthorised paid electoral advertisements (Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918, s 321D).</li>
<li>Misleading voters on how to cast their votes (s 329).</li>
<li>Impersonation of Commonwealth officials or entities.</li>
<li>Communications by foreign entities.</li>
<li>Foreign interference and threats of terrorist action.</li>
<li>Anonymous electoral communications.</li>
<li>Defamatory content or content bringing a Commonwealth agency into disrepute.</li>
<li>Hate speech.</li>
<li>Other communications that breach platform policies (e.g., spam, false news).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Collaboration and Communication Channels:</strong> The correspondence highlights the establishment and use of direct communication channels between the AEC's Electoral Integrity Assurance Taskforce (EIAT), Authorisation Section, and Social Media teams with the tech companies. This includes dedicated email addresses for content referrals and regular meetings to discuss election preparedness, integrity measures, and emerging threats.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Content Referrals and Moderation:</strong> A significant portion of the correspondence involves the AEC referring specific content for review and potential removal by the platforms. Examples of content referred include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Google (YouTube):</strong> Videos containing unauthorised electoral matter (breaching s 321D CEA), privacy violations (e.g., recording without consent under Queensland law), and electoral disinformation (e.g., claims of election fraud). Google/YouTube's responses show content being blocked or removed for violating community guidelines, or in some cases, not meeting their legal policies for removal.</li>
<li><strong>TikTok:</strong> Posts misleading about voter enrolment deadlines, videos making false claims about election fraud and lack of authorisation, accounts impersonating the AEC, and videos filmed inside polling places without permission or recording AEC staff without consent. TikTok's responses consistently indicate content or accounts were reviewed and removed for violating their community guidelines.</li>
<li><strong>Twitter:</strong> Numerous instances of the AEC flagging tweets related to "election integrity and/or civic-related content" and "electoral misinformation." The specific actions taken by Twitter on these flagged items are often noted as "we have an answer about..." or involve requests for more information.</li>
<li><strong>Meta:</strong> Referrals for Facebook posts regarding electorates and other content requests. The nature of these specific content breaches is less detailed in the provided schedule descriptions, but Meta confirms receipt of these requests.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Platform-Specific Election Integrity Initiatives:</strong> Documents also detail the tech companies' own efforts to ensure election integrity:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Meta:</strong> Expanded third-party fact-checking (e.g., RMIT FactLab joining AFP, AAP), public awareness campaigns (e.g., "Check the Facts" in multiple languages), efforts to combat coordinated inauthentic behaviour, security programs (Facebook Protect for candidates), mandatory transparency for political ads ("Paid for by" disclaimers, Ad Library), and civic engagement features (voter reminders, Instagram stickers).</li>
<li><strong>Google:</strong> Election integrity briefings, and guidance on how to flag issues on their platforms (Search, Ads, YouTube).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In summary, the documents illustrate a collaborative effort between the AEC and major social media platforms to identify, monitor, and address electoral misinformation, non-compliance with Australian electoral law, and other integrity threats during the 2022 federal election, primarily through established communication channels and content moderation processes.</p>

      <p>The FOI documents detail correspondence between the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) and major technology companies (Google, Meta, Twitter, TikTok, Microsoft) concerning the integrity of the 2022 Australian federal election. This interaction centers on identifying and responding to various forms of problematic online content, ranging from electoral misinformation to potential foreign interference.</p>
<p><strong>Corporate Influence &amp; Wealth Distribution:</strong><br />
The documents reveal a significant reliance by the AEC on large, for-profit global technology companies to maintain electoral integrity online. The "Electoral Integrity Assurance Taskforce" and its consistent engagement with these tech giants highlight a model where essential democratic functions – policing disinformation, managing communication, and enforcing electoral law online – are largely outsourced to private entities. This aligns with a progressive critique regarding the undue influence of powerful corporations over public infrastructure and democratic processes. While these companies commit resources (e.g., Meta's stated $5-7 billion investment in safety/security), the fundamental power asymmetry is clear: public institutions are dependent on the willingness and operational decisions of private corporations, whose primary obligation is to shareholders. This central role of tech companies in mediating national discourse underscores concerns about wealth concentration and the privatization of public goods, where profits are privatized but societal risks, like disinformation, are broadly socialized.</p>
<p><strong>Social Justice:</strong><br />
From a social justice perspective, the AEC's efforts, supported by these platforms, to combat misinformation and unauthorized electoral communications are broadly aligned with ensuring a fair and informed democratic process, a cornerstone of social justice. The detection and removal of content designed to mislead voters on how to cast votes (Scenario 2), impersonate officials (Scenario 3), or contain hate speech (Scenario 10) directly contribute to a more equitable and safe electoral environment. Meta's initiative to translate its "Check the Facts" media literacy campaign into Vietnamese, Simplified Chinese, and Arabic is a notable positive step, promoting linguistic diversity and ensuring broader access to accurate information for non-English speaking communities. However, the reactive nature of many content moderation efforts, relying on reports and post-publication removal, may be insufficient to proactively protect marginalized groups from targeted disinformation campaigns.</p>
<p><strong>Civil Liberties:</strong><br />
The documents highlight a delicate balance between safeguarding electoral integrity and upholding civil liberties, particularly freedom of expression. The AEC's focus on transparency in political advertising (requiring authorization, combating anonymous communications) generally aligns with progressive values by promoting accountability and informed voter choice. However, scenarios like "electoral communication…brings a Commonwealth agency into disrepute" (Scenario 9) raise concerns. From a left-leaning perspective, such a broad category could potentially be used to stifle legitimate criticism or dissent against government bodies, blurring the line between protecting democratic institutions and suppressing free speech. Furthermore, the power of tech platforms to remove content based on their internal "Platform policy" even when no Commonwealth law is breached (Scenario 11) indicates a significant, non-democratically accountable power to regulate public discourse, which could inadvertently lead to censorship or limit diverse viewpoints. Conversely, instances where Google declined removal requests because content didn't breach <em>legal policies</em> (though it might violate platform terms) suggest a degree of adherence to legal frameworks over blanket censorship.</p>
<p><strong>Environmental Impact:</strong><br />
Direct mentions of environmental impact are absent from these documents, as their scope is strictly electoral integrity. However, Meta's "social issue ads" policy, which includes "environmental politics" as an area requiring transparency, suggests a superficial alignment with environmental transparency efforts by requiring disclosure for related political advertisements. This is not an assessment of environmental impact itself, but rather a regulatory framework around communication on the topic.</p>
<p>In summary, while the government's actions, through the AEC, align with progressive values in seeking to protect democratic integrity, ensure transparency in political communication, and combat harmful speech, the profound reliance on opaque, for-profit corporate entities to achieve these goals represents a significant deviation. This dependency raises concerns about corporate influence, the ultimate accountability of content moderation decisions, and the potential for a chilling effect on civil liberties, highlighting a need for stronger public governance and oversight of digital information spaces.</p>

    <div class="ai-summary-markdown-content">
      <p>These FOI documents reveal extensive communication and collaboration between the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) and major technology companies (Meta, Google, TikTok, Twitter, Microsoft) concerning the 2022 federal election. From a politically right-leaning analytical perspective, this interaction raises significant concerns regarding adherence to conservative principles, particularly individual liberty, limited government, and economic efficiency, while also noting aspects related to national security.</p>
<p><strong>Individual Liberty (Freedom of Speech):</strong> The documents demonstrate a proactive approach by the AEC to monitor and influence content on private digital platforms. The "Electoral Communications escalations scenarios" document outlines various categories for intervention, including "electoral communication that misleads voters" (Scenario 2), "impersonates a Commonwealth official" (Scenario 3), or "brings a Commonwealth agency into disrepute" (Scenario 9). Most concerning is Scenario 11, which permits escalation for "any other electoral communication that may not breach a Commonwealth law, but which may breach Platform policy." This last point signifies a deviation from conservative principles of free speech, suggesting a government-backed effort to manage the information environment by leveraging private companies' terms of service, effectively creating a form of censorship by proxy. Repeated emails show the AEC flagging content for removal, often successfully, for reasons ranging from "unauthorised" electoral matter to "electoral misinformation," and even for "recording AEC staff without consent." While combating genuine fraud or illegal impersonation aligns with public order, the broad scope of "misinformation" and "bringing agency into disrepute" opens the door to suppressing legitimate, albeit critical or unpopular, political expression and dissenting views. The focus on "fact-checking" that leads to "significantly reduc[ed] distribution" of content, as mentioned in Meta's preparatory document, further points to a managed discourse rather than a truly free exchange of ideas.</p>
<p><strong>Limited Government:</strong> The establishment and active operation of the "Electoral Integrity Assurance Taskforce" (EIAT) and its regular engagement with major tech companies represents a considerable expansion of government influence into the digital public square. This level of intervention goes beyond the traditional role of a limited government, as it involves an administrative body actively monitoring, flagging, and requesting the removal of content from private platforms, even when no explicit Commonwealth law is broken. Such collaboration blurs the lines between governmental authority and private corporate action, potentially deputizing tech companies as de facto enforcers of the government's preferred narrative. This overreach risks creating a precedent where government agencies can pressure private entities to restrict speech that is not illegal but deemed undesirable by the state.</p>
<p><strong>National Security (Foreign Interference):</strong> The documents do show alignment with conservative principles regarding national security by addressing foreign influence and interference (Scenarios 4 and 5). The concern about "electoral communication made by or on behalf of foreign person or entity that is registrable under the Foreign Influence Transparency Scheme Act 2018 (FITS Act)" and other forms of "foreign interference" reflects a legitimate interest in protecting national sovereignty. However, the "policy" definition of foreign interference, which includes promoting "divisive political positions designed to fragment the electorate" (Scenario 5), could be interpreted broadly, potentially sweeping in legitimate domestic political debate that is simply deemed "divisive" by government agencies. A conservative perspective would advocate for clear distinctions between genuine foreign espionage/meddling and domestic political discourse, even if robust or contentious.</p>
<p><strong>Economic Efficiency &amp; Fiscal Responsibility:</strong> While the documents do not provide specific cost figures, the existence of a dedicated "Electoral Integrity Assurance Taskforce," its regular meetings, and the volume of correspondence exchanged with multiple large tech companies imply a significant allocation of taxpayer resources (staff time, administrative overhead). From a fiscal responsibility standpoint, a right-leaning analysis would question whether such extensive government machinery dedicated to digital content policing is the most efficient and fiscally prudent use of public funds, especially when considering the potential impact on individual liberties.</p>
<p>In summary, while aspects of national security (countering foreign interference) align with conservative concerns, the overwhelming impression from these documents is one of government expansion and overreach into the digital speech domain. The extensive collaboration with tech companies for content moderation, particularly for content that does not violate Australian law but merely platform policy, represents a significant deviation from the core conservative principles of limited government and robust individual liberty, raising concerns about a managed public discourse rather than a truly free and open one.</p>

    <div class="ai-summary-markdown-content">
      <p>The released FOI documents paint a concerning picture of the Australian Electoral Commission's (AEC) deep and extensive collaboration with major technology companies (Google, TikTok, Twitter, Meta/Facebook, Microsoft) in the lead-up to the 2022 federal election. Far from merely enforcing Australian law, the documents reveal a proactive and arguably overreaching strategy by a government body to influence and control online discourse, often relying on the subjective "terms of service" of private corporations rather than the Commonwealth Electoral Act itself.</p>
<p>Key observations from a skeptical perspective:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Delegated Censorship and Overreach:</strong> The "Electoral Communications Escalation Scenarios" document (updated by Google, notably) explicitly includes "Scenario 11: Any other electoral communication that may not breach a Commonwealth law, but which may breach Platform policy." This is a critical admission: the AEC actively requests the removal of content <em>that is not illegal under Australian law</em>, instead leveraging the private, opaque, and often inconsistently applied "community guidelines" of tech platforms. This allows the government to bypass due process and legal scrutiny, effectively outsourcing censorship to unaccountable private entities.</li>
<li><strong>Corporate Influence on Government Policy:</strong> The fact that the "Electoral Communications Escalation Scenarios" document was "Updated by Google on 7 April 2022" is highly problematic. It suggests that a foreign private corporation is directly influencing or co-authoring the operational guidelines for an Australian government body concerning electoral communications. This blurs the lines of sovereignty and raises serious questions about undue corporate influence on public administration and democratic processes.</li>
<li><strong>Lack of Transparency and Accountability:</strong> The vast majority of the "released documents" are merely a schedule of correspondence, providing little to no insight into the actual content of the flagged material or the detailed justification for its referral. The numerous generic "Your Request has been received" and "Content has been removed" emails from tech companies offer minimal transparency, making it impossible for the public to scrutinize what content was targeted, why, or whether removals were justified. This opaque process undermines public trust in both government and tech platforms.</li>
<li><strong>Ambiguous Justifications for Removal:</strong> While some referrals relate to clear legal violations (e.g., impersonation of AEC officials), many are vaguely defined, such as "electoral misinformation" or "disinformation." For instance, a TikTok video accusing the AEC of "rigging the election" was removed. While such claims might be false, their removal by government-prompted corporate action raises concerns about suppressing critical, albeit erroneous, public discourse rather than engaging with it transparently. The removal of a video "filmed inside a polling place without permission, potentially identifies an AEC staff member" also suggests a move to control public documentation of electoral processes, potentially hindering transparency and public scrutiny.</li>
<li><strong>Resource Allocation and Inefficiency:</strong> The sheer volume of individual email referrals between the AEC and various platforms, often for minor or recurring issues (e.g., lack of proper authorisation on content), indicates a significant allocation of government resources to content policing. This manual, reactive approach raises questions about the efficient use of taxpayer money and whether such extensive surveillance and intervention in online speech is a primary or appropriate function for an electoral commission.</li>
</ul>
<p>In essence, these documents reveal an electoral body deeply entangled with private tech companies, not merely to enforce laws, but to actively manage and suppress online speech based on the platforms' own, often arbitrary, rules. This collaboration represents a quiet expansion of governmental control over information, achieved through a partnership with powerful, non-state actors, thereby circumventing traditional legal checks and balances and diminishing transparency.</p>

    <div class="ai-summary-markdown-content">
      <p>The released FOI documents demonstrate the Australian government's unwavering commitment to upholding the integrity and security of the 2022 federal election. Through the proactive efforts of the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) and its dedicated Electoral Integrity Assurance Taskforce (EIAT), robust frameworks and strong partnerships were established with major technology companies, including Google, Meta, TikTok, Twitter, and Microsoft.</p>
<p>A key highlight is the foresight shown in developing the "Electoral Communications Escalation Scenarios" well in advance of the election, outlining potential threats such as unauthorised advertising, misleading information, impersonation of officials, foreign interference, and hate speech. This strategic planning enabled the government to anticipate challenges and implement effective response mechanisms.</p>
<p>Throughout the election period, the AEC engaged in extensive and collaborative correspondence with these tech platforms. This engagement focused on critical areas such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Combating Misinformation and Disinformation:</strong> The AEC actively referred instances of electoral misinformation and content likely to mislead voters on how to cast their votes. Tech companies responded swiftly, with documents showing successful content removals and blocking of videos that violated electoral laws or platform policies.</li>
<li><strong>Ensuring Transparency and Authorisation:</strong> The government emphasised the necessity of proper authorisation for electoral communications, as mandated by the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918. This ensured voters were aware of the source of political messaging, promoting accountability.</li>
<li><strong>Protecting Against Impersonation:</strong> Swift action was taken to address instances of entities impersonating the AEC, with tech platforms promptly removing such deceptive accounts or content, thereby safeguarding public trust in official information sources.</li>
<li><strong>Upholding Privacy and Safety:</strong> Concerns regarding the unauthorised recording of AEC staff in polling places were immediately addressed, demonstrating the government's commitment to protecting the privacy and safety of those administering the election.</li>
<li><strong>Proactive Security Measures:</strong> Beyond reactive content moderation, the documents reveal Meta's comprehensive preparations, including expanding fact-checking programs, launching media literacy campaigns, combating influence operations, and offering security programs like "Facebook Protect" to candidates. Similarly, Google provided resources like its "Civics Training Centre" and political advertising transparency reports, empowering participants and the public.</li>
</ul>
<p>The numerous emails detailing content referrals and subsequent removals by the tech companies underscore the effectiveness of these collaborations. These efforts ensured that any challenges to the integrity of the electoral process were swiftly identified, managed, and mitigated, reinforcing the fairness and reliability of Australia's democratic system. The government's proactive engagement and strong partnerships with industry leaders were instrumental in delivering a secure and credible election for all Australians.</p>

    <div class="ai-summary-markdown-content">
      <p>The released FOI documents paint a damning picture of the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) and the Australian government's abject failure to assert sovereignty and control over the integrity of the 2022 federal election, instead ceding critical oversight to foreign-owned social media corporations.</p>
<p><strong>1. Abdication of Sovereignty and Legislative Failure:</strong><br />
The documents reveal a shocking reliance on the "community guidelines" and internal "legal policies" of foreign tech giants like Google, Meta, and TikTok, rather than robust Australian law. The AEC's own "Electoral Communications Escalation Scenarios" document explicitly admits a critical legal vacuum, noting that some issues "may not breach a Commonwealth law, but which may breach Platform policy." This is a catastrophic confession of legislative negligence, leaving fundamental aspects of Australian electoral integrity to the arbitrary whims of corporate terms of service. In one damning instance, the YouTube Legal Support Team flatly rejected an AEC request to restrict content, stating, "we didn't find grounds to restrict the URL(s) at issue under our legal policies," despite the AEC citing potential breaches of both Queensland privacy law and the Commonwealth Electoral Act. The AEC was then advised to "try to resolve any issues directly with the creator of the content" or "pursue legal action," exposing the AEC as utterly toothless in directly enforcing Australian law.</p>
<p><strong>2. Reactive and Overwhelmed Response to Pervasive Misinformation:</strong><br />
The sheer volume of content referral emails, particularly with Twitter and Meta, indicates an electoral environment plagued by widespread "misinformation," "disinformation," "impersonation," and "unauthorised communications." The AEC functions merely as a reactive reporting service, submitting a relentless stream of "requests" and "referrals" into corporate black boxes. This reactive approach, where the AEC must wait for platforms to "review" or "complete" actions, guarantees that harmful, misleading, or illegal content remains visible and influences voters during critical election periods. The constant "Your Request... has been received" emails highlight a process of passive submission rather than authoritative demand.</p>
<p><strong>3. Direct Admission of Vulnerability to Foreign Interference:</strong><br />
The AEC's own "Electoral Communications Escalation Scenarios" document contains a staggering admission: "Detection and attribution [of foreign interference] can be time and resource intensive, while disinformation strategies are cheap and agile." This is a public confession of the Australian government's severe incapacity and under-resourcing to effectively combat sophisticated, potentially state-sponsored, attacks on its democratic process. It suggests a known vulnerability that was not adequately addressed.</p>
<p><strong>4. Foreign Corporations Dictating Terms and Strategy:</strong><br />
The humiliating extent of the AEC's subservience is starkly evident in documents like the "Electoral Communications Escalation Scenarios" explicitly stating "Updated by Google," demonstrating that foreign corporations are directly shaping the frameworks intended to protect Australian elections. Furthermore, Meta's "How Meta is Preparing for the 2022 Australian Election" is presented as a released document, yet it is merely a corporate public relations piece outlining Meta's unilateral actions and significant internal investments. This underscores Meta's self-appointed role as an independent arbiter of Australian elections, without apparent direct control or directive from the AEC.</p>
<p><strong>5. Repeated Failures in Content Integrity:</strong><br />
The documents detail a litany of severe electoral malfeasance requiring external intervention:<br />
*   False claims of widespread election fraud, including "dead people are enrolled to vote" and "identification is not required to enrol to vote," being disseminated on platforms like TikTok.<br />
*   Direct impersonation of the AEC itself on TikTok.<br />
*   Illicit filming inside polling places and counting centres, including AEC staff without consent, coupled with "disinformation accusing the AEC of rigging the election."<br />
*   Unauthorised electoral advertising and communications, a direct breach of the Commonwealth Electoral Act, requiring AEC to report to platforms.<br />
The sheer frequency and gravity of these incidents reveal a profound breakdown in information integrity during the election, with the AEC relegated to merely flagging issues for companies to address on their own terms.</p>

                  <h3>Document Summary: FOI Request LEX3037 Released Documents Schedule</h3>
<p>This document is the "SCHEDULE OF RELEASED DOCUMENTS" pertaining to FOI Request LEX3037, detailing the correspondence between the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) and major technology companies (Meta, Twitter, Google, Microsoft, and TikTok) concerning the 2022 federal election. The request specifically sought communications from 28 January 2022 onwards about compliance with the <em>Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918</em> or related to the election.</p>
<p>The schedule lists over 100 individual documents, predominantly emails, but also including letters, meeting agendas, and an "Electoral Communications escalations scenarios" guide dated 29 October 2021. The correspondence spans from June 2021 (for some foundational communications) primarily through to June 2022, capturing the lead-up to and immediate aftermath of the 2022 election.</p>
<p>Key themes and types of interactions revealed in the document descriptions include:<br />
*   <strong>Proactive Engagement:</strong> Regular meetings and engagements, often involving the AEC's Electoral Integrity Assurance Taskforce (EIAT), as evidenced by numerous "Agenda" and "Electoral Integrity Taskforce engagement" entries.<br />
*   <strong>Content Referrals and Management:</strong> Extensive email exchanges detailing content referrals to platforms (Google, TikTok, Twitter, Meta) for issues such as "electoral misinformation," "electoral disinformation," "content removal," "AEC Impersonation Referral," "Polling Place Video," "privacy issues," and "abuse."<br />
*   <strong>Compliance and Integrity:</strong> Discussions around "online authorisations," "disclosure entities," and general "election integrity briefing" sessions.<br />
*   <strong>Escalation Processes:</strong> The repeated inclusion of the "Electoral Communications escalations scenarios" guide underscores the structured approach to managing potential issues.</p>
<h3>Relevance to the FOI Request Overview</h3>
<p>This document directly fulfills and elaborates on the FOI request overview. It provides the granular detail of the "correspondence from early 2022 between the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) and major tech companies" (Meta, Twitter, Google, Microsoft, and TikTok). It explicitly lists the "Electoral Communications Escalation Scenarios" guide and numerous instances of "extensive communication."</p>
<p>Furthermore, the schedule confirms and exemplifies the AEC's "proactive engagement—primarily through its Electoral Integrity Assurance Taskforce—with these platforms." The recurring descriptions of "content referrals," "electoral misinformation," and "election integrity" discussions directly illustrate the "collaboration focused on identifying, monitoring, and addressing electoral misinformation, disinformation, and non-compliant content through direct communication channels and content referrals, thereby safeguarding election integrity." The document serves as the core evidence demonstrating the scope and nature of this critical interaction.</p>

Electoral communications escalation scenarios  

Commonwealth law 
infringed/issues 
Policy:  

FI is likely to be a break of 
platforms’ own terms of use 

Operational: 

Division 92, Part 5.2 
Criminal Code Act 1995  

Detection and attribution can 
be time and resource 
intensive, while 
disinformation strategies are 
cheap and agile. 

Scenario  Description 
5 

Foreign 
interference  

This scenario 
notes the 
difference 
between the 
legislated and 
policy definitions 
of “foreign 
interference”, and 
the differing 
approaches taken 
by policy agencies 
(CFICC), and 
operational 
agencies/bodies 
(including the CFI 
Taskforce). 

Examples 
Policy:  

Social media accounts 
that appear to: 

•  amplify, then 

consistently promote 
divisive political 
positions designed to 
fragment the 
electorate, 
•  target specific 

demographics within 
the electorate with 
messaging designed to 
influence voting 
behaviour. 

Operational:  

To be actionable under 
s92, FI activity must meet 
the elements specified in 
s92, notably: 1. Conduct; 
2. done on half 
of/directed by a Foreign 
Principal; 3. to achieve 
one of the four stated 
intentions; 4. done 
covertly/deceptively/with 
menace/etc 

6 

Electoral 
communication 
containing threats 
of terrorist action 

Electoral communication 
threatening terrorist 
action against polling 
booths and/or voters. 

Anti-terrorism laws and 
powers activated.

Electoral communications escalation scenarios  

Scenario  Description 
7 
Anonymous 
electoral 
communication 
(other than a paid 
advertisement) 
without 
authorisation 

Examples 
Anonymous 
communication 
promoting informal 
voting  

Commonwealth law 
infringed/issues 
Depends on who is 
communicating the matter 
as to whether the 
communication must be 
authorised under the 
Commonwealth Electoral 
Act 1918.  An electoral 
communication must be 
authorised if it is for, or on 
behalf of, a disclosure entity 
(i.e. a candidate, political 
party or other person or 
group that is required to 
report electoral expenditure 
or donations to the 
Electoral Commission under 
Part XX of the Electoral Act).

Electoral 
communication 
(including a paid 
electoral ad) that 
is defamatory  

Third party authorises a 
paid advertisement that 
defames a candidate so 
as to affect public 
perception of the 
integrity of the 
candidate, party, election 
or political system.  

Affected individual or 
organisation can take legal 
action, however, issue may 
be to stop the spread of 
disinformation during an 
election campaign. 

Electoral 
communication 
(including a paid 
electoral ad) 
brings a 
Commonwealth 
agency into 
disrepute  

Third party authorises a 
paid advertisement that 
defames a 
Commonwealth agency

                    <h2>Summary of Document: "Electoral communications escalation scenarios"</h2>
<p>This document, prepared by the Australian Electoral Commission's (AEC) Electoral Integrity Assurance Taskforce (EIAT) on 29 October 2021, outlines 11 distinct "Electoral Communications Escalation Scenarios." Each scenario describes a specific type of problematic electoral communication, provides examples, and references the relevant Commonwealth law or policy issue. The scenarios cover a range of electoral integrity concerns, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Unauthorised Paid Electoral Advertising (Scenario 1):</strong> Electoral ads lacking proper authorisation, as required by Section 321D of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918.</li>
<li><strong>Misleading Voter Information (Scenario 2):</strong> Communications likely to mislead electors on how to cast a vote (Section 329, Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918), such as incorrect advice on candidate withdrawal or formal voting.</li>
<li><strong>Impersonation of Commonwealth Officials/Entities (Scenario 3):</strong> False representation as a Commonwealth body or official (Section 150.1, Criminal Code Act 1995).</li>
<li><strong>Foreign Influence and Interference (Scenarios 4 &amp; 5):</strong> Communications by or on behalf of foreign persons/entities (Foreign Influence Transparency Scheme Act 2018) and more broadly, foreign interference activity as defined by the Criminal Code Act 1995 (Division 92, Part 5.2), including covert attempts to influence voting.</li>
<li><strong>Threats of Terrorist Action (Scenario 6):</strong> Electoral communications threatening violence against polling booths or voters.</li>
<li><strong>Anonymous Communications (Scenario 7):</strong> Unauthorised communications from disclosure entities.</li>
<li><strong>Defamation and Disrepute (Scenarios 8 &amp; 9):</strong> Communications defaming candidates or bringing Commonwealth agencies into disrepute, affecting public perception of election integrity.</li>
<li><strong>Hate Speech (Scenario 10):</strong> Vilification based on protected characteristics, with potential relevance to the Online Safety Act 2021.</li>
<li><strong>Breaches of Platform Policy (Scenario 11):</strong> Electoral communications that may not breach Commonwealth law but violate platform terms (e.g., spam, false news).</li>
</ul>
<p>The document serves as a structured guide for identifying and classifying various forms of potentially harmful or illegal online electoral content.</p>
<h2>Relevance to FOI Request LEX3037</h2>
<p>This document is central to FOI request LEX3037, which concerns correspondence between the AEC and major tech companies regarding compliance with electoral law and the 2022 federal election. The FOI request explicitly mentions the release of an "Electoral Communications Escalation Scenarios" guide prepared by the AEC's Electoral Integrity Assurance Taskforce (EIAT).</p>
<p>This document <em>is</em> that guide. Its relevance is critical as it outlines the specific types of content and legal/policy considerations that formed the basis for the AEC's "proactive engagement" with tech platforms. It details the criteria the EIAT used to "identify, monitor, and address electoral misinformation, disinformation, and non-compliant content" through "direct communication channels and content referrals." The scenarios within the document directly informed the AEC's efforts to safeguard election integrity by providing a framework for identifying problematic communications and the grounds for seeking their removal or intervention by tech companies leading up to the 2022 federal election.</p>

Hi Louise, 

Great to chat with you just just now and hello to the team. To recap our conversation:  

If the AEC has any legal removal requests please:  

 
 

Lodge the request at 
Send a note to me and cc

and 

 so we can ensure it is attended to promptly.  

If the AEC has a concern about any content or activity that is not a legal request but concerning anyway:  

  Please email me directly at 
 

From here I will be able to escalate to our Trust and Safety team or others as required. 

or ring on 

 if urgent.  

Backup contact if I am out of office is 
so someone will pick it up. If on a weekend/after hours feel free to call or text my mobile.  

google.com which is the whole Google Australia public policy team, 

The below links may also be of interest:  

 Google Civics Training Centre for candidates, parties, and campaigners including election security tutorials 
and tools. Google runs a training program in Australia for Members, Senators, staff, candidates and 
parties on how to use these tools.  

 Google&#39;s political advertising transparency report for Australia and Google&#39;s political advertising policy for 
Australia. Political ads are those that feature a political party, current elected officeholder or candidate

 A blog post from our Threat Analysis Group outlining some work during the most recent US Presidential 

election and the latest TAG report.  

If the team would like a refresher briefing on the political transparency program, please let me know.  

How to flag an issue on our platforms (all links publicly shareable).  

  Report Google Search results (organic)  
  Report Google Ads (paid ads at the top)  
  Report YouTube content 

From memory last election the AEC did include some of these links on its site to help the public know what to do if it 
saw concerning content on our platforms ‐‐ feel free to include them again if useful (we can assist with more

Dear Andrew and the AEC team, I hope this email finds you well and feeling rejuvenated after a summer
vacation?

With an eye to the upcoming Federal election, we&#39;d like to offer you a briefing on Google&#39;s election integrity
work from colleagues that have worked on elections in other countries. Just wanted to gauge your interest in
such a briefing and if so, when you would like the briefing to take place.

Kind regards

                    <p>This document is an automated confirmation email from the YouTube Legal Support Team to the Australian Electoral Commission's (AEC) "Authorisation Section," dated April 25, 2022. It acknowledges receipt of a request from the AEC to Google (YouTube's parent company) and provides a reference number for the complaint.</p>
<p>Its relevance to FOI request LEX3037 is that it serves as direct evidence of the communication channels between the AEC's Electoral Integrity Assurance Taskforce and major tech companies, specifically Google (YouTube), during early 2022. This email confirms the AEC's active engagement in making referrals or requests to platforms concerning electoral content, likely in line with their efforts to identify, monitor, and address electoral misinformation, disinformation, or non-compliant content leading up to the 2022 federal election.

                    <p>This document is an email exchange from April 2022 between Meg Mackie, a Government Lawyer at the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC), and a Google Australia Government Affairs and Public Policy Manager. It details the AEC's specific request for the removal of three YouTube videos due to their alleged breach of s 321D(5) of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918, which pertains to unauthorised electoral matter. The AEC identifies the videos as containing electoral content intended to influence voting, depicting a candidate from "freedom-friendly parties," and being unauthorised. The correspondence confirms Google's receipt of the complaint, the AEC's internal policy for such submissions, and Google's subsequent action: the removal of two of the three flagged videos, with the third remaining under review.</p>
<p>This document is highly relevant to the FOI request (LEX3037) as it provides concrete evidence of the AEC's "proactive engagement" and "direct communication channels and content referrals" with major tech companies, specifically Google/YouTube. It directly illustrates the Electoral Integrity Assurance Taskforce's efforts to identify, monitor, and address "non-compliant content" (unauthorised electoral matter in this case) to safeguard election integrity during the lead-up to the 2022 federal election, aligning perfectly with the FOI request's overview of the AEC's collaboration with platforms like Google.</p>

of s 44 Invasion of Privacy Act (QLD) (which is an indictable offence  

liable on conviction to a maximum penalty of 40 penalty units or  

imprisonment for 2 years):

•      5:49 – seen recording a conversation with a QLD police officer,

 no statement about consent to record.

•      3:25 - seen recording a phone call with a journalist (Channel 7 news) –  

states at 3:05 “I’m not going to be telling them I’m recording, because  

they’ll be recording it”

This is also a potential breach of Google&amp;#39;s &amp;#39;Respect Others&amp;#39; Term of  

Service, which requires that users &amp;quot;comply with applicable laws&amp;quot;  

and &amp;quot;respect the rights of others, including privacy... rights.&amp;quot;

The video is also not authorised in accordance with s 321D of the  

Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 (Cth), a civil penalty provision.

The AEC has previously written to the video creator,

 warning 

to authorise 

social media accounts and website.

gov_quote: 3:05 - “I’m not going to be telling them I’m recording, because

Additionally, the video is also not authorised in accordance with s 321D of

                    <h3>Document Summary</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sender/Recipient:</strong> An email from the Australian Electoral Commission's (AEC) Electoral Integrity Assurance Taskforce (EIAT) to the Google (YouTube Legal Support) team.</li>
<li><strong>Date:</strong> May 20, 2022.</li>
<li><strong>Content:</strong> The AEC is referring specific video links to Google/YouTube for review, noting that one link is a re-uploaded version of content previously reported. The email includes a reference number for the complaint, and the YouTube Legal Support Team confirms receipt.</li>
<li><strong>Purpose:</strong> The AEC is requesting Google/YouTube to include the newly identified, re-uploaded video in an existing content referral for review.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Relevance to FOI Request (LEX3037)</h3>
<p>This document is highly relevant as it exemplifies the AEC's proactive engagement and direct communication channels with major tech companies, as described in the FOI request overview:<br />
*   <strong>Direct Communication:</strong> It demonstrates the AEC's "direct communication channels" with Google (a major tech company) for content referrals.<br />
*   <strong>Content Referral:</strong> It shows the process of "content referrals" by the AEC to address potentially problematic online material, including the proactive identification of re-uploaded content.<br />
*   <strong>Electoral Integrity Assurance Taskforce (EIAT):</strong> The sender being the EIAT (via the Defending Democracy Unit within its branch) confirms the involvement of the taskforce in these efforts.<br />
*   <strong>Timing:</strong> The May 2022 date aligns with the "early 2022" timeframe of correspondence concerning the 2022 federal election, focusing on compliance and content moderation.</p>

                    <h3>Document Summary</h3>
<p>This document comprises an email exchange from May 20, 2022—the day before Australia's 2022 federal election—between Google Australia, the YouTube Legal Support Team, and the Australian Electoral Commission's (AEC) Electoral Integrity Assurance Taskforce (EIAT). The core of the exchange is an urgent "request to Google" from the AEC regarding an unspecified matter, likely related to electoral content or compliance. Google Australia acknowledges receipt of this request, confirms it was sent to their legal team for urgent review, and states that a response has been provided to the EIAT. The email chain also includes an automated acknowledgment from the YouTube Legal Support Team for the original "request to Google," providing a reference number.</p>
<h3>Relevance to FOI Request LEX3037</h3>
<p>This document is highly relevant to FOI request LEX3037, which seeks information on the AEC's correspondence with major tech companies (including Google) regarding electoral law compliance and the 2022 federal election. Specifically, it demonstrates:<br />
*   <strong>Direct Communication Channels:</strong> It confirms the existence and active use of direct communication channels between the AEC's EIAT and Google/YouTube.<br />
*   <strong>Proactive Engagement:</strong> The AEC's "request to Google" highlights its proactive engagement with platforms to address specific concerns leading up to the election.<br />
*   <strong>Content Referrals/Urgent Review:</strong> The internal referral of the AEC's request to Google's legal team for "urgent review" and the subsequent confirmation of a response indicate the process for handling potentially non-compliant or concerning electoral content.<br />
*   <strong>Safeguarding Election Integrity:</strong> The timing of the exchange (the day before the election) underscores the real-time, high-priority nature of these interactions in safeguarding election integrity by addressing issues promptly.</p>

                    <pre><code class="language-markdown">This document details a specific interaction between the Australian Electoral Commission's (AEC) Electoral Integrity Assurance Taskforce (EIAT) / Defending Democracy Unit and Google (including YouTube's legal support team) on May 20-21, 2022. It concerns an AEC request for content restriction of specific URLs on YouTube. Google/YouTube reviewed the request but declined to restrict the content, stating they &quot;didn't find grounds to restrict the URL(s) at issue under our legal policies,&quot; and suggested the AEC pursue direct resolution with content creators or legal action.

**Relevance to FOI Request (LEX3037):** This correspondence is a direct example of the &quot;extensive communication&quot; and &quot;direct communication channels and content referrals&quot; between the AEC and major tech companies, specifically Google, as described in the FOI request overview. It demonstrates the AEC's proactive engagement through its Electoral Integrity Assurance Taskforce during the 2022 federal election to address potential non-compliant content, even when a content removal request is not successful.

                    <h3>Document Summary: AEC Content Referral to Google</h3>
<p>This document comprises an email chain from April 29 to May 1, 2022, detailing a specific instance of the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) referring content to Google for alleged breaches of YouTube's Electoral Misinformation policy.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Referral:</strong> On April 29, 2022, the AEC's Digital and Social Media Manager, Alex Morris, formally referred a YouTube video to Google, citing a breach of the platform's electoral misinformation policy.</li>
<li><strong>Google's Action:</strong> Google's Government Affairs and Public Policy Manager acknowledged the referral, stating the information had been passed to their legal team for review. Google also requested the AEC formalize the request by replying to an original receipt email for "proper process."</li>
<li><strong>Resolution:</strong> By May 1, 2022, Google confirmed that the problematic video had been "blocked in Australia" and that a formal notification of this action had been sent to the AEC.</li>
<li><strong>AEC Monitoring:</strong> The AEC's Electoral Integrity Assurance Taskforce (EIAT) and Social Media team were included in the correspondence, indicating their role in monitoring such content moderation requests.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Relevance to FOI Request (LEX3037)</h3>
<p>This document is highly relevant to FOI request LEX3037 as it provides a concrete example of the AEC's proactive engagement with major tech companies, specifically Google (YouTube), during the 2022 federal election. It illustrates the operational effectiveness of the "Electoral Integrity Assurance Taskforce" in identifying and addressing electoral misinformation through direct communication channels and content referrals, directly aligning with the FOI request's focus on safeguarding election integrity by addressing non-compliant content.</p>

Hi Julie,

Hope you have been well and had a chance to rest since the election.

The TikTok Public Policy team will be in Canberra 1 July, and I was wondering whether it would be an 
opportune time for us to have a post-election catch up and potentially discuss the Statement of Intent 
and upcoming state elections. 

As you are aware we have been working closely with Evan&#39;s team and the EIIF as well, so we&#39;d be 
happy to meet with everyone together but I thought I would reach out to you first.

Let me know your thoughts!

                    <p>This document comprises an email exchange from May and June 2022 between the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC), specifically Julie Igglesden (A/g Director, Electoral Integrity and Communications Branch/Defending Democracy Unit/EIAT) and Evan Ekin-Smyth, and a representative from TikTok.</p>
<p>The correspondence details:<br />
*   A proposal from TikTok for a post-election catch-up meeting with the AEC's Electoral Integrity Assurance Taskforce (EIAT) and Evan Ekin-Smyth's team on July 1, 2022.<br />
*   The primary agenda for this meeting includes discussing a "Statement of Intent" and preparations for upcoming state elections, indicating ongoing collaboration beyond the 2022 federal election.<br />
*   Prior communication on May 21, 2022, concerning "election content and postal rules" and a clarification regarding "secure telephone voting eligibility," though the content of the "Update regarding election content and postal rules" email is largely redacted.</p>
<p><strong>Relevance to FOI Request (LEX3037):</strong><br />
This document directly supports the FOI request overview by demonstrating:<br />
*   <strong>Continued Proactive Engagement:</strong> It confirms ongoing, post-election correspondence between the AEC's Electoral Integrity Assurance Taskforce (EIAT) and a major tech company (TikTok), aligning with the AEC's stated proactive engagement with platforms.<br />
*   <strong>Safeguarding Election Integrity:</strong> The discussions about "election content," "postal rules," and a "Statement of Intent" underscore the AEC's continued focus on managing online content and ensuring compliance with electoral law for both federal and future state elections.<br />
*   <strong>Collaboration Mechanisms:</strong> The mention of a "Statement of Intent" reveals a specific mechanism through which the AEC seeks to formalize or guide its engagement with tech platforms on electoral matters, extending the scope of collaboration beyond direct content referrals.<br />
*   <strong>Personnel and Units:</strong> It identifies key AEC personnel (Julie Igglesden, Evan Ekin-Smyth) and branches (Electoral Integrity and Communications Branch, Defending Democracy Unit, EIAT) involved in these high-level discussions with tech companies.</p>

With regards to the agenda - I will give an update on TikTok&#39;s election prepardness work and support from the 

AEC so far (Election Guide, PSA&#39;s etc.). Itd also be useful if AEC could give any updates/or information 

regarding potential threats/risks to the Election which we can consider for our own preparation. 

May end up only being a 30 min meeting, but its good to have a bit of extra time at the end in case we need it! 

Kind regards

Thanks 

, appreciate you making those changes.

Overseas travel - What a fantastic novelty at this point!
Of course happy to work with the availability of the team, I’m conscious that we may have an election
announcement by that week, and we will do our very best from this side to keep our appointments!

Looking at week commencing 4 April, are we just working with Aus based staff? If so, can I suggest 11am on
Tuesday 5 April, for an hour via Teams?

Cheers
Julie

Hi Julie, 

All actioned - yes we are certainly open to having another prep meeting prior to the election. 

Could we aim for first week April instead? My team will be overseas for a week at the end of March so it might 
be tricky for us then. 

Kind regards

Those referrals coming from our Authorisations team will be the legal ones, and those from Social Media team
more likely those against your Terms of Use.

Would actually be great for us as AEC to catch up with you once more before the election is announced? (let’s
say this month?) Just to run through everything and make sure we’re all sorted.

Hi Julie, 

Hope you are well. 

I was going through our whitelist for Australian Government agencies using our dedicated reporting channels 
and noticed we only have two email addresses registered for the AEC: 

eiat@aec.gov.au
Your email

We discussed this almost a year ago now so I just wanted to make sure the AEC didnt have any other email 
addresses/teams that would likely be sending TikTok escalations. We will still respond to all escalations in our 
govreport inbox but its helps us address the issue more quickly if we already have confirmation as to who is 
sending the request. 

Kind regards

                    <h3>Document Summary</h3>
<p>This document comprises email correspondence between the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC), specifically its Electoral Integrity Assurance Taskforce (EIAT) and related branches (Authorisation Section, Social Media), and TikTok representatives, spanning from March to April 2022. The core of the communication revolves around establishing and optimizing direct communication channels for addressing electoral integrity concerns ahead of the 2022 federal election. Key aspects include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Dedicated Reporting Channels:</strong> TikTok initiated contact to confirm and update the AEC's "whitelisted" email addresses for their "dedicated reporting channels," indicating a system designed for expedited handling of government referrals.</li>
<li><strong>Categorization of Referrals:</strong> The AEC clarified that referrals originating from its <code>authorisationsection@aec.gov.au</code> would pertain to "legal" matters, while those from <code>socialmedia@aec.gov.au</code> would more likely concern content violating TikTok's "Terms of Use," demonstrating a structured approach to content moderation.</li>
<li><strong>Pre-Election Coordination Meeting:</strong> Both parties agreed to hold a preparatory meeting on April 5, 2022, to ensure readiness and alignment. The proposed agenda for this meeting included updates on TikTok's election preparedness work (e.g., Election Guide, PSAs) and the AEC providing insights on potential threats or risks to the election.</li>
<li><strong>Proactive Engagement:</strong> The correspondence illustrates a proactive, collaborative effort to refine operational mechanisms for identifying, monitoring, and addressing potential electoral integrity issues.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Relevance to FOI Request LEX3037</h3>
<p>This document is highly relevant to FOI request LEX3037, as it provides direct evidence of the AEC's proactive engagement with major tech companies, specifically TikTok, regarding compliance with electoral law and safeguarding the integrity of the 2022 federal election. It explicitly demonstrates:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Correspondence from early 2022:</strong> The emails fall within the specified timeframe (March-April 2022).</li>
<li><strong>Engagement with a major tech company:</strong> Clear communication between the AEC and TikTok.</li>
<li><strong>Focus on electoral law compliance and election integrity:</strong> Discussions center on election preparedness, potential threats, and content moderation.</li>
<li><strong>AEC's proactive role (Electoral Integrity Assurance Taskforce):</strong> The involvement of EIAT and the initiative to clarify and streamline reporting mechanisms highlight the AEC's strategic efforts.</li>
<li><strong>Collaboration and direct communication channels:</strong> The establishment of "dedicated reporting channels" and the scheduling of pre-election coordination meetings confirm the collaborative approach for content referrals and addressing misinformation, disinformation, and non-compliant content.</li>

 [SEC=OFFICIAL] 

Hi team, 

Our social media team have last night identified 
reviewing it, we’ve identified two issues: 

 from the 

TikTok account. After 

1)  7 April is not a deadline for enrolling to vote or updating your enrolment. The enrolment cutoff date has not 
yet been announced (it will be announced at the same time the election is called). This means the post could 
mislead about the deadline for enrolling to vote, potentially disenfranchising young voters.  

2)  The 

account is not authorised.  

Please let me know if we can provide any more information here. Happy to discuss further.  

Thanks and kind regards, 

Alex Morris | Digital and Social Media Manager

The email identifies two issues with content posted on a TikTok account:<br />
1.  The post incorrectly stated April 7 as an enrolment deadline, which the AEC notes could mislead and potentially disenfranchise young voters, as the actual cut-off date had not yet been announced.<br />

Falsely claiming that Australia’s 2010 Federal Election was won by a smaller margin than the number of

Falsely claiming that dead people are enrolled to vote

Falsely claiming that one specific party is engaged in widespread electoral fraud 

The video is also in breach of Section 321D of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 as it does not contain both a

                    <h2>Document Summary and FOI Relevance</h2>
<h3>Document Summary</h3>
<p>This document is an email dated 29 April 2022, from Alex Morris, Digital and Social Media Manager at the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC), to Jenny Xue (implied TikTok contact) and the AEC's Electoral Integrity Assurance Taskforce (EIAT). The email serves as a formal content referral regarding a specific video on TikTok. The AEC asserts the video breaches TikTok’s "Integrity and Authenticity policy" by making multiple false claims, including:<br />
*   Falsely claiming the 2010 Federal Election was won by a smaller margin than alleged multiple votes.<br />
*   Falsely claiming dead people are enrolled to vote.<br />
*   Falsely claiming identification is not required to enrol to vote.<br />
*   Falsely claiming one specific party is engaged in widespread electoral fraud.<br />
The email further states the video breaches Section 321D of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 due to the absence of both a written and spoken authorisation message. The AEC requests swift action given the serious nature of the claims.</p>
<h3>Relevance to FOI Request (LEX3037)</h3>
<p>This document is highly relevant to FOI request LEX3037 as it provides a concrete example of the "extensive communication" and "proactive engagement" between the AEC (specifically involving its Electoral Integrity Assurance Taskforce) and major tech companies, such as TikTok, during early 2022. It directly illustrates the AEC's efforts to:<br />
*   <strong>Identify and monitor:</strong> The AEC actively found a video on TikTok containing problematic content.<br />
*   <strong>Address misinformation/disinformation:</strong> The email details specific false claims (misinformation/disinformation) the video propagated.<br />
*   <strong>Address non-compliant content:</strong> It highlights the breach of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 (Section 321D) regarding authorisation.<br />
*   <strong>Utilize direct communication channels and content referrals:</strong> The email itself is a direct referral to TikTok requesting action.<br />
*   <strong>Safeguard election integrity:</strong> The underlying purpose of the referral is to remove or address content that could undermine public trust in the electoral process, thereby safeguarding the integrity of the 2022 federal election.</p>

Hi team,

We’ve been made aware of a TikTok account impersonating the AEC, which breaches TikTok’s
Integrity and Authenticity policy by impersonating an entity.

Grateful if this can be swiftly addressed.

Hi team,

We’ve been referred the following video which was filmed inside a polling place without permission,
potentially identifies an AEC staff member and contains disinformation accusing the AEC of rigging the
election. We would appreciate swift action on removing this, particularly given the filming was not
permitted and includes a staff member. The video appears to breach both the Integrity and
Authenticity Policy and Privacy, Personal Data, &amp; Personally Identifiable Info Policy.

                    <h3>Document Summary</h3>
<p>This document is an email from Pat Callanan of the Australian Electoral Commission's (AEC) Communications Section, dated May 21, 2022 (election day). It is addressed to "Social Media" (implicitly TikTok, given the video link) and carbon-copied to various AEC sections, including the Electoral Integrity Assurance Taskforce (EIAT). The email refers a video posted on TikTok that was filmed inside a polling place without permission, potentially identifies an AEC staff member, and contains disinformation accusing the AEC of rigging the election. The AEC requests swift action to remove the video, stating it breaches "Integrity and Authenticity Policy" and "Privacy, Personal Data, &amp; Personally Identifiable Info Policy" (likely referring to the platform's policies).</p>
<h3>Relevance to FOI Request LEX3037</h3>
<p>This document directly exemplifies the AEC's proactive engagement and "Electoral Communications Escalation Scenarios" outlined in FOI request LEX3037. It demonstrates a specific instance of the AEC's Electoral Integrity Assurance Taskforce (EIAT) using direct communication channels with a major tech company (TikTok) to:<br />
*   Identify and monitor electoral misinformation/disinformation ("accusing the AEC of rigging the election").<br />
*   Address non-compliant content (filming without permission, identifying staff).<br />
*   Request content removal, thereby safeguarding election integrity during the 2022 federal election.</p>
<p>This email serves as tangible evidence of the collaboration and content referral mechanisms between the AEC and tech platforms described in the FOI request overview.</p>

<p>This document is an email dated May 21, 2022, from TikTok's Trust &amp; Safety team to an Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) contact (referred to as "Social Media"). The email confirms receipt of a report from the AEC regarding a "Polling Place Video" and states that TikTok's teams have received the report and will conduct a review, promising to follow up once completed.</p>
<p><strong>Relevance to FOI Request LEX3037:</strong><br />
This email directly illustrates the "extensive communication" and "direct communication channels and content referrals" between the AEC and major tech companies, as highlighted in the FOI request overview. It provides specific evidence of the AEC, likely via its Electoral Integrity Assurance Taskforce, proactively engaging with TikTok during the 2022 federal election period to report and address potentially non-compliant content or electoral misinformation/disinformation related to polling places. TikTok's response confirms the operational aspect of this collaboration, demonstrating the mechanism by which the AEC sought to safeguard election integrity by flagging concerning content for platform review.</p>

TIkTok - AEC staff being recorded without consent or awareness [SEC=OFFICIAL]

Hello team,
We have been sent the following tiktok. This video records one of our staff members without their
awareness or consent in side of a counting centre. We would ask that this be removed as it breaks
privacy rules and identifies our staff.

Grateful if this can be swiftly addressed.

Cheers,
Bella

This document is an email from Isabella McCormick, Digital &amp; Social Media Officer at the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC), to TikTok dated May 23, 2022. The email requests the swift removal of a TikTok video that recorded an AEC staff member without their awareness or consent inside a counting centre. The request cites a breach of privacy rules and the identification of AEC staff as reasons for removal.

### Relevance to FOI Request LEX3037

This document is highly relevant to FOI request LEX3037 as it exemplifies the direct engagement and communication channels established between the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) and major tech companies, specifically TikTok, during the 2022 federal election period. It demonstrates the AEC's proactive efforts, likely through its Electoral Integrity Assurance Taskforce, to address &quot;non-compliant content&quot; on social media platforms. While the specific issue is a privacy breach and unauthorized recording of staff rather than misinformation, it falls under the broader remit of safeguarding election integrity by managing content that impacts AEC operations and personnel. This aligns with the FOI request's description of AEC's collaboration with platforms for content referrals and direct communication to maintain election integrity.

                    <h3>Document Summary &amp; Relevance to FOI Request LEX3037</h3>
<p>This document consists primarily of blank pages, with an email footer and signature block appearing on page 9. The footer identifies the sender as a "Policy Associate, Regional Co-Lead" from "TwitterOpen" and includes standard email disclaimers. Repeated redaction markings, <code>s 47F</code>, are present on page 9, indicating that personal information has been withheld under the FOI Act.</p>
<p>The document's relevance to FOI request LEX3037 is that it confirms the existence of correspondence originating from Twitter, one of the major tech companies specified in the request overview. Although the substantive content of the communication has been redacted (resulting in the blank pages), the presence of Twitter's branding and an employee's signature block demonstrates that this document was part of the "correspondence from early 2022 between the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) and major tech companies, including... Twitter," as sought by the FOI request regarding electoral law compliance and election integrity. The blank pages suggest significant information related to the specific content of the communication has been withheld.</p>

NEWSROOM POST – STRICTLY EMBARGOED UNTIL 12.01AM AEDT 15 MARCH 2022

How Meta is Preparing for the 2022 Australian Election
By Josh Machin, Head of Public Policy for Meta Australia

● Meta has been preparing for this year’s Australian election for a long time and will be using a
comprehensive strategy to combat misinformation, election interference, and other forms of
abuse on our platforms.

● We’re expanding our third-party fact-checking program in Australia to include RMIT FactLab.
They’ll join Agence France Presse and Australian Associated Press to review and rate content.
We’ll also be providing one-off grants to all our fact-checkers to increase their capacity in the
lead up to the election.

● We’re also working with the Australian Associated Press to re-run the “Check the Facts” media
literacy campaign in three other languages - into Vietnamese, Simplified Chinese and Arabic to
extend the benefits of the campaign even further.

With the Australian Election set to take place in the coming months, Meta has been preparing for them
for a long time. We’ve been involved in more than 200 elections around the world since 2017, and we’ve
learned key lessons from each one about where to focus our teams, technologies, and investments so
they will have the greatest impact. Here are some of the ways that we’re already promoting safety and
integrity across our platforms ahead of this year’s Australian Election.

Combating Abuse, Misinformation, and Election Interference Using a Comprehensive Approach

We’ve made significant investments in safety and security, including approximately $5 billion/ $AU7
billion in 2021 alone and now have more than 40,000 people around the world working on safety and
security. These investments have allowed us to build our ability to reduce the likelihood of abuses -
including election interference, misinformation and online harms - from happening in the first place,
rather than just addressing them when they occur. For this year’s Australian election, this work will
include:

● Announcing a new Australian Fact-Checker. We know the importance of ensuring Australians
have access to reliable information about the election in Australia. Therefore, we are pleased to
announce the expansion of our third party fact checking program in Australia today. From March
21, RMIT FactLab will join Meta’s global independent fact checking program in reviewing and
rating the accuracy of content in the lead up to the 2022 Australian Election, alongside Agence
France Presse and the Australian Associated Press. We&#39;ll also be providing one-off grants to all
our fact-checkers to increase their capacity in the lead up to the election. Our fact checkers work
to reduce the spread of misinformation across Meta’s services. When they rate something as

Released under the FOI ActReleased under the FOI Act


--- Page 2 ---

false, we significantly reduce its distribution so fewer people see it. We also notify people who
try to share something rated as false and add a warning label with a link to a debunking article.
● Russell Skelton, Director of RMIT FactLab said, “We see this as a really important public service.
If we can play a role in preventing the dissemination of misinformation on social media that has
the potential to mislead or harm, then we see that as providing a really critical service.”

● We are also working with expert organisations such as First Draft to increase monitoring for
misinformation in the lead-up to the election and publish related analyses and reporting on their
website. First Draft will also be providing pre-election training for Australian journalists on how
to identify and prevent amplifying mis and dis information.

● Empowering People to Identify False News. Since we know it’s not enough to just limit or

remove harmful or misleading electoral misinformation that people see, we’re giving people
more context about a post so they can make an informed decision on what to read, trust and
share. We have invested in dedicated Australian initiatives including:

○ Working with the Australian Associated Press to launch an education and awareness
campaign comprising a series of short videos modelling how people can recognise and
avoid misinformation by taking simple steps to &#39;Check the Facts&#39;. The campaign will run
again this April and will include, for the first time, content translated in three other
languages - Vietnamese, Simplified Chinese and Arabic to extend the benefits of the
campaign even further.

○ Partnering with First Draft to develop the “Don’t be a Misinfluencer” campaign on

Facebook and Instagram to help creators and influencers to share tips for spotting false
news.

Security and election interference

● Combatting Influence Operations. We have specialised global teams to identify and take action
against threats to the election, including signs of coordinated inauthentic behaviour across our
apps. We are also coordinating with the Government&#39;s election integrity assurance taskforce and
security agencies in the lead up to the election. We’ve also improved our AI so that we can more
effectively detect and block fake accounts, which are often behind this activity.

○ Since 2017, we have removed over 150 networks around the world including ahead of
major democratic elections. We’re working to find and remove any networks of
Coordinated Inauthentic Behaviour. We’ll also share publicly what we find.
● Protecting candidates and leaders running in the Australian election. In December 2021, we
extended our Facebook Protect security program to Australia. The program has been rolled out
to those who might be at a higher risk of being targeted online, such as candidates and public
officials, encouraging them to adopt stronger account security protections. We will also be
running a Facebook security prompt to candidates and leaders to remind them to turn on two
factor authentication. We are working with the Australian Electoral Commission and political
parties to run training sessions for all candidates on our policies and tools and how to keep safe
in the lead up to the election.

Encouraging transparency around political, election and social issues ads

● Mandatory transparency for political ads. Since the 2019 Australian Federal Election, we’ve
made a series of changes for advertisers in Australia that want to run electoral, political and
social issue ads. Advertisers are now required to go through an authorisation process using
government-issued photo ID, and place a “Paid for by” disclaimers on their ads. This includes any
person creating, modifying, publishing or pausing ads that reference political figures, political
parties or elections. It also includes social issue ads that seek to influence public opinion through
discussion, debate or advocacy for or against important topics, such as civil and social rights,
crime, environmental politics, education or immigration. We launched these requirements for
social issue ads last year, before the first possible election date, to ensure it was in place for the
Australian federal election. Any political, electoral or social issue ads on Facebook and Instagram
that do not have the correct authorisation or disclaimers will be removed from the platform and
archived in a public Ad Library for seven years.

● Allowing Australians to control their experience. While political and social issue ads play an
important role in every election, people have told us they want the option to see fewer of them
in their Facebook and Instagram feeds. Last year, we announced a new feature that gives people
more control by giving them the  choice to see fewer social issues, electoral, and political ads.

Encouraging civic engagement and empowering voters

We want to do more than just prevent abuse on our platforms during elections. We also want to
empower people to participate, so for this year’s Australian elections, we’re supporting civic engagement
in a number of ways.

● Developing products on the platform to encourage people to vote. Closer to election day we
will begin running notifications at the top of Facebook’s Feed for people over 18, reminding
them to vote, while also connecting them with reliable information about the voting process. We
will also be launching Instagram Stories elections stickers to celebrate and encourage voter
engagement.

Election Day Reminder (example only)

● Informing people about the latest election communications from political parties, journalists
and the Australian Election Commission. We will release a public, Live Display on Crowdtangle
dedicated to the Australian Election. The Live Display will provide real-time coverage of the most
recent communications about the election on Facebook and Instagram.

As we get closer to the Australian election, we’ll stay vigilant to emerging threats and take additional
steps if necessary to prevent abuse on our platform while also empowering people in Australia to use
their voice by voting.

                    <p>This document is a Meta Newsroom Post from March 15, 2022, authored by Josh Machin, Head of Public Policy for Meta Australia, detailing Meta's comprehensive strategy to prepare for the 2022 Australian Federal Election. The strategy focuses on four key areas:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Combating Abuse, Misinformation, and Election Interference:</strong> Meta announced the expansion of its third-party fact-checking program in Australia to include RMIT FactLab, alongside Agence France Presse and Australian Associated Press. It committed to providing grants to fact-checkers, reducing the distribution of false content, and running media literacy campaigns like "Check the Facts" (with AAP, translated into multiple languages) and "Don't be a Misinfluencer" (with First Draft).</li>
<li><strong>Security and Election Interference:</strong> Meta highlighted its global teams dedicated to identifying and combating coordinated inauthentic behavior and protecting high-risk accounts through programs like Facebook Protect. Crucially, the document states Meta is "coordinating with the Government's election integrity assurance taskforce and security agencies" and "working with the Australian Electoral Commission and political parties to run training sessions for all candidates."</li>
<li><strong>Encouraging Transparency Around Political, Election, and Social Issues Ads:</strong> Meta detailed mandatory authorization processes for advertisers running political ads, requiring "Paid for by" disclaimers, and archiving all such ads in a public Ad Library for seven years. It also noted a feature allowing users to see fewer political ads.</li>
<li><strong>Encouraging Civic Engagement and Empowering Voters:</strong> Meta planned to use on-platform notifications to remind users to vote and provide reliable information about the voting process.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Relevance to FOI Request LEX3037:</strong></p>
<p>This document is highly relevant to FOI request LEX3037, as it directly corroborates and provides specific detail on the proactive engagement between the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) and major tech companies, including Meta, regarding the 2022 federal election. While not a direct piece of correspondence, it is a public statement by Meta explicitly confirming its "coordinating with the Government's election integrity assurance taskforce" and its direct work "with the Australian Electoral Commission" to provide training and safeguard election integrity. This demonstrates Meta's commitment to, and the nature of its collaboration with, the AEC and its Electoral Integrity Assurance Taskforce to identify, monitor, and address electoral misinformation, disinformation, and non-compliant content as described in the FOI request overview.</p>

                    <p>This document contains limited legible content, primarily comprising a direct message exchange on May 6, 2022, between the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) and Twitter. The AEC flagged a specific Twitter account and tweet, noting it had also been referred to the Australian Federal Police (AFP) due to its "blatant" nature, and requested Twitter to retain records of the account. Twitter acknowledged the request and directed the AEC to its official legal requests submission portal for preservation inquiries.</p>
<p><strong>Relevance to FOI Request LEX3037:</strong><br />
This communication directly evidences the AEC's proactive engagement with major tech companies, as detailed in the FOI request overview. It demonstrates the AEC's use of direct communication channels with platforms like Twitter to identify and address content of concern (implied by the "blatant" nature and AFP referral) in the context of the 2022 federal election, thereby supporting the AEC's aim to safeguard election integrity.</p>

                    <p>This document comprises four email confirmations from TikTok's Trust &amp; Safety team to the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) dating from March to May 2022. Each email acknowledges a referral from the AEC and confirms the removal of content or an account for violating TikTok's community guidelines. The issues addressed include AEC staff being recorded without consent, an AEC impersonation account, electoral misinformation, and other unspecified content referrals.</p>
<p>This document is highly relevant to the FOI request (LEX3037) as it provides concrete examples of the "direct communication channels and content referrals" between the AEC and major tech companies, specifically TikTok, during the 2022 federal election period. It demonstrates the AEC's "proactive engagement" through its Electoral Integrity Assurance Taskforce in "identifying, monitoring, and addressing electoral misinformation, disinformation, and non-compliant content" on the platform, thereby illustrating the collaborative efforts to safeguard election integrity described in the request overview.</p>

The request specifically sought communications from 28 January 2022 onwards about compliance with the *Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918* or related to the election.\n\nThe schedule lists over 100 individual documents, predominantly emails, but also including letters, meeting agendas, and an \"Electoral Communications escalations scenarios\" guide dated 29 October 2021. The correspondence spans from June 2021 (for some foundational communications) primarily through to June 2022, capturing the lead-up to and immediate aftermath of the 2022 election.\n\nKey themes and types of interactions revealed in the document descriptions include:\n*   **Proactive Engagement:** Regular meetings and engagements, often involving the AEC's Electoral Integrity Assurance Taskforce (EIAT), as evidenced by numerous \"Agenda\" and \"Electoral Integrity Taskforce engagement\" entries.\n*   **Content Referrals and Management:** Extensive email exchanges detailing content referrals to platforms (Google, TikTok, Twitter, Meta) for issues such as \"electoral misinformation,\" \"electoral disinformation,\" \"content removal,\" \"AEC Impersonation Referral,\" \"Polling Place Video,\" \"privacy issues,\" and \"abuse.\"\n*   **Compliance and Integrity:** Discussions around \"online authorisations,\" \"disclosure entities,\" and general \"election integrity briefing\" sessions.\n*   **Escalation Processes:** The repeated inclusion of the \"Electoral Communications escalations scenarios\" guide underscores the structured approach to managing potential issues.\n\n### Relevance to the FOI Request Overview\n\nThis document directly fulfills and elaborates on the FOI request overview. It provides the granular detail of the \"correspondence from early 2022 between the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) and major tech companies\" (Meta, Twitter, Google, Microsoft, and TikTok). It explicitly lists the \"Electoral Communications Escalation Scenarios\" guide and numerous instances of \"extensive communication.\"\n\nFurthermore, the schedule confirms and exemplifies the AEC's \"proactive engagement\u2014primarily through its Electoral Integrity Assurance Taskforce\u2014with these platforms.\" The recurring descriptions of \"content referrals,\" \"electoral misinformation,\" and \"election integrity\" discussions directly illustrate the \"collaboration focused on identifying, monitoring, and addressing electoral misinformation, disinformation, and non-compliant content through direct communication channels and content referrals, thereby safeguarding election integrity.\" The document serves as the core evidence demonstrating the scope and nature of this critical interaction.", "model": "gemini-2.5-flash", "generated_at": "2025-06-23T23:29:28.203938", "source_hash": "b5f4c5e00a5f4ce6315b004af7f97e8ce53622d437bd54b1863f0d66cf833561", "raw_response_path": "data/llm_responses/LEX3037__per_file__balanced__lex3037-schedule.pdf__20250623T232928.json", "output_tokens": 579, "prompt_tokens": 4754, "total_tokens": 6459, "summary_length": 2967}, "left_leaning": {"needs_summary": true, "source_hash": "b5f4c5e00a5f4ce6315b004af7f97e8ce53622d437bd54b1863f0d66cf833561"}, "right_leaning": {"needs_summary": true, "source_hash": "b5f4c5e00a5f4ce6315b004af7f97e8ce53622d437bd54b1863f0d66cf833561"}, "government_skeptic": {"needs_summary": true, "source_hash": "b5f4c5e00a5f4ce6315b004af7f97e8ce53622d437bd54b1863f0d66cf833561"}, "government_apologist": {"needs_summary": true, "source_hash": "b5f4c5e00a5f4ce6315b004af7f97e8ce53622d437bd54b1863f0d66cf833561"}, "highly_critical": {"needs_summary": true, "source_hash": "b5f4c5e00a5f4ce6315b004af7f97e8ce53622d437bd54b1863f0d66cf833561"}}, "original_url": "https://www.aec.gov.au/information-access/foi/2022/files/lex3037-schedule.pdf", "link_text": "FOI Request LEX3037, Schedule of Released Documents [PDF 351KB]", "server_filename": "lex3037-schedule.pdf", "extracted_text": "\n\n--- Page 1 ---\n\nRequest for: \n\nFOI REQUEST NO.

The scenarios cover a range of electoral integrity concerns, including:\n\n*   **Unauthorised Paid Electoral Advertising (Scenario 1):** Electoral ads lacking proper authorisation, as required by Section 321D of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918.\n*   **Misleading Voter Information (Scenario 2):** Communications likely to mislead electors on how to cast a vote (Section 329, Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918), such as incorrect advice on candidate withdrawal or formal voting.\n*   **Impersonation of Commonwealth Officials/Entities (Scenario 3):** False representation as a Commonwealth body or official (Section 150.1, Criminal Code Act 1995).\n*   **Foreign Influence and Interference (Scenarios 4 & 5):** Communications by or on behalf of foreign persons/entities (Foreign Influence Transparency Scheme Act 2018) and more broadly, foreign interference activity as defined by the Criminal Code Act 1995 (Division 92, Part 5.2), including covert attempts to influence voting.\n*   **Threats of Terrorist Action (Scenario 6):** Electoral communications threatening violence against polling booths or voters.\n*   **Anonymous Communications (Scenario 7):** Unauthorised communications from disclosure entities.\n*   **Defamation and Disrepute (Scenarios 8 & 9):** Communications defaming candidates or bringing Commonwealth agencies into disrepute, affecting public perception of election integrity.\n*   **Hate Speech (Scenario 10):** Vilification based on protected characteristics, with potential relevance to the Online Safety Act 2021.\n*   **Breaches of Platform Policy (Scenario 11):** Electoral communications that may not breach Commonwealth law but violate platform terms (e.g., spam, false news).\n\nThe document serves as a structured guide for identifying and classifying various forms of potentially harmful or illegal online electoral content.\n\n## Relevance to FOI Request LEX3037\n\nThis document is central to FOI request LEX3037, which concerns correspondence between the AEC and major tech companies regarding compliance with electoral law and the 2022 federal election. The FOI request explicitly mentions the release of an \"Electoral Communications Escalation Scenarios\" guide prepared by the AEC's Electoral Integrity Assurance Taskforce (EIAT).\n\nThis document *is* that guide. Its relevance is critical as it outlines the specific types of content and legal/policy considerations that formed the basis for the AEC's \"proactive engagement\" with tech platforms. It details the criteria the EIAT used to \"identify, monitor, and address electoral misinformation, disinformation, and non-compliant content\" through \"direct communication channels and content referrals.\" The scenarios within the document directly informed the AEC's efforts to safeguard election integrity by providing a framework for identifying problematic communications and the grounds for seeking their removal or intervention by tech companies leading up to the 2022 federal election.", "model": "gemini-2.5-flash", "generated_at": "2025-06-23T23:29:37.679905", "source_hash":

The core of the communication revolves around establishing and optimizing direct communication channels for addressing electoral integrity concerns ahead of the 2022 federal election. Key aspects include:\n\n*   **Dedicated Reporting Channels:** TikTok initiated contact to confirm and update the AEC's \"whitelisted\" email addresses for their \"dedicated reporting channels,\" indicating a system designed for expedited handling of government referrals.\n*   **Categorization of Referrals:** The AEC clarified that referrals originating from its `authorisationsection@aec.gov.au` would pertain to \"legal\" matters, while those from `socialmedia@aec.gov.au` would more likely concern content violating TikTok's \"Terms of Use,\" demonstrating a structured approach to content moderation.\n*   **Pre-Election Coordination Meeting:** Both parties agreed to hold a preparatory meeting on April 5, 2022, to ensure readiness and alignment. The proposed agenda for this meeting included updates on TikTok's election preparedness work (e.g., Election Guide, PSAs) and the AEC providing insights on potential threats or risks to the election.\n*   **Proactive Engagement:** The correspondence illustrates a proactive, collaborative effort to refine operational mechanisms for identifying, monitoring, and addressing potential electoral integrity issues.\n\n### Relevance to FOI Request LEX3037\nThis document is highly relevant to FOI request LEX3037, as it provides direct evidence of the AEC's proactive engagement with major tech companies, specifically TikTok, regarding compliance with electoral law and safeguarding the integrity of the 2022 federal election.

We\u2019ve been involved in more than 200 elections around the world since 2017, and we\u2019ve\nlearned key lessons from each one about where to focus our teams, technologies, and investments so\nthey will have the greatest impact. Here are some of the ways that we\u2019re already promoting safety and\nintegrity across our platforms ahead of this year\u2019s Australian Election.\n\nCombating Abuse, Misinformation, and Election Interference Using a Comprehensive Approach\n\nWe\u2019ve made significant investments in safety and security, including approximately $5 billion/ $AU7\nbillion in 2021 alone and now have more than 40,000 people around the world working on safety and\nsecurity. These investments have allowed us to build our ability to reduce the likelihood of abuses -\nincluding election interference, misinformation and online harms - from happening in the first place,\nrather than just addressing them when they occur. For this year\u2019s Australian election, this work will\ninclude:\n\n\u25cf Announcing a new Australian Fact-Checker. We know the importance of ensuring Australians\nhave access to reliable information about the election in Australia. Therefore, we are pleased to\nannounce the expansion of our third party fact checking program in Australia today. From March\n21, RMIT FactLab will join Meta\u2019s global independent fact checking program in reviewing and\nrating the accuracy of content in the lead up to the 2022 Australian Election, alongside Agence\nFrance Presse and the Australian Associated Press. We'll also be providing one-off grants to all\nour fact-checkers to increase their capacity in the lead up to the election. Our fact checkers work\nto reduce the spread of misinformation across Meta\u2019s services. When they rate something as\n\nReleased under the FOI ActReleased under the FOI Act\n\n\n--- Page 2 ---\n\nfalse, we significantly reduce its distribution so fewer people see it. We also notify people who\ntry to share something rated as false and add a warning label with a link to a debunking article.\n\u25cf Russell Skelton, Director of RMIT FactLab said, \u201cWe see this as a really important public service.\nIf we can play a role in preventing the dissemination of misinformation on social media that has\nthe potential to mislead or harm, then we see that as providing a really critical service.\u201d\n\n\u25cf We are also working with expert organisations such as First Draft to increase monitoring for\nmisinformation in the lead-up to the election and publish related analyses and reporting on their\nwebsite. First Draft will also be providing pre-election training for Australian journalists on how\nto identify and prevent amplifying mis and dis information.\n\n\u25cf Empowering People to Identify False News. Since we know it\u2019s not enough to just limit or\n\nremove harmful or misleading electoral misinformation that people see, we\u2019re giving people\nmore context about a post so they can make an informed decision on what to read, trust and\nshare. We have invested in dedicated Australian initiatives including:\n\n\u25cb Working with the Australian Associated Press to launch an education and awareness\ncampaign comprising a series of short videos modelling how people can recognise and\navoid misinformation by taking simple steps to 'Check the Facts'. The campaign will run\nagain this April and will include, for the first time, content translated in three other\nlanguages - Vietnamese, Simplified Chinese and Arabic to extend the benefits of the\ncampaign even further.\n\n\u25cb Partnering with First Draft to develop the \u201cDon\u2019t be a Misinfluencer\u201d campaign on\n\nFacebook and Instagram to help creators and influencers to share tips for spotting false\nnews.\n\nSecurity and election interference\n\n\u25cf Combatting Influence Operations. We have specialised global teams to identify and take action\nagainst threats to the election, including signs of coordinated inauthentic behaviour across our\napps. We are also coordinating with the Government's election integrity assurance taskforce and\nsecurity agencies in the lead up to the election. We\u2019ve also improved our AI so that we can more\neffectively detect and block fake accounts, which are often behind this activity.\n\n\u25cb Since 2017, we have removed over 150 networks around the world including ahead of\nmajor democratic elections. We\u2019re working to find and remove any networks of\nCoordinated Inauthentic Behaviour. We\u2019ll also share publicly what we find.\n\u25cf Protecting candidates and leaders running in the Australian election. In December 2021, we\nextended our Facebook Protect security program to Australia. The program has been rolled out\nto those who might be at a higher risk of being targeted online, such as candidates and public\nofficials, encouraging them to adopt stronger account security protections. We will also be\nrunning a Facebook security prompt to candidates and leaders to remind them to turn on two\nfactor authentication. We are working with the Australian Electoral Commission and political\nparties to run training sessions for all candidates on our policies and tools and how to keep safe\nin the lead up to the election.\n\nReleased under the FOI ActReleased under the FOI Act\n\n\n--- Page 3 ---\n\nEncouraging transparency around political, election and social issues ads\n\n\u25cf Mandatory transparency for political ads. Since the 2019 Australian Federal Election, we\u2019ve\nmade a series of changes for advertisers in Australia that want to run electoral, political and\nsocial issue ads. Advertisers are now required to go through an authorisation process using\ngovernment-issued photo ID, and place a \u201cPaid for by\u201d disclaimers on their ads. This includes any\nperson creating, modifying, publishing or pausing ads that reference political figures, political\nparties or elections. It also includes social issue ads that seek to influence public opinion through\ndiscussion, debate or advocacy for or against important topics, such as civil and social rights,\ncrime, environmental politics, education or immigration. We launched these requirements for\nsocial issue ads last year, before the first possible election date, to ensure it was in place for the\nAustralian federal election. Any political, electoral or social issue ads on Facebook and Instagram\nthat do not have the correct authorisation or disclaimers will be removed from the platform and\narchived in a public Ad Library for seven years.\n\n\u25cf Allowing Australians to control their experience. While political and social issue ads play an\nimportant role in every election, people have told us they want the option to see fewer of them\nin their Facebook and Instagram feeds. Last year, we announced a new feature that gives people\nmore control by giving them the  choice to see fewer social issues, electoral, and political ads.\n\nEncouraging civic engagement and empowering voters\n\nWe want to do more than just prevent abuse on our platforms during elections. We also want to\nempower people to participate, so for this year\u2019s Australian elections, we\u2019re supporting civic engagement\nin a number of ways.\n\n\u25cf Developing products on the platform to encourage people to vote. Closer to election day we\nwill begin running notifications at the top of Facebook\u2019s Feed for people over 18, reminding\nthem to vote, while also connecting them with reliable information about the voting process. We\nwill also be launching Instagram Stories elections stickers to celebrate and encourage voter\nengagement.\n\nReleased under the FOI ActReleased under the FOI Act\n\n\n--- Page 4 ---\n\nElection Day Reminder (example only)\n\n\u25cf Informing people about the latest election communications from political parties, journalists\nand the Australian Election Commission. We will release a public, Live Display on Crowdtangle\ndedicated to the Australian Election. The Live Display will provide real-time coverage of the most\nrecent communications about the election on Facebook and Instagram.\n\nAs we get closer to the Australian election, we\u2019ll stay vigilant to emerging threats and take additional\nsteps if necessary to prevent abuse on our platform while also empowering people in Australia to use\ntheir voice by voting.\n\n++++\n\nAbout RMIT\n\nReleased under the FOI ActReleased under the FOI Act\n\n\n--- Page 5 ---\n\nRMIT FactLab is a research hub at RMIT University dedicated to debunking misinformation online and\ndeveloping critical awareness about its origins and spread.

These companies include US technology firms such as Meta (Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp), Twitter, Google, Telegram, and LinkedIn, as well as Chinese technology company ByteDance (TikTok). The request specifically covered correspondence created between 28/1/2022 to the date of the request.\n\n### Documents from the FOI Request\n\nThe released documents consist primarily of:\n\n*   **Schedules of Released Documents:** Detailed lists of individual documents (emails, letters, agendas, reports) with dates and descriptions.\n*   **Electoral Communications Escalation Scenarios:** A document dated 29 October 2021 (with an updated version by Google on 7 April 2022) outlining 11 scenarios of electoral communications that could infringe Commonwealth law or platform policy.\n*   **Emails and Letters:** Extensive correspondence between the AEC and:\n    *   **Microsoft:** Emails and letters related to \"Electoral Integrity Assurance Taskforce\" meetings and content referrals.\n    *   **Google (including YouTube):** Numerous emails regarding content referrals, election integrity briefings, and \"Your Request to Google\" messages for content review and removal.\n    *   **TikTok:** Emails concerning content referrals, escalation processes, and updates regarding election content.\n    *   **Twitter:** A large volume of emails related to content referrals concerning election integrity and civic-related content.\n    *   **Meta (Facebook/Instagram):** Emails regarding content requests, post-election wrap-ups, and a detailed document outlining Meta's preparations for the 2022 Australian Election.\n*   **Meeting Agendas:** Agendas for meetings between the AEC's Electoral Integrity Assurance Taskforce (EIAT) and representatives from Microsoft, Google, TikTok, Twitter, and Meta.\n*   **Reports/Briefings:** An undated document titled \"How Meta is Preparing for the 2022 Australian Election.\"\n\nWhile Telegram and LinkedIn were mentioned in the FOI request, no specific documents pertaining to these companies were listed in the released schedule.\n\n### Main Content from the FOI Request Documents\n\nThe documents reveal the AEC's proactive engagement with major tech companies to safeguard the integrity of the 2022 Australian federal election, primarily focusing on combating misinformation, disinformation, and non-compliant electoral communications.\n\n**Key Themes and Content:**\n\n1.  **Electoral Communications Escalation Scenarios:** This foundational document served as a guide for identifying and escalating problematic content. It details scenarios ranging from:\n    *   Unauthorised paid electoral advertisements (Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918, s 321D).\n    *   Misleading voters on how to cast their votes (s 329).\n    *   Impersonation of Commonwealth officials or entities.\n    *   Communications by foreign entities.\n    *   Foreign interference and threats of terrorist action.\n    *   Anonymous electoral communications.\n    *   Defamatory content or content bringing a Commonwealth agency into disrepute.\n    *   Hate speech.\n    *   Other communications that breach platform policies (e.g., spam, false news).\n\n2.  **Collaboration and Communication Channels:** The correspondence highlights the establishment and use of direct communication channels between the AEC's Electoral Integrity Assurance Taskforce (EIAT), Authorisation Section, and Social Media teams with the tech companies. This includes dedicated email addresses for content referrals and regular meetings to discuss election preparedness, integrity measures, and emerging threats.\n\n3.  **Content Referrals and Moderation:** A significant portion of the correspondence involves the AEC referring specific content for review and potential removal by the platforms. Examples of content referred include:\n    *   **Google (YouTube):** Videos containing unauthorised electoral matter (breaching s 321D CEA), privacy violations (e.g., recording without consent under Queensland law), and electoral disinformation (e.g., claims of election fraud). Google/YouTube's responses show content being blocked or removed for violating community guidelines, or in some cases, not meeting their legal policies for removal.\n    *   **TikTok:** Posts misleading about voter enrolment deadlines, videos making false claims about election fraud and lack of authorisation, accounts impersonating the AEC, and videos filmed inside polling places without permission or recording AEC staff without consent. TikTok's responses consistently indicate content or accounts were reviewed and removed for violating their community guidelines.\n    *   **Twitter:** Numerous instances of the AEC flagging tweets related to \"election integrity and/or civic-related content\" and \"electoral misinformation.\" The specific actions taken by Twitter on these flagged items are often noted as \"we have an answer about...\" or involve requests for more information.\n    *   **Meta:** Referrals for Facebook posts regarding electorates and other content requests. The nature of these specific content breaches is less detailed in the provided schedule descriptions, but Meta confirms receipt of these requests.\n\n4.  **Platform-Specific Election Integrity Initiatives:** Documents also detail the tech companies' own efforts to ensure election integrity:\n    *   **Meta:** Expanded third-party fact-checking (e.g., RMIT FactLab joining AFP, AAP), public awareness campaigns (e.g., \"Check the Facts\" in multiple languages), efforts to combat coordinated inauthentic behaviour, security programs (Facebook Protect for candidates), mandatory transparency for political ads (\"Paid for by\" disclaimers, Ad Library), and civic engagement features (voter reminders, Instagram stickers).\n    *   **Google:** Election integrity briefings, and guidance on how to flag issues on their platforms (Search, Ads, YouTube).\n\nIn summary, the documents illustrate a collaborative effort between the AEC and major social media platforms to identify, monitor, and address electoral misinformation, non-compliance with Australian electoral law, and other integrity threats during the 2022 federal election, primarily through established communication channels and content moderation processes.", "model": "gemini-2.5-flash", "generated_at": "2025-06-22T14:08:39.655121", "source_hash": "c4b0aacd4b6c488b98a60cd6fdc166b61dc3dcac050686294ba1e71e3943af1a", "raw_response_path": "data/llm_responses/LEX3037__overall__balanced__20250622T140839.json", "output_tokens": 1303, "prompt_tokens": 25550, "total_tokens": 28989, "summary_length": 6529}, "short_index": {"text": "An FOI request (LEX3037) revealed correspondence from early 2022 between the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) and major tech companies, including Meta, Twitter, Google, Microsoft, and TikTok, regarding compliance with electoral law and the 2022 federal election.

This interaction centers on identifying and responding to various forms of problematic online content, ranging from electoral misinformation to potential foreign interference.\n\n**Corporate Influence & Wealth Distribution:**\nThe documents reveal a significant reliance by the AEC on large, for-profit global technology companies to maintain electoral integrity online. The \"Electoral Integrity Assurance Taskforce\" and its consistent engagement with these tech giants highlight a model where essential democratic functions \u2013 policing disinformation, managing communication, and enforcing electoral law online \u2013 are largely outsourced to private entities. This aligns with a progressive critique regarding the undue influence of powerful corporations over public infrastructure and democratic processes. While these companies commit resources (e.g., Meta's stated $5-7 billion investment in safety/security), the fundamental power asymmetry is clear: public institutions are dependent on the willingness and operational decisions of private corporations, whose primary obligation is to shareholders. This central role of tech companies in mediating national discourse underscores concerns about wealth concentration and the privatization of public goods, where profits are privatized but societal risks, like disinformation, are broadly socialized.\n\n**Social Justice:**\nFrom a social justice perspective, the AEC's efforts, supported by these platforms, to combat misinformation and unauthorized electoral communications are broadly aligned with ensuring a fair and informed democratic process, a cornerstone of social justice. The detection and removal of content designed to mislead voters on how to cast votes (Scenario 2), impersonate officials (Scenario 3), or contain hate speech (Scenario 10) directly contribute to a more equitable and safe electoral environment. Meta's initiative to translate its \"Check the Facts\" media literacy campaign into Vietnamese, Simplified Chinese, and Arabic is a notable positive step, promoting linguistic diversity and ensuring broader access to accurate information for non-English speaking communities. However, the reactive nature of many content moderation efforts, relying on reports and post-publication removal, may be insufficient to proactively protect marginalized groups from targeted disinformation campaigns.\n\n**Civil Liberties:**\nThe documents highlight a delicate balance between safeguarding electoral integrity and upholding civil liberties, particularly freedom of expression. The AEC's focus on transparency in political advertising (requiring authorization, combating anonymous communications) generally aligns with progressive values by promoting accountability and informed voter choice. However, scenarios like \"electoral communication\u2026brings a Commonwealth agency into disrepute\" (Scenario 9) raise concerns. From a left-leaning perspective, such a broad category could potentially be used to stifle legitimate criticism or dissent against government bodies, blurring the line between protecting democratic institutions and suppressing free speech. Furthermore, the power of tech platforms to remove content based on their internal \"Platform policy\" even when no Commonwealth law is breached (Scenario 11) indicates a significant, non-democratically accountable power to regulate public discourse, which could inadvertently lead to censorship or limit diverse viewpoints. Conversely, instances where Google declined removal requests because content didn't breach *legal policies* (though it might violate platform terms) suggest a degree of adherence to legal frameworks over blanket censorship.\n\n**Environmental Impact:**\nDirect mentions of environmental impact are absent from these documents, as their scope is strictly electoral integrity. However, Meta's \"social issue ads\" policy, which includes \"environmental politics\" as an area requiring transparency, suggests a superficial alignment with environmental transparency efforts by requiring disclosure for related political advertisements. This is not an assessment of environmental impact itself, but rather a regulatory framework around communication on the topic.\n\nIn summary, while the government's actions, through the AEC, align with progressive values in seeking to protect democratic integrity, ensure transparency in political communication, and combat harmful speech, the profound reliance on opaque, for-profit corporate entities to achieve these goals represents a significant deviation.

From a politically right-leaning analytical perspective, this interaction raises significant concerns regarding adherence to conservative principles, particularly individual liberty, limited government, and economic efficiency, while also noting aspects related to national security.\n\n**Individual Liberty (Freedom of Speech):** The documents demonstrate a proactive approach by the AEC to monitor and influence content on private digital platforms. The \"Electoral Communications escalations scenarios\" document outlines various categories for intervention, including \"electoral communication that misleads voters\" (Scenario 2), \"impersonates a Commonwealth official\" (Scenario 3), or \"brings a Commonwealth agency into disrepute\" (Scenario 9). Most concerning is Scenario 11, which permits escalation for \"any other electoral communication that may not breach a Commonwealth law, but which may breach Platform policy.\" This last point signifies a deviation from conservative principles of free speech, suggesting a government-backed effort to manage the information environment by leveraging private companies' terms of service, effectively creating a form of censorship by proxy. Repeated emails show the AEC flagging content for removal, often successfully, for reasons ranging from \"unauthorised\" electoral matter to \"electoral misinformation,\" and even for \"recording AEC staff without consent.\" While combating genuine fraud or illegal impersonation aligns with public order, the broad scope of \"misinformation\" and \"bringing agency into disrepute\" opens the door to suppressing legitimate, albeit critical or unpopular, political expression and dissenting views. The focus on \"fact-checking\" that leads to \"significantly reduc[ed] distribution\" of content, as mentioned in Meta's preparatory document, further points to a managed discourse rather than a truly free exchange of ideas.\n\n**Limited Government:** The establishment and active operation of the \"Electoral Integrity Assurance Taskforce\" (EIAT) and its regular engagement with major tech companies represents a considerable expansion of government influence into the digital public square. This level of intervention goes beyond the traditional role of a limited government, as it involves an administrative body actively monitoring, flagging, and requesting the removal of content from private platforms, even when no explicit Commonwealth law is broken. Such collaboration blurs the lines between governmental authority and private corporate action, potentially deputizing tech companies as de facto enforcers of the government's preferred narrative. This overreach risks creating a precedent where government agencies can pressure private entities to restrict speech that is not illegal but deemed undesirable by the state.\n\n**National Security (Foreign Interference):** The documents do show alignment with conservative principles regarding national security by addressing foreign influence and interference (Scenarios 4 and 5). The concern about \"electoral communication made by or on behalf of foreign person or entity that is registrable under the Foreign Influence Transparency Scheme Act 2018 (FITS Act)\" and other forms of \"foreign interference\" reflects a legitimate interest in protecting national sovereignty. However, the \"policy\" definition of foreign interference, which includes promoting \"divisive political positions designed to fragment the electorate\" (Scenario 5), could be interpreted broadly, potentially sweeping in legitimate domestic political debate that is simply deemed \"divisive\" by government agencies. A conservative perspective would advocate for clear distinctions between genuine foreign espionage/meddling and domestic political discourse, even if robust or contentious.\n\n**Economic Efficiency & Fiscal Responsibility:** While the documents do not provide specific cost figures, the existence of a dedicated \"Electoral Integrity Assurance Taskforce,\" its regular meetings, and the volume of correspondence exchanged with multiple large tech companies imply a significant allocation of taxpayer resources (staff time, administrative overhead). From a fiscal responsibility standpoint, a right-leaning analysis would question whether such extensive government machinery dedicated to digital content policing is the most efficient and fiscally prudent use of public funds, especially when considering the potential impact on individual liberties.\n\nIn summary, while aspects of national security (countering foreign interference) align with conservative concerns, the overwhelming impression from these documents is one of government expansion and overreach into the digital speech domain. The extensive collaboration with tech companies for content moderation, particularly for content that does not violate Australian law but merely platform policy, represents a significant deviation from the core conservative principles of limited government and robust individual liberty, raising concerns about a managed public discourse rather than a truly free and open one.", "model": "gemini-2.5-flash", "generated_at": "2025-06-22T14:09:37.081991", "source_hash": "c4b0aacd4b6c488b98a60cd6fdc166b61dc3dcac050686294ba1e71e3943af1a", "raw_response_path": "data/llm_responses/LEX3037__overall__right_leaning__20250622T140937.json", "output_tokens": 904, "prompt_tokens": 25541, "total_tokens": 28300, "summary_length": 5296}, "short_index": {"text": "These FOI documents, from a right-leaning perspective, reveal an alarming expansion of government overreach by the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) into digital speech, fundamentally challenging individual liberty and limited government principles.

Far from merely enforcing Australian law, the documents reveal a proactive and arguably overreaching strategy by a government body to influence and control online discourse, often relying on the subjective \"terms of service\" of private corporations rather than the Commonwealth Electoral Act itself.\n\nKey observations from a skeptical perspective:\n\n*   **Delegated Censorship and Overreach:** The \"Electoral Communications Escalation Scenarios\" document (updated by Google, notably) explicitly includes \"Scenario 11: Any other electoral communication that may not breach a Commonwealth law, but which may breach Platform policy.\" This is a critical admission: the AEC actively requests the removal of content *that is not illegal under Australian law*, instead leveraging the private, opaque, and often inconsistently applied \"community guidelines\" of tech platforms. This allows the government to bypass due process and legal scrutiny, effectively outsourcing censorship to unaccountable private entities.\n*   **Corporate Influence on Government Policy:** The fact that the \"Electoral Communications Escalation Scenarios\" document was \"Updated by Google on 7 April 2022\" is highly problematic. It suggests that a foreign private corporation is directly influencing or co-authoring the operational guidelines for an Australian government body concerning electoral communications. This blurs the lines of sovereignty and raises serious questions about undue corporate influence on public administration and democratic processes.\n*   **Lack of Transparency and Accountability:** The vast majority of the \"released documents\" are merely a schedule of correspondence, providing little to no insight into the actual content of the flagged material or the detailed justification for its referral. The numerous generic \"Your Request has been received\" and \"Content has been removed\" emails from tech companies offer minimal transparency, making it impossible for the public to scrutinize what content was targeted, why, or whether removals were justified. This opaque process undermines public trust in both government and tech platforms.\n*   **Ambiguous Justifications for Removal:** While some referrals relate to clear legal violations (e.g., impersonation of AEC officials), many are vaguely defined, such as \"electoral misinformation\" or \"disinformation.\" For instance, a TikTok video accusing the AEC of \"rigging the election\" was removed. While such claims might be false, their removal by government-prompted corporate action raises concerns about suppressing critical, albeit erroneous, public discourse rather than engaging with it transparently. The removal of a video \"filmed inside a polling place without permission, potentially identifies an AEC staff member\" also suggests a move to control public documentation of electoral processes, potentially hindering transparency and public scrutiny.\n*   **Resource Allocation and Inefficiency:** The sheer volume of individual email referrals between the AEC and various platforms, often for minor or recurring issues (e.g., lack of proper authorisation on content), indicates a significant allocation of government resources to content policing. This manual, reactive approach raises questions about the efficient use of taxpayer money and whether such extensive surveillance and intervention in online speech is a primary or appropriate function for an electoral commission.\n\nIn essence, these documents reveal an electoral body deeply entangled with private tech companies, not merely to enforce laws, but to actively manage and suppress online speech based on the platforms' own, often arbitrary, rules.

This strategic planning enabled the government to anticipate challenges and implement effective response mechanisms.\n\nThroughout the election period, the AEC engaged in extensive and collaborative correspondence with these tech platforms.

Tech companies responded swiftly, with documents showing successful content removals and blocking of videos that violated electoral laws or platform policies.\n*   **Ensuring Transparency and Authorisation:** The government emphasised the necessity of proper authorisation for electoral communications, as mandated by the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918. This ensured voters were aware of the source of political messaging, promoting accountability.\n*   **Protecting Against Impersonation:** Swift action was taken to address instances of entities impersonating the AEC, with tech platforms promptly removing such deceptive accounts or content, thereby safeguarding public trust in official information sources.\n*   **Upholding Privacy and Safety:** Concerns regarding the unauthorised recording of AEC staff in polling places were immediately addressed, demonstrating the government's commitment to protecting the privacy and safety of those administering the election.\n*   **Proactive Security Measures:** Beyond reactive content moderation, the documents reveal Meta's comprehensive preparations, including expanding fact-checking programs, launching media literacy campaigns, combating influence operations, and offering security programs like \"Facebook Protect\" to candidates. Similarly, Google provided resources like its \"Civics Training Centre\" and political advertising transparency reports, empowering participants and the public.\n\nThe numerous emails detailing content referrals and subsequent removals by the tech companies underscore the effectiveness of these collaborations.

Abdication of Sovereignty and Legislative Failure:**\nThe documents reveal a shocking reliance on the \"community guidelines\" and internal \"legal policies\" of foreign tech giants like Google, Meta, and TikTok, rather than robust Australian law. The AEC's own \"Electoral Communications Escalation Scenarios\" document explicitly admits a critical legal vacuum, noting that some issues \"may not breach a Commonwealth law, but which may breach Platform policy.\" This is a catastrophic confession of legislative negligence, leaving fundamental aspects of Australian electoral integrity to the arbitrary whims of corporate terms of service. In one damning instance, the YouTube Legal Support Team flatly rejected an AEC request to restrict content, stating, \"we didn't find grounds to restrict the URL(s) at issue under our legal policies,\" despite the AEC citing potential breaches of both Queensland privacy law and the Commonwealth Electoral Act. The AEC was then advised to \"try to resolve any issues directly with the creator of the content\" or \"pursue legal action,\" exposing the AEC as utterly toothless in directly enforcing Australian law.\n\n**2. Reactive and Overwhelmed Response to Pervasive Misinformation:**\nThe sheer volume of content referral emails, particularly with Twitter and Meta, indicates an electoral environment plagued by widespread \"misinformation,\" \"disinformation,\" \"impersonation,\" and \"unauthorised communications.\" The AEC functions merely as a reactive reporting service, submitting a relentless stream of \"requests\" and \"referrals\" into corporate black boxes. This reactive approach, where the AEC must wait for platforms to \"review\" or \"complete\" actions, guarantees that harmful, misleading, or illegal content remains visible and influences voters during critical election periods. The constant \"Your Request... has been received\" emails highlight a process of passive submission rather than authoritative demand.\n\n**3. Direct Admission of Vulnerability to Foreign Interference:**\nThe AEC's own \"Electoral Communications Escalation Scenarios\" document contains a staggering admission: \"Detection and attribution [of foreign interference] can be time and resource intensive, while disinformation strategies are cheap and agile.\" This is a public confession of the Australian government's severe incapacity and under-resourcing to effectively combat sophisticated, potentially state-sponsored, attacks on its democratic process. It suggests a known vulnerability that was not adequately addressed.\n\n**4. Foreign Corporations Dictating Terms and Strategy:**\nThe humiliating extent of the AEC's subservience is starkly evident in documents like the \"Electoral Communications Escalation Scenarios\" explicitly stating \"Updated by Google,\" demonstrating that foreign corporations are directly shaping the frameworks intended to protect Australian elections. Furthermore, Meta's \"How Meta is Preparing for the 2022 Australian Election\" is presented as a released document, yet it is merely a corporate public relations piece outlining Meta's unilateral actions and significant internal investments. This underscores Meta's self-appointed role as an independent arbiter of Australian elections, without apparent direct control or directive from the AEC.\n\n**5. Repeated Failures in Content Integrity:**\nThe documents detail a litany of severe electoral malfeasance requiring external intervention:\n*   False claims of widespread election fraud, including \"dead people are enrolled to vote\" and \"identification is not required to enrol to vote,\" being disseminated on platforms like TikTok.\n*   Direct impersonation of the AEC itself on TikTok.\n*   Illicit filming inside polling places and counting centres, including AEC staff without consent, coupled with \"disinformation accusing the AEC of rigging the election.\"\n*   Unauthorised electoral advertising and communications, a direct breach of the Commonwealth Electoral Act, requiring AEC to report to platforms.\nThe sheer frequency and gravity of these incidents reveal a profound breakdown in information integrity during the election, with the AEC relegated to merely flagging issues for companies to address on their own terms.\n\n**6. Critical Omission in FOI Release:**\nDespite the explicit request for \"all correspondence... between the Australian Election Commission and...
