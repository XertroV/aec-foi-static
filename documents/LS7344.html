      <h1>FOI Request LS7344 Summary</h1>
<h2>Main Purpose of the FOI Request</h2>
<p>The Freedom of Information (FOI) Request LS7344 sought "All correspondence about compliance with the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 between the Australian Election Commission and the US technology companies Facebook Inc. and Twitter Inc. since July 2017."</p>
<h2>Documents from the FOI Request</h2>
<p>The released documents specifically pertain to correspondence between the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) and Twitter Inc. (Facebook Inc. correspondence is not included in this release). The schedule lists four key email documents, all exchanged in August 2018:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Document 1 (22/08/2018):</strong> Email from Kara Hinesley (Twitter) to AEC representatives (Evan Ekin-Smyth, Tim Courtney, Andrew Johnson) following up on a meeting.</li>
<li><strong>Document 2 (22/08/2018):</strong> Email from Emily Foat (Twitter Australia) to Kara Hinesley (Twitter) offering a media workshop to the AEC.</li>
<li><strong>Document 3 (23/08/2018):</strong> Email from Evan Ekin-Smyth (AEC) to Emily Foat and Kara Hinesley (Twitter) confirming receipt and indicating further follow-up.</li>
<li><strong>Document 4 (30/08/2018):</strong> Email from Andrew Johnson (AEC Principal Government Lawyer) to Emily Foat and Kara Hinesley (Twitter) proposing detailed scenarios for compliance with the Commonwealth Electoral Act.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Main Content Related to the FOI Request</h2>
<p>The correspondence details the AEC's efforts to establish a clear and efficient process with Twitter for ensuring compliance with the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918, particularly regarding the authorisation of electoral communications on the platform.</p>
<p>Key content includes:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Initial Engagement (August 2018):</strong> The emails confirm an in-person meeting took place between AEC and Twitter representatives (Kara Hinesley, Emily Foat, Evan Ekin-Smyth, Tim Courtney, Andrew Johnson) to discuss handling issues during future campaigns and elections. Twitter offered to conduct a media workshop for the AEC to optimize platform use for campaigns.</li>
<li><strong>Proposed Compliance Scenarios:</strong> Andrew Johnson of the AEC outlined three scenarios and proposed actions for Twitter's assistance in managing non-compliant electoral communications on the platform:<ol>
<li><strong>Paid electoral advertisements without proper authorisation:</strong> The AEC would attempt to contact the responsible party first. If unsuccessful, they would notify Twitter, expecting Twitter to remove/block the ad or ensure its authorisation.</li>
<li><strong>Anonymous communications containing electoral matter:</strong> The AEC would try to ascertain if the responsible party is a "disclosure entity" (requiring authorisation). If this cannot be confirmed, Twitter would be asked to assist. If the party is a disclosure entity and fails to authorise, Twitter would be expected to remove/block the content. Twitter could confirm disclosure entity status without sharing personal information with the AEC.</li>
<li><strong>Electoral advertisements infringing other Electoral Act offences (e.g., misleading/deceptive content):</strong> The AEC would request information from Twitter about the person or entity responsible for the communication.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>Legal Recourse:</strong> The AEC noted that if Twitter is unable to remove or block non-compliant communications or provide requested information, the AEC (or a candidate) may seek an injunction against the responsible party and/or Twitter under Section 383 of the Electoral Act.</li>
<li><strong>Electoral Act Background:</strong> The AEC provided a summary of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918, explaining that Part XXA requires authorisation for electoral communications to inform voters who is responsible for the content, but it does not regulate the truth of the communications. Definitions for "electoral matter" and "disclosure entity" were also included.</li>
</ul>

    <div class="ai-summary-markdown-content">
      <p>The provided FOI documents detail correspondence between the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) and Twitter Inc. in August 2018, specifically concerning compliance with the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 regarding electoral communications. As a politically left-leaning analyst, several issues arise:</p>
<p><strong>Alignment with Progressive Values:</strong><br />
The AEC's stated primary concern, that "voters know who is communicating an electoral matter to them," aligns with the progressive value of <strong>transparency in democratic processes</strong>. Ensuring that political advertising and communications are authorized helps combat clandestine influence and allows citizens to understand the source of information, a foundational element for informed public participation.</p>
<p><strong>Deviation from Progressive Values and Areas of Concern:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Social Justice &amp; Misinformation:</strong> The most significant deviation from progressive values is explicitly stated: "The Electoral Act does not regulate truth in electoral communications." This is a critical failure from a social justice perspective. While the AEC focuses on <em>who</em> is communicating, it allows for the unhindered spread of potentially misleading or deceptive information, provided it is authorized. This directly undermines the integrity of the electoral process and can disproportionately harm vulnerable communities through disinformation campaigns, which are often used to sow division, suppress votes, or spread discriminatory narratives. A progressive approach would advocate for mechanisms to address the <em>accuracy</em> and <em>truthfulness</em> of electoral content, not just its attribution.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Corporate Influence &amp; Wealth Distribution:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The documents reveal a dynamic where a powerful US technology corporation, Twitter, is actively engaged in shaping its regulatory environment. Twitter's representatives proactively offer a "Twitter media workshop to update you on Twitter's media solutions and showcase the best way to utilise the platform from a campaign perspective." This highlights the inherent power imbalance: a private, profit-driven entity offering "solutions" to a government regulator, rather than simply being subject to regulations. This suggests corporations are not just complying but are actively involved in determining the <em>mechanisms</em> of compliance, potentially to their own commercial advantage.</li>
<li>The focus on "paid electoral advertisements" underscores how financial resources can leverage corporate platforms to amplify political messages. While the AEC aims for transparency of authorship, the underlying issue of wealth influencing electoral discourse through paid content on these platforms remains unaddressed by the Act itself.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Civil Liberties (Freedom of Speech vs. Public Interest):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Act's narrow focus on authorization, rather than content accuracy, represents a particular interpretation of freedom of speech that prioritizes the speaker's right to disseminate information without government scrutiny over the public's right to accurate information in a democratic context. From a progressive viewpoint, absolute freedom of speech should not extend to deliberate disinformation that undermines public trust or manipulates democratic outcomes, particularly when propagated by powerful actors or through paid means.</li>
<li>The scenarios also involve Twitter being asked to "remove or block" non-compliant communications and, in more serious cases, to "provide the AEC the requested information" about responsible persons or entities. While this is necessary for enforcement, it vests significant power in a private company (Twitter) to act as a gatekeeper of political speech and to share user data with government, raising questions about accountability, transparency in content moderation decisions, and potential implications for privacy and surveillance if not strictly limited and overseen.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In summary, while the AEC's efforts to ensure transparency in electoral communication authorship align with basic democratic principles, the documents reveal a regulatory framework (and its application) that falls short of progressive ideals by failing to address the fundamental issue of misinformation, allowing powerful corporations to maintain significant influence over the digital public square, and potentially creating an environment where wealth can distort democratic discourse, all while operating under a narrow interpretation of civil liberties that prioritizes attribution over accuracy and the public good.</p>

    <div class="ai-summary-markdown-content">
      <p>These FOI documents reveal a concerning expansion of government regulatory reach into the operations of a private technology company, Twitter, under the guise of electoral compliance. The Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) is seen attempting to offload its enforcement responsibilities onto Twitter, demanding the company implement content removal or blocking for non-compliant electoral communications and threatening legal action if it fails to do so.</p>
<p>From a conservative perspective, this presents several significant deviations from core principles:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Economic Efficiency &amp; Fiscal Responsibility:</strong> The AEC's proposed framework effectively turns Twitter into an unpaid enforcement arm of the government. This imposes significant, uncompensated compliance costs and operational burdens on a private enterprise, diverting resources from innovation and value creation towards government-mandated content policing. It represents a subtle but impactful form of regulatory tax on the private sector, externalizing government expenses rather than transparently funding them through taxpayer dollars. This is fiscally irresponsible for the government, as it avoids direct costs by imposing them on the private sector.</li>
<li><strong>Individual Liberty &amp; Limited Government:</strong> The most striking deviation is the threat to individual liberty and free speech. The AEC demands Twitter 'remove or block' content that lacks specific government-mandated authorization, including anonymous communications. While the stated aim is transparency—allowing voters to know who is behind a message—the mechanism chosen involves government-coerced censorship by a private platform. This is a significant overreach of government power, compelling a private entity to limit the expression of its users based on regulatory labels rather than factual accuracy (as the AEC notes, the Act 'does not regulate truth in electoral communications'). This actively undermines the principle of limited government by expanding state control over information flow and private sector operations, transforming a platform into a de facto regulatory agent.</li>
<li><strong>National Security:</strong> These documents do not directly address national security concerns; their focus is on domestic electoral compliance and transparency rather than foreign interference or cyber threats.</li>

    <div class="ai-summary-markdown-content">
      <p>The released FOI documents, in response to a request for correspondence between the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) and US tech giants Facebook and Twitter regarding compliance with the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918, reveal a concerning degree of collaboration and planned intervention between a government regulator and a foreign private corporation. Notably, while the request encompassed both Facebook and Twitter, only documents pertaining to Twitter were provided, immediately raising questions about the completeness of the disclosure or the extent of government engagement with other major platforms.</p>
<p>The documents primarily detail exchanges from August 2018, illustrating a cooperative relationship where Twitter's representatives meet with the AEC, expressing a desire to "develop detailed and efficient ways to handle any issues that might arise during future campaigns and elections." This language, while seemingly innocuous, can be interpreted as a proactive move towards managing and potentially limiting public discourse on the platform under the guise of "efficiency."</p>
<p>Further blurring the lines between regulation and corporate influence, Twitter offered to conduct a "media workshop" for AEC staff, framed as an update on "Twitter's media solutions" and showcasing "the best way to utilise the platform from a campaign perspective." This suggests the AEC, the body responsible for fair elections, might be receiving guidance or even implicit direction on campaigning from a private entity with its own commercial interests, potentially creating an uneven playing field or subtly endorsing certain campaign methods. This also raises questions about potential waste of public resources if the AEC is relying on such external, potentially biased, "training."</p>
<p>The most significant revelations come from the AEC's proposals for managing electoral communications on Twitter. The AEC outlines scenarios where it would request Twitter to "remove or block" content deemed non-compliant with authorisation requirements, including anonymous communications or paid ads lacking proper disclosure. This indicates a direct outsourcing of content moderation and potential censorship power from an Australian government agency to a foreign private company, bypassing formal Australian judicial processes and creating an unaccountable system for determining what content is permissible.</p>
<p>Even more concerning is the AEC's stated intent to seek "further details on the person or entity responsible" for content that "may breach more serious electoral offences," such as those "likely to mislead or deceive an elector." While the Electoral Act is explicitly stated not to regulate "truth in electoral communications," the AEC's interest in "misleading or deceptive" content suggests a creeping overreach into content regulation beyond simple authorisation. This also raises significant privacy concerns, as Twitter is implicitly expected to share user data with the government, or at the very least, make determinations about users' identities and compliance without full transparency to the public or independent oversight.</p>
<p>Finally, the AEC's explicit warning that it "may get an injunction" against Twitter if the platform "is unable to remove or block a communication... or cannot provide information" serves as a thinly veiled threat. This highlights the coercive power the government is willing to wield over private companies to ensure compliance with its content management demands, demonstrating a pattern of exerting control over digital information flows through external intermediaries rather than direct, transparent government action with clear accountability.</p>
<p>In sum, these documents paint a picture of a government agency actively seeking to control electoral discourse online through a private platform, raising serious questions about transparency, due process, potential overreach into content regulation, and the outsourcing of censorship to a foreign corporation under implicit coercion. The absence of Facebook documents further casts doubt on the completeness of information provided under the FOI.</p>

      <p>These Freedom of Information documents highlight the Australian Electoral Commission's (AEC) proactive and effective approach to safeguarding the integrity of Australia's democratic processes, particularly in the evolving digital landscape. The correspondence reveals the AEC's diligent efforts to ensure compliance with the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918, a vital piece of legislation designed to promote transparency and accountability in electoral communications.</p>
<p>The documents demonstrate strong collaborative engagement between the AEC and major US technology companies, specifically Twitter Inc., to ensure the smooth and fair conduct of elections. The AEC initiated contact and held meetings with Twitter, fostering an environment where both parties could work together to uphold the law. Twitter's positive response, including offers to provide workshops and establish clear communication channels, underscores a shared commitment to effective governance.</p>
<p>A key focus of these interactions was ensuring that all electoral communications on social media platforms adhere to authorisation requirements. This crucial regulation allows voters to know the source of information, promoting an informed and transparent electoral discourse. The AEC proactively provided Twitter with detailed scenarios and clear processes for managing potential issues, such as unauthorised paid advertisements or anonymous communications that may contain electoral matter. This structured approach exemplifies the government's foresight and commitment to addressing challenges effectively before they escalate.</p>
<p>By outlining clear steps for identification, rectification, and, if necessary, removal of non-compliant content, the AEC is ensuring that the digital sphere remains a robust and trustworthy environment for democratic engagement. The potential for injunctions, as outlined in the documents, serves as a necessary and appropriate measure to uphold the law and protect the public interest in fair elections. Overall, these documents showcase the government's dedicated efforts to adapt regulatory frameworks to new technologies, working cooperatively with industry to serve the public by maintaining the highest standards of electoral integrity.</p>

    <div class="ai-summary-markdown-content">
      <p>The provided FOI documents paint a damning picture of the Australian Electoral Commission's (AEC) profound failure to adequately safeguard the integrity of federal elections against the pervasive threat of online manipulation and non-compliance. The evidence points to gross incompetence, reactive instead of proactive measures, and a disturbing deferral of regulatory authority to foreign technology giants.</p>
<p><strong>1. Glaring Omission and Apparent Negligence:</strong><br />
The FOI request explicitly sought "All correspondence about compliance with the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 between the Australian Election Commission and the US technology companies Facebook Inc. and Twitter Inc. since July 2017."<br />
*   <strong>The Damning Reality:</strong> The "Schedule of Relevant Documents" lists a paltry four emails, all exclusively with <em>Twitter</em>, and all confined to a mere nine-day window in August 2018. There is a complete and inexplicable absence of <em>any</em> correspondence with Facebook Inc., a dominant platform with immense electoral influence, spanning over a year and leading up to a federal election. This is either:<br />
    *   <strong>Deliberate Concealment:</strong> A ruthless refusal to fully comply with the FOI request, indicating a conscious decision to hide the extent of AEC's inaction or sensitive exchanges.<br />
    *   <strong>Abject Incompetence:</strong> The AEC failed to maintain proper records of critical communications, or their record-keeping is so disorganised they couldn't locate relevant documents.<br />
    *   <strong>Shocking Dereliction of Duty:</strong> The AEC had <em>no significant engagement whatsoever</em> with Facebook on electoral compliance for over a year leading up to a federal election. This represents an astonishing dereliction of its fundamental duty to ensure a fair and compliant electoral process in the digital age, leaving a massive vector for manipulation wide open.</p>
<p><strong>2. Belated, Reactive, and Toothless Engagement:</strong><br />
The correspondence reveals a desperate, last-minute scramble by the AEC to engage with Twitter less than a year before the May 2019 federal election.<br />
*   <strong>Meeting Agenda - A Sales Pitch?</strong> The initial emails (Docs 1, 2, 3) are alarmingly cordial, with Twitter offering "detailed and efficient ways to handle any issues" and even a "media workshop to update you on Twitter's media solutions and showcase the best way to utilise the platform from a campaign perspective." This suggests the AEC was treated more like a potential client or partner than a robust regulator asserting its authority.<br />
*   <strong>"Scenarios" - An Admission of Weakness:</strong> Document 4, AEC's "scenarios," exposes the AEC's shocking lack of direct enforcement power. Its "plan" is to "notify Twitter" and <em>ask</em> the company to "remove or block" non-compliant content. The AEC is effectively begging a foreign corporation to enforce Australian law, rather than possessing the direct legal or technical means to do so itself. This is a profound regulatory failure, placing the integrity of Australian elections at the mercy of a private company's goodwill and internal policies.<br />
*   <strong>Relinquishing Sovereignty:</strong> In Scenario 2, Twitter is asked to "confirm whether a person or entity is a disclosure entity" to "avoid the need to share personal or commercial information with the AEC." This implies the AEC lacks the independent capability or willingness to identify such entities itself, or is overly deferential to Twitter's privacy concerns, allowing a foreign company to act as a gatekeeper for Australian electoral law. This is a humiliating concession of sovereign authority over election integrity.<br />
*   <strong>The "Injunction" Threat - A Last Resort of the Desperate:</strong> The AEC's ultimate "recourse" is an injunction, explicitly stated as potentially against Twitter itself. This is not a strong enforcement mechanism but a costly, time-consuming legal battle, highlighting the AEC's shocking lack of direct, nimble, and effective tools to manage real-time online threats. It underscores that their "agreed process" is fundamentally non-binding and relies on voluntary compliance, not enforceable regulation.</p>
<p><strong>3. Critical Systemic Flaws in Australian Electoral Law (and AEC's Inability to Address Them):</strong><br />
Document 4 contains a truly damning admission: "The Electoral Act does not regulate truth in electoral communications."<br />
*   <strong>Open Door for Disinformation:</strong> In an era rife with sophisticated disinformation campaigns, this is a catastrophic legislative void. The AEC's focus is narrowly on "authorisation requirements" (who paid/published), largely ignoring the <em>content</em> and <em>veracity</em> of electoral messaging unless it directly "mislead[s] or deceive[s] an elector in relation to the casting of a vote" (a high bar). This legal loophole provides a fertile ground for anonymous, false, or misleading information to spread unchecked, fundamentally undermining the democratic process.<br />
*   <strong>Narrow Focus - Broad Consequences:</strong> The AEC's rigid adherence to a law primarily designed for traditional print media, without robust amendments for the digital age, demonstrates a profound failure of foresight and adaptability. By focusing solely on attribution and not content integrity, the AEC is essentially permitting the electoral landscape to be polluted with unchecked deception, so long as it’s not paid advertising from a disclosure entity, or not misleading about the act of voting itself.</p>
<p>In conclusion, these FOI documents do not show a proactive, powerful, or effective regulator. Instead, they expose an Australian Electoral Commission that was embarrassingly behind the curve, engaging in a polite, toothless dance with a single major platform, while simultaneously admitting its legal framework was fundamentally inadequate to combat the pervasive disinformation threatening the integrity of Australian democracy. The glaring absence of Facebook correspondence seals the narrative of an agency ill-equipped and potentially unwilling to assert the necessary authority in the digital age, leaving the electoral process dangerously vulnerable.</p>

Hi Tim, Evan, and Andrew,

Thanks for the introduction Kara, great meeting you all yesterday,  
As mentioned in our meeting I&#39;m happy to fly to Canberra to facilitate a Twitter media 
workshop to update you on Twitter&#39;s media solutions and showcase the best way to utilise the 
platform from a campaign perspective.  

Please let me know if this would be helpful and we can start looking at some available dates? 

Many Thanks, 
Emily

Subject: AEC follow up - scenarios regarding compliance with the Commonwealth Electoral Act 
[SEC=UNCLASSIFIED] 

Good Morning Emily and Kara 

It was good to meet you in Sydney last week.  At the meeting I said I would provide some 
scenarios on how we can manage electoral communications on Twitter that do not comply 
with the authorisation requirements in the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 (Electoral 
Act).  The closer the electoral communication is to a Federal election the more urgent it will 
be to either obtain prompt compliance with the Electoral Act or to block or remove the 
non-compliant communication.  To this end the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) is 
keen to agree on the process with Twitter for escalating and resolving any such matters.   

I have set out below three scenarios.  The first two scenarios are the most likely occur, the 
third scenario will only arise if the AEC is concerned that a communication may breach more 
serious electoral offences in Part XXI of the Electoral Act.  For each scenario I have outlined 
the actions the AEC will take, when we will contact you and the assistance we will require 
from Twitter.  For completeness I have included a summary of the authorisation 
requirements in the Electoral Act.   

Given the increasing use of social media by political participants, we are interested in your 
views on the processes suggested below for escalating and resolving any Electoral Act 
compliance issues that may arise with electoral communications on social media. 

Kind regards

Authorisation of electoral communications on 
social media scenarios 

1.  Paid electoral advertisement on Twitter without proper authorisation 

Issue:  Paid electoral advertisements require an authorisation to allow voters to know who is 

communicating the advertisement. 

Actions: 

Event 
Unauthorised electoral ad on 
Twitter  

Entity 
AEC 

Inadequate response from 
person or entity responsible 
for the electoral ad 
AEC notifies Twitter of the 
unauthorised electoral ad 

AEC 

Twitter 

Action 
Contact or attempt to contact the person or entity 
responsible for the electoral ad to advise of the legal 
requirements in the Electoral Act and ask them to 
rectify or remove the ad. 
Notify Twitter of an unauthorised electoral ad on 
social media site. 

Remove or block the electoral ad, or contact the 
person or entity responsible for the ad and advise 
them to add an authorisation or have the ad 
removed or blocked. 

2.  Anonymous communication on Twitter containing electoral matter 

Issue:  AEC unable to determine whether an anonymous communication is electoral matter that 

requires an authorisation under the Electoral Act. 

Actions: 

Event 
Anonymous communication 
containing electoral matter on 
Twitter 

Entity 
AEC 

Inadequate response from 
person or entity responsible for 
the anonymous electoral 
communication 
AEC notifies Twitter of the 
electoral communication and the 
need to settle whether the 
responsible person or entity is a 
disclosure entity 
Confirm the person or entity 
responsible for the electoral 
communication is: * 
  not a disclosure entity  

AEC 

Twitter 

Twitter 

Action 
Contact or attempt to contact the person or 
entity responsible for the electoral 
communication to ascertain whether they are a 
disclosure entity and advise of the legal 
requirements for disclosure entities to authorise 
electoral communications. 
Notify Twitter of an anonymous communication 
containing electoral matter and the need to 
ascertain whether the responsible person or 
entity is a disclosure entity. 
Contact the person or entity responsible for the 
electoral communication to advise of the 
authorisation requirements in the Electoral Act.   

  Advise the AEC. No further action. 

LS7344 Released Document No 4Released under the Freedom of Information Act 1982


--- Page 3 ---

  a disclosure entity  

  Advise the AEC. Remove or block the 

communication if the responsible person 
or entity does not take action to add an 
authorisation in compliance with the 
Electoral Act. 

*   If Twitter is able to confirm whether a person or entity is a disclosure entity, this will 
avoid the need to share personal or commercial information with the AEC.  AEC can 
provide advice on the categories of a persons or entities that are disclosure entities for 
the purposes of the Electoral Act.   

3.  Paid electoral advertisement on Twitter that infringes other offences in 

the Electoral Act  

Issue:  In addition to the issues raised above, the AEC may need further details on the person or 
entity responsible for an electoral communication to consider other civil or criminal action 
under the Electoral Act.  For example it is an offence under section 329 of the Electoral Act to 
publish or distribute or cause to be published or distributed any electoral communication that 
is likely to mislead or deceive an elector in relation to the casting of a vote. 

Actions:  In addition to the actions outlined above: 

Event 
Incomplete information on the 
person or entity responsible for 
an electoral communication on 
social media 
Request from the AEC for 
information 

Entity 
AEC 

Action 
Seek information from Twitter about the person 
or entity responsible for the communication. 

Twitter 

Provide the AEC the requested information. 

In any of the above scenarios, if Twitter is unable to remove or block a communication that does not 
comply with the Electoral Act or cannot provide information about the person or entity responsible 
for the communication, then the AEC (or a candidate in an election) may get an injunction under 
section 383 of the Electoral Act against the person or entity responsible for the communication 
and/or Twitter. 

Background 
The Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 (Electoral Act) is concerned that voters know who is 
communicating an electoral matter to them (electoral communication).  The Electoral Act does not 
regulate truth in electoral communications.  Part XXA of the Electoral Act requires electoral 
communications to have an authorisation to inform voters who is responsible for the 
communication. 

For a social media communication to be an electoral communication requiring an authorisation 
under section 321D of the Electoral Act, the communication must: 

 

contain electoral matter, and 

  be at least one of the following: 

o  a paid electoral advertisement, 

LS7344 Released Document No 4Released under the Freedom of Information Act 1982


--- Page 4 ---

o  a matter communicated by, on behalf of, a disclosure entity. 

‘Electoral matter’ is defined in section 4(1) of the Electoral Act as ‘matter which is intended or likely 
to affect voting in an election’. For the purpose of the authorisation requirements in Part XXA of the 
Electoral Act, paragraph 4(9)(b) clarifies that there must be a sufficient connection between the 
subject matters of federal elections:  

(9)   Without limiting the definition of electoral matter in subsection (1), matter is taken to be 

intended or likely to affect voting in an election if: 

(b)    … in Part XXA—it contains an express or implicit reference to: 

(i)    the election; or 

(ii)   a political party, a branch or division of a political party or a candidate or group 

of candidates in the election; or 

(iii)  an issue submitted to, or otherwise before, the electors in connection with the 

election. 

‘Disclosure entity’ is defined in section 321B of the Electoral Act to be a political party, associated 
entity, member of the House of Representatives, Senator, a candidate or group of candidates in a 
federal election or other persons or entities who engage in the electoral process and are required by 
the Electoral Act to provide a return.

(Facebook Inc. correspondence is not included in this release). The schedule lists four key email documents, all exchanged in August 2018:\n\n*   **Document 1 (22/08/2018):** Email from Kara Hinesley (Twitter) to AEC representatives (Evan Ekin-Smyth, Tim Courtney, Andrew Johnson) following up on a meeting.\n*   **Document 2 (22/08/2018):** Email from Emily Foat (Twitter Australia) to Kara Hinesley (Twitter) offering a media workshop to the AEC.\n*   **Document 3 (23/08/2018):** Email from Evan Ekin-Smyth (AEC) to Emily Foat and Kara Hinesley (Twitter) confirming receipt and indicating further follow-up.\n*   **Document 4 (30/08/2018):** Email from Andrew Johnson (AEC Principal Government Lawyer) to Emily Foat and Kara Hinesley (Twitter) proposing detailed scenarios for compliance with the Commonwealth Electoral Act.\n\n## Main Content Related to the FOI Request\nThe correspondence details the AEC's efforts to establish a clear and efficient process with Twitter for ensuring compliance with the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918, particularly regarding the authorisation of electoral communications on the platform.\n\nKey content includes:\n\n*   **Initial Engagement (August 2018):** The emails confirm an in-person meeting took place between AEC and Twitter representatives (Kara Hinesley, Emily Foat, Evan Ekin-Smyth, Tim Courtney, Andrew Johnson) to discuss handling issues during future campaigns and elections. Twitter offered to conduct a media workshop for the AEC to optimize platform use for campaigns.\n*   **Proposed Compliance Scenarios:** Andrew Johnson of the AEC outlined three scenarios and proposed actions for Twitter's assistance in managing non-compliant electoral communications on the platform:\n    1.  **Paid electoral advertisements without proper authorisation:** The AEC would attempt to contact the responsible party first. If unsuccessful, they would notify Twitter, expecting Twitter to remove/block the ad or ensure its authorisation.\n    2.  **Anonymous communications containing electoral matter:** The AEC would try to ascertain if the responsible party is a \"disclosure entity\" (requiring authorisation). If this cannot be confirmed, Twitter would be asked to assist. If the party is a disclosure entity and fails to authorise, Twitter would be expected to remove/block the content. Twitter could confirm disclosure entity status without sharing personal information with the AEC.\n    3.  **Electoral advertisements infringing other Electoral Act offences (e.g., misleading/deceptive content):** The AEC would request information from Twitter about the person or entity responsible for the communication.\n*   **Legal Recourse:** The AEC noted that if Twitter is unable to remove or block non-compliant communications or provide requested information, the AEC (or a candidate) may seek an injunction against the responsible party and/or Twitter under Section 383 of the Electoral Act.\n*   **Electoral Act Background:** The AEC provided a summary of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918, explaining that Part XXA requires authorisation for electoral communications to inform voters who is responsible for the content, but it does not regulate the truth of the communications.

As a politically left-leaning analyst, several issues arise:\n\n**Alignment with Progressive Values:**\nThe AEC's stated primary concern, that \"voters know who is communicating an electoral matter to them,\" aligns with the progressive value of **transparency in democratic processes**. Ensuring that political advertising and communications are authorized helps combat clandestine influence and allows citizens to understand the source of information, a foundational element for informed public participation.\n\n**Deviation from Progressive Values and Areas of Concern:**\n\n1.  **Social Justice & Misinformation:** The most significant deviation from progressive values is explicitly stated: \"The Electoral Act does not regulate truth in electoral communications.\" This is a critical failure from a social justice perspective. While the AEC focuses on *who* is communicating, it allows for the unhindered spread of potentially misleading or deceptive information, provided it is authorized. This directly undermines the integrity of the electoral process and can disproportionately harm vulnerable communities through disinformation campaigns, which are often used to sow division, suppress votes, or spread discriminatory narratives. A progressive approach would advocate for mechanisms to address the *accuracy* and *truthfulness* of electoral content, not just its attribution.\n\n2.  **Corporate Influence & Wealth Distribution:**\n    *   The documents reveal a dynamic where a powerful US technology corporation, Twitter, is actively engaged in shaping its regulatory environment. Twitter's representatives proactively offer a \"Twitter media workshop to update you on Twitter's media solutions and showcase the best way to utilise the platform from a campaign perspective.\" This highlights the inherent power imbalance: a private, profit-driven entity offering \"solutions\" to a government regulator, rather than simply being subject to regulations. This suggests corporations are not just complying but are actively involved in determining the *mechanisms* of compliance, potentially to their own commercial advantage.\n    *   The focus on \"paid electoral advertisements\" underscores how financial resources can leverage corporate platforms to amplify political messages. While the AEC aims for transparency of authorship, the underlying issue of wealth influencing electoral discourse through paid content on these platforms remains unaddressed by the Act itself.\n\n3.  **Civil Liberties (Freedom of Speech vs. Public Interest):**\n    *   The Act's narrow focus on authorization, rather than content accuracy, represents a particular interpretation of freedom of speech that prioritizes the speaker's right to disseminate information without government scrutiny over the public's right to accurate information in a democratic context. From a progressive viewpoint, absolute freedom of speech should not extend to deliberate disinformation that undermines public trust or manipulates democratic outcomes, particularly when propagated by powerful actors or through paid means.\n    *   The scenarios also involve Twitter being asked to \"remove or block\" non-compliant communications and, in more serious cases, to \"provide the AEC the requested information\" about responsible persons or entities. While this is necessary for enforcement, it vests significant power in a private company (Twitter) to act as a gatekeeper of political speech and to share user data with government, raising questions about accountability, transparency in content moderation decisions, and potential implications for privacy and surveillance if not strictly limited and overseen.\n\nIn summary, while the AEC's efforts to ensure transparency in electoral communication authorship align with basic democratic principles, the documents reveal a regulatory framework (and its application) that falls short of progressive ideals by failing to address the fundamental issue of misinformation, allowing powerful corporations to maintain significant influence over the digital public square, and potentially creating an environment where wealth can distort democratic discourse, all while operating under a narrow interpretation of civil liberties that prioritizes attribution over accuracy and the public good.", "model": "gemini-2.5-flash", "generated_at": "2025-06-22T22:08:10.822476", "source_hash": "cabbc7a4707f1bcfcf542b2512cea0f05da2fbad748fde78ac4e88c872bdead7", "raw_response_path": "data/llm_responses/LS7344__overall__left_leaning__20250622T220810.json", "output_tokens": 773, "prompt_tokens": 4859, "total_tokens": 7484, "summary_length": 4520}, "short_index": {"text": "The FOI documents show that while the Australian Electoral Commission's focus on transparent attribution in electoral communications aligns with progressive values of democratic transparency, the underlying regulatory framework falls significantly short of left-leaning ideals.

This framework also highlights a concerning power imbalance, where powerful tech corporations like Twitter actively shape their regulatory environment and benefit from the amplification of political messages through paid content, allowing wealth to unduly influence public discourse.

The Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) is seen attempting to offload its enforcement responsibilities onto Twitter, demanding the company implement content removal or blocking for non-compliant electoral communications and threatening legal action if it fails to do so.\n\nFrom a conservative perspective, this presents several significant deviations from core principles:\n\n*   **Economic Efficiency & Fiscal Responsibility:** The AEC's proposed framework effectively turns Twitter into an unpaid enforcement arm of the government. This imposes significant, uncompensated compliance costs and operational burdens on a private enterprise, diverting resources from innovation and value creation towards government-mandated content policing. It represents a subtle but impactful form of regulatory tax on the private sector, externalizing government expenses rather than transparently funding them through taxpayer dollars. This is fiscally irresponsible for the government, as it avoids direct costs by imposing them on the private sector.\n*   **Individual Liberty & Limited Government:** The most striking deviation is the threat to individual liberty and free speech. The AEC demands Twitter 'remove or block' content that lacks specific government-mandated authorization, including anonymous communications. While the stated aim is transparency\u2014allowing voters to know who is behind a message\u2014the mechanism chosen involves government-coerced censorship by a private platform. This is a significant overreach of government power, compelling a private entity to limit the expression of its users based on regulatory labels rather than factual accuracy (as the AEC notes, the Act 'does not regulate truth in electoral communications'). This actively undermines the principle of limited government by expanding state control over information flow and private sector operations, transforming a platform into a de facto regulatory agent.\n*   **National Security:** These documents do not directly address national security concerns; their focus is on domestic electoral compliance and transparency rather than foreign interference or cyber threats.", "model": "gemini-2.5-flash", "generated_at": "2025-06-22T22:08:37.403956", "source_hash": "cabbc7a4707f1bcfcf542b2512cea0f05da2fbad748fde78ac4e88c872bdead7", "raw_response_path": "data/llm_responses/LS7344__overall__right_leaning__20250622T220837.json", "output_tokens": 390, "prompt_tokens": 4859, "total_tokens": 7876, "summary_length": 2328}, "short_index": {"text": "These FOI documents reveal a concerning expansion of government power as the Australian Electoral Commission attempts to offload its enforcement responsibilities onto Twitter, effectively turning the private company into an unpaid content policing arm.

Notably, while the request encompassed both Facebook and Twitter, only documents pertaining to Twitter were provided, immediately raising questions about the completeness of the disclosure or the extent of government engagement with other major platforms.\n\nThe documents primarily detail exchanges from August 2018, illustrating a cooperative relationship where Twitter's representatives meet with the AEC, expressing a desire to \"develop detailed and efficient ways to handle any issues that might arise during future campaigns and elections.\" This language, while seemingly innocuous, can be interpreted as a proactive move towards managing and potentially limiting public discourse on the platform under the guise of \"efficiency.\"\n\nFurther blurring the lines between regulation and corporate influence, Twitter offered to conduct a \"media workshop\" for AEC staff, framed as an update on \"Twitter's media solutions\" and showcasing \"the best way to utilise the platform from a campaign perspective.\" This suggests the AEC, the body responsible for fair elections, might be receiving guidance or even implicit direction on campaigning from a private entity with its own commercial interests, potentially creating an uneven playing field or subtly endorsing certain campaign methods. This also raises questions about potential waste of public resources if the AEC is relying on such external, potentially biased, \"training.\"\n\nThe most significant revelations come from the AEC's proposals for managing electoral communications on Twitter. The AEC outlines scenarios where it would request Twitter to \"remove or block\" content deemed non-compliant with authorisation requirements, including anonymous communications or paid ads lacking proper disclosure. This indicates a direct outsourcing of content moderation and potential censorship power from an Australian government agency to a foreign private company, bypassing formal Australian judicial processes and creating an unaccountable system for determining what content is permissible.\n\nEven more concerning is the AEC's stated intent to seek \"further details on the person or entity responsible\" for content that \"may breach more serious electoral offences,\" such as those \"likely to mislead or deceive an elector.\" While the Electoral Act is explicitly stated not to regulate \"truth in electoral communications,\" the AEC's interest in \"misleading or deceptive\" content suggests a creeping overreach into content regulation beyond simple authorisation. This also raises significant privacy concerns, as Twitter is implicitly expected to share user data with the government, or at the very least, make determinations about users' identities and compliance without full transparency to the public or independent oversight.\n\nFinally, the AEC's explicit warning that it \"may get an injunction\" against Twitter if the platform \"is unable to remove or block a communication... or cannot provide information\" serves as a thinly veiled threat. This highlights the coercive power the government is willing to wield over private companies to ensure compliance with its content management demands, demonstrating a pattern of exerting control over digital information flows through external intermediaries rather than direct, transparent government action with clear accountability.\n\nIn sum, these documents paint a picture of a government agency actively seeking to control electoral discourse online through a private platform, raising serious questions about transparency, due process, potential overreach into content regulation, and the outsourcing of censorship to a foreign corporation under implicit coercion. The absence of Facebook documents further casts doubt on the completeness of information provided under the FOI.", "model": "gemini-2.5-flash", "generated_at": "2025-06-22T22:09:02.057641", "source_hash": "cabbc7a4707f1bcfcf542b2512cea0f05da2fbad748fde78ac4e88c872bdead7", "raw_response_path": "data/llm_responses/LS7344__overall__government_skeptic__20250622T220901.json", "output_tokens": 692, "prompt_tokens": 4855, "total_tokens": 7237, "summary_length": 4131}, "short_index": {"text": "The released FOI documents expose a concerning degree of collaboration between the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) and Twitter, detailing a government regulator's proactive attempts to control online electoral discourse through a foreign private corporation, notably lacking any correspondence with Facebook.

The evidence points to gross incompetence, reactive instead of proactive measures, and a disturbing deferral of regulatory authority to foreign technology giants.\n\n**1. Glaring Omission and Apparent Negligence:**\nThe FOI request explicitly sought \"All correspondence about compliance with the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 between the Australian Election Commission and the US technology companies Facebook Inc. and Twitter Inc. since July 2017.\"\n*   **The Damning Reality:** The \"Schedule of Relevant Documents\" lists a paltry four emails, all exclusively with *Twitter*, and all confined to a mere nine-day window in August 2018. There is a complete and inexplicable absence of *any* correspondence with Facebook Inc., a dominant platform with immense electoral influence, spanning over a year and leading up to a federal election. This is either:\n    *   **Deliberate Concealment:** A ruthless refusal to fully comply with the FOI request, indicating a conscious decision to hide the extent of AEC's inaction or sensitive exchanges.\n    *   **Abject Incompetence:** The AEC failed to maintain proper records of critical communications, or their record-keeping is so disorganised they couldn't locate relevant documents.\n    *   **Shocking Dereliction of Duty:** The AEC had *no significant engagement whatsoever* with Facebook on electoral compliance for over a year leading up to a federal election. This represents an astonishing dereliction of its fundamental duty to ensure a fair and compliant electoral process in the digital age, leaving a massive vector for manipulation wide open.\n\n**2. Belated, Reactive, and Toothless Engagement:**\nThe correspondence reveals a desperate, last-minute scramble by the AEC to engage with Twitter less than a year before the May 2019 federal election.\n*   **Meeting Agenda - A Sales Pitch?** The initial emails (Docs 1, 2, 3) are alarmingly cordial, with Twitter offering \"detailed and efficient ways to handle any issues\" and even a \"media workshop to update you on Twitter's media solutions and showcase the best way to utilise the platform from a campaign perspective.\" This suggests the AEC was treated more like a potential client or partner than a robust regulator asserting its authority.\n*   **\"Scenarios\" - An Admission of Weakness:** Document 4, AEC's \"scenarios,\" exposes the AEC's shocking lack of direct enforcement power. Its \"plan\" is to \"notify Twitter\" and *ask* the company to \"remove or block\" non-compliant content. The AEC is effectively begging a foreign corporation to enforce Australian law, rather than possessing the direct legal or technical means to do so itself. This is a profound regulatory failure, placing the integrity of Australian elections at the mercy of a private company's goodwill and internal policies.\n*   **Relinquishing Sovereignty:** In Scenario 2, Twitter is asked to \"confirm whether a person or entity is a disclosure entity\" to \"avoid the need to share personal or commercial information with the AEC.\" This implies the AEC lacks the independent capability or willingness to identify such entities itself, or is overly deferential to Twitter's privacy concerns, allowing a foreign company to act as a gatekeeper for Australian electoral law. This is a humiliating concession of sovereign authority over election integrity.\n*   **The \"Injunction\" Threat - A Last Resort of the Desperate:** The AEC's ultimate \"recourse\" is an injunction, explicitly stated as potentially against Twitter itself. This is not a strong enforcement mechanism but a costly, time-consuming legal battle, highlighting the AEC's shocking lack of direct, nimble, and effective tools to manage real-time online threats. It underscores that their \"agreed process\" is fundamentally non-binding and relies on voluntary compliance, not enforceable regulation.\n\n**3. Critical Systemic Flaws in Australian Electoral Law (and AEC's Inability to Address Them):**\nDocument 4 contains a truly damning admission: \"The Electoral Act does not regulate truth in electoral communications.\"\n*   **Open Door for Disinformation:** In an era rife with sophisticated disinformation campaigns, this is a catastrophic legislative void. The AEC's focus is narrowly on \"authorisation requirements\" (who paid/published), largely ignoring the *content* and *veracity* of electoral messaging unless it directly \"mislead[s] or deceive[s] an elector in relation to the casting of a vote\" (a high bar). This legal loophole provides a fertile ground for anonymous, false, or misleading information to spread unchecked, fundamentally undermining the democratic process.\n*   **Narrow Focus - Broad Consequences:** The AEC's rigid adherence to a law primarily designed for traditional print media, without robust amendments for the digital age, demonstrates a profound failure of foresight and adaptability. By focusing solely on attribution and not content integrity, the AEC is essentially permitting the electoral landscape to be polluted with unchecked deception, so long as it\u2019s not paid advertising from a disclosure entity, or not misleading about the act of voting itself.\n\nIn conclusion, these FOI documents do not show a proactive, powerful, or effective regulator. Instead, they expose an Australian Electoral Commission that was embarrassingly behind the curve, engaging in a polite, toothless dance with a single major platform, while simultaneously admitting its legal framework was fundamentally inadequate to combat the pervasive disinformation threatening the integrity of Australian democracy.

At the meeting I said I would provide some \nscenarios on how we can manage electoral communications on Twitter that do not comply \nwith the authorisation requirements in the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 (Electoral \nAct).  The closer the electoral communication is to a Federal election the more urgent it will \nbe to either obtain prompt compliance with the Electoral Act or to block or remove the \nnon-compliant communication.  To this end the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) is \nkeen to agree on the process with Twitter for escalating and resolving any such matters.   \n\nI have set out below three scenarios.  The first two scenarios are the most likely occur, the \nthird scenario will only arise if the AEC is concerned that a communication may breach more \nserious electoral offences in Part XXI of the Electoral Act.  For each scenario I have outlined \nthe actions the AEC will take, when we will contact you and the assistance we will require \nfrom Twitter.  For completeness I have included a summary of the authorisation \nrequirements in the Electoral Act.   \n\nGiven the increasing use of social media by political participants, we are interested in your \nviews on the processes suggested below for escalating and resolving any Electoral Act \ncompliance issues that may arise with electoral communications on social media. \n\nKind regards \n\nAndrew Johnson | Principal Government Lawyer \nElectoral Authorisation Section | Legal & Procurement Branch \nAustralian Electoral Commission \nT: (02) 6271 4759 | M: \n\n7LS7344 Released Document No 4Released under the Freedom of Information Act 1982\n\n\n--- Page 2 ---\n\nAuthorisation of electoral communications on \nsocial media scenarios \n\n1.  Paid electoral advertisement on Twitter without proper authorisation \n\nIssue:  Paid electoral advertisements require an authorisation to allow voters to know who is \n\ncommunicating the advertisement. \n\nActions: \n\nEvent \nUnauthorised electoral ad on \nTwitter  \n\nEntity \nAEC \n\nInadequate response from \nperson or entity responsible \nfor the electoral ad \nAEC notifies Twitter of the \nunauthorised electoral ad \n\nAEC \n\nTwitter \n\nAction \nContact or attempt to contact the person or entity \nresponsible for the electoral ad to advise of the legal \nrequirements in the Electoral Act and ask them to \nrectify or remove the ad. \nNotify Twitter of an unauthorised electoral ad on \nsocial media site. \n\nRemove or block the electoral ad, or contact the \nperson or entity responsible for the ad and advise \nthem to add an authorisation or have the ad \nremoved or blocked. \n\n2.  Anonymous communication on Twitter containing electoral matter \n\nIssue:  AEC unable to determine whether an anonymous communication is electoral matter that \n\nrequires an authorisation under the Electoral Act. \n\nActions: \n\nEvent \nAnonymous communication \ncontaining electoral matter on \nTwitter \n\nEntity \nAEC \n\nInadequate response from \nperson or entity responsible for \nthe anonymous electoral \ncommunication \nAEC notifies Twitter of the \nelectoral communication and the \nneed to settle whether the \nresponsible person or entity is a \ndisclosure entity \nConfirm the person or entity \nresponsible for the electoral \ncommunication is: * \n\uf0b7  not a disclosure entity  \n\nAEC \n\nTwitter \n\nTwitter \n\nAction \nContact or attempt to contact the person or \nentity responsible for the electoral \ncommunication to ascertain whether they are a \ndisclosure entity and advise of the legal \nrequirements for disclosure entities to authorise \nelectoral communications. \nNotify Twitter of an anonymous communication \ncontaining electoral matter and the need to \nascertain whether the responsible person or \nentity is a disclosure entity. \nContact the person or entity responsible for the \nelectoral communication to advise of the \nauthorisation requirements in the Electoral Act.   \n\n\uf0b7  Advise the AEC. No further action. \n\nLS7344 Released Document No 4Released under the Freedom of Information Act 1982\n\n\n--- Page 3 ---\n\n\uf0b7  a disclosure entity  \n\n\uf0b7  Advise the AEC. Remove or block the \n\ncommunication if the responsible person \nor entity does not take action to add an \nauthorisation in compliance with the \nElectoral Act. \n\n*   If Twitter is able to confirm whether a person or entity is a disclosure entity, this will \navoid the need to share personal or commercial information with the AEC.  AEC can \nprovide advice on the categories of a persons or entities that are disclosure entities for \nthe purposes of the Electoral Act.   \n\n3.  Paid electoral advertisement on Twitter that infringes other offences in \n\nthe Electoral Act  \n\nIssue:  In addition to the issues raised above, the AEC may need further details on the person or \nentity responsible for an electoral communication to consider other civil or criminal action \nunder the Electoral Act.  For example it is an offence under section 329 of the Electoral Act to \npublish or distribute or cause to be published or distributed any electoral communication that \nis likely to mislead or deceive an elector in relation to the casting of a vote. \n\nActions:  In addition to the actions outlined above: \n\nEvent \nIncomplete information on the \nperson or entity responsible for \nan electoral communication on \nsocial media \nRequest from the AEC for \ninformation \n\nEntity \nAEC \n\nAction \nSeek information from Twitter about the person \nor entity responsible for the communication. \n\nTwitter \n\nProvide the AEC the requested information. \n\nIn any of the above scenarios, if Twitter is unable to remove or block a communication that does not \ncomply with the Electoral Act or cannot provide information about the person or entity responsible \nfor the communication, then the AEC (or a candidate in an election) may get an injunction under \nsection 383 of the Electoral Act against the person or entity responsible for the communication \nand/or Twitter. \n\nBackground \nThe Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 (Electoral Act) is concerned that voters know who is \ncommunicating an electoral matter to them (electoral communication).  The Electoral Act does not \nregulate truth in electoral communications.  Part XXA of the Electoral Act requires electoral \ncommunications to have an authorisation to inform voters who is responsible for the \ncommunication. \n\nFor a social media communication to be an electoral communication requiring an authorisation \nunder section 321D of the Electoral Act, the communication must: \n\n\uf0b7 \n\ncontain electoral matter, and \n\n\uf0b7  be at least one of the following: \n\no  a paid electoral advertisement, \n\nLS7344 Released Document No 4Released under the Freedom of Information Act 1982\n\n\n--- Page 4 ---\n\no  a matter communicated by, on behalf of, a disclosure entity. \n\n\u2018Electoral matter\u2019 is defined in section 4(1) of the Electoral Act as \u2018matter which is intended or likely \nto affect voting in an election\u2019. For the purpose of the authorisation requirements in Part XXA of the \nElectoral Act, paragraph 4(9)(b) clarifies that there must be a sufficient connection between the \nsubject matters of federal elections:  \n\n(9)   Without limiting the definition of electoral matter in subsection (1), matter is taken to be \n\nintended or likely to affect voting in an election if: \n\n(b)    \u2026 in Part XXA\u2014it contains an express or implicit reference to: \n\n(i)    the election; or \n\n(ii)   a political party, a branch or division of a political party or a candidate or group \n\nof candidates in the election; or \n\n(iii)  an issue submitted to, or otherwise before, the electors in connection with the \n\nelection. \n\n\u2018Disclosure entity\u2019 is defined in section 321B of the Electoral Act to be a political party, associated \nentity, member of the House of Representatives, Senator, a candidate or group of candidates in a \nfederal election or other persons or entities who engage in the electoral process and are required by \nthe Electoral Act to provide a return. \n\nFrom: Evan Ekin-Smyth  \nSent: Thursday, 23 August 2018 10:54 AM \nTo: Emily Foat <emilyfoat@twitter.com>; Kara Hinesley <khinesley@twitter.com> \nCc: Tim Courtney <Tim.Courtney@aec.gov.au>; Andrew Johnson <Andrew.Johnson@aec.gov.au> \nSubject: RE: Twitter Follow-up [DLM=For-Official-Use-Only] \n\nThanks Kara and Emily \u2013 it was certainly good to meet you both and talk through election \nscenarios.  \n\nKara, I imagine Andrew will send through a specific scenario just to bed in what we were \ntalking about.
