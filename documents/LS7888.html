      <p>The following is a summary of the FOI request LS7888 and its associated released documents:</p>
<h3>Main Purpose of the FOI Request</h3>
<p>The Freedom of Information (FOI) request LS7888 sought documents from January 1, 2018, to December 31, 2019, concerning the Australian Electoral Commission's (AEC) new methodology for its Indigenous Electoral Participation Program (IEPP). Specifically, the request aimed to uncover:<br />
*   Planning documents and the catalyst for the new methodology.<br />
*   Progress reports and internal communications regarding its design, testing, and implementation.<br />
*   Details on how implementation was tracked, including comparisons with prior methodologies.<br />
*   Final summary reports on the outcomes.<br />
*   Information on the number of Indigenous people involved in the planning, design, and implementation.<br />
*   The final cost of the methodology's design, testing, and implementation, including AEC staffer numbers.</p>
<h3>Documents from the FOI Request</h3>
<p>The released documents comprise a schedule of 41 items (some subsuming others) and several redacted document excerpts. The types of documents include:<br />
*   <strong>Internal Emails:</strong> Correspondence between various AEC staff members (Assistant Directors, Directors, Senior Project Officers, Consultants, Data Analysts) discussing Indigenous data, enrolment rates, parliamentary reviews, and ministerial briefings.<br />
*   <strong>Papers/Reports:</strong> Documents titled "Indigenous Franchise KPIs using Centrelink data" and "Analysis of Indigenous Enrolment."<br />
*   <strong>Ministerial Submissions &amp; Briefs:</strong> Formal documents prepared for Ministers and parliamentary estimates hearings (e.g., "Ministerial Submission re Publication of Indigenous enrolment rates," "Estimates Brief – Hot Issue re Indigenous," "Estimates Brief – Hot Issue – Supplementary Budget Estimates").<br />
*   <strong>Redaction Codes List:</strong> A list detailing the types of information redacted from the documents.</p>
<h3>Main Content from the FOI Request Documents</h3>
<p>The core content of the released documents focuses heavily on the AEC's shift to a new, more direct methodology for estimating Indigenous electoral enrolment rates, primarily leveraging self-identified Indigeneity data from Centrelink (Department of Human Services).</p>
<p><strong>Key Insights from the Documents:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Catalyst for New Methodology:</strong> The availability of person-level Centrelink extracts that included an Indigenous indicator from 2017 onwards was the primary catalyst. Previously, the AEC used an indirect regression model, which yielded "alarmingly low" and less robust Indigenous enrolment rates.</li>
<li><strong>New Methodology Details:</strong> The new approach involves:<ul>
<li>Calculating the proportion of Centrelink customers (with identified Indigenous or non-Indigenous status) who are on the electoral roll.</li>
<li>Adjusting these raw Centrelink-based rates to align with overall AEC enrolment rates, applying this factor to Indigenous and non-Indigenous data.</li>
<li>The methodology aims to provide more direct and robust estimates, though it still relies on assumptions (e.g., no bias in Centrelink client enrolment or matching for Indigenous/non-Indigenous individuals).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Improved Enrolment Rates:</strong> The new methodology revealed significantly higher estimated Indigenous enrolment rates:<ul>
<li>As at June 30, 2018, the national Indigenous enrolment rate was estimated at <strong>76.4%</strong>. This was a substantial increase from the previous estimates of <strong>58%</strong> (calculated in 2014 using the old methodology).</li>
<li>As at June 30, 2019, the national rate remained steady at <strong>76.6%</strong>, continuing an upward trend from 74.7% in 2017.</li>
<li>The estimated unenrolled Indigenous population was around 118,581 in June 2018, increasing slightly to 120,486 by June 2019.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Implementation Tracking &amp; Enrolment Stimulation:</strong><ul>
<li>The Centrelink data identified 72,451 "potentially unenrolled Indigenous Australians" in July 2018.</li>
<li>An enrolment stimulation event in February/March 2019 resulted in 2,646 Indigenous Australians enrolling, reducing the identified unenrolled cohort to 69,143.</li>
<li>Internal discussions reveal efforts to refine the data analysis, particularly concerning older Indigenous Australians and potential matching errors.</li>
<li>There were internal discussions (emails from Sept 2019) about state-level variations, such as a noted increase in the unenrolled Indigenous population in NSW, though it was deemed not statistically significant given the state's size.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Reporting and Transparency:</strong> The AEC prepared ministerial submissions and estimates briefs to communicate these updated enrolment figures to the government and parliament, emphasizing the improved methodology and increased rates. Discussions noted the importance of clearly stating the estimated nature of the data ("estimates on top of estimates") due to the lack of a direct Indigenous identifier on the federal roll.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Information Not Explicitly Addressed in Released Content:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The documents do not explicitly outline the <strong>number of Indigenous people involved by the AEC in the planning, design, and implementation</strong> of the new methodology in terms of project personnel or consultants.</li>
<li>The documents also do not detail the <strong>final cost of the design, testing, and implementation of the new methodology, nor the specific number of AEC staffers assigned to the task.</strong> While staff names and roles appear in emails, a dedicated breakdown of staffing or costs for the project is not present in the provided snippets or document descriptions.</li>

    <div class="ai-summary-markdown-content">
      <p>As a politically left-leaning analyst, the Freedom of Information (FOI) documents relating to the Australian Electoral Commission's (AEC) Indigenous Electoral Participation Program (IEPP) between 2018 and 2019 reveal a mixed picture regarding their alignment with progressive values, particularly concerning social justice and civil liberties.</p>
<p><strong>Social Justice: Addressing Electoral Disparity</strong></p>
<p>The documents highlight a clear recognition by the AEC of a significant disparity in Indigenous electoral enrolment rates compared to the general population. In 2017, internal AEC research suggested around 42% of Indigenous people were not enrolled to vote, compared to a much lower non-Indigenous non-enrolment rate (29% vs. 3% in 2017, respectively). This stark difference underscores a fundamental social justice issue: unequal access to democratic participation for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples.</p>
<p>The AEC's new methodology, relying on self-identified Indigeneity data from Centrelink (Department of Human Services), represents a pragmatic effort to improve the accuracy of Indigenous enrolment estimates and to better target unenrolled individuals. This initiative aligns with progressive values that seek to dismantle barriers to participation and promote equity, especially for historically marginalized groups, and is explicitly linked to "Closing the Gap" objectives. Progress is noted, with national Indigenous enrolment rates estimated to have risen from 74.7% in 2017 to 76.6% in 2019. The "enrolment stimulation event" in early 2019, which enrolled 2,646 Indigenous Australians, demonstrates a proactive approach to rectify historical under-enrolment.</p>
<p>However, a critical progressive concern emerges from the documents: the continued absence of a direct Indigenous identifier on the federal electoral roll. This systemic issue forces the AEC to rely on indirect methods, such as data matching with Centrelink. The documents repeatedly caveat these estimates as "indicative only" and based on "courageous assumptions," implying inherent limitations and a less-than-ideal solution. The reliance on Centrelink data, while practical, also means targeting primarily those Indigenous Australians who are already engaging with social security services and have self-identified within that system, potentially missing other unenrolled individuals.</p>
<p>Furthermore, a notable anomaly appears in the 2019 data, where the estimated unenrolled Indigenous population in New South Wales significantly increased by 10.9% (from 20,954 to 23,239), despite overall national improvements. This suggests that the new methodologies might not be consistently effective across all regions or that other structural factors are at play, warranting deeper investigation from a social justice perspective.</p>
<p>Crucially, the FOI request explicitly asked for "documentation... outlining the number of Indigenous people involved by the AEC in the planning, design and implementation of the new methodology." The released documents contain <strong>no information</strong> addressing this vital request. From a left-leaning standpoint, the lack of demonstrated Indigenous involvement in a program specifically designed to enhance their electoral participation is a significant deviation from principles of self-determination and co-design, raising questions about the authenticity and effectiveness of the initiative's community engagement.</p>
<p><strong>Civil Liberties: Data Sharing and Privacy</strong></p>
<p>The use of Centrelink data for electoral purposes raises important civil liberties concerns related to privacy and inter-agency data sharing. While framed as a necessary tool to address the lack of an Indigenous identifier on the electoral roll, the linkage of sensitive personal information (Indigenous status, welfare recipient data) with electoral records warrants scrutiny. The documents do not detail whether explicit consent is sought from individuals for this data sharing or the robustness of privacy safeguards in place. For progressive analysts, this highlights a potential erosion of individual privacy and the blurring of lines between social support and civic duties, especially when compulsory enrolment is involved.</p>
<p><strong>Other Issues: Environmental Impact, Wealth Distribution, Corporate Influence</strong></p>
<p>The provided documents do not contain information related to environmental impact, wealth distribution beyond the indirect implication of Centrelink data usage, or corporate influence on the IEPP or AEC policies.</p>
<p><strong>Overall Progressive Assessment</strong></p>
<p>While the AEC's efforts to improve Indigenous electoral enrolment are commendable and align with the progressive goal of universal suffrage and social justice, the documents reveal critical shortcomings. The persistent reliance on indirect, "indicative only" data due to the lack of a direct Indigenous identifier on the electoral roll itself points to a systemic failing. Furthermore, the absence of transparency regarding Indigenous involvement in the program's design and implementation, coupled with unresolved questions around data privacy in inter-agency sharing, raises significant concerns about the depth of commitment to genuine self-determination and robust civil liberties within this critical initiative.</p>

      <p>The Australian Electoral Commission's (AEC) efforts to reform its Indigenous Electoral Participation Program (IEPP) methodology during 2018-2019, as revealed by these FOI documents, present a mixed picture when viewed through a conservative lens. While ostensibly aimed at improving electoral integrity and participation, the actions highlight areas of concern regarding fiscal responsibility, individual liberty, and the scope of government.</p>
<p><strong>Economic Efficiency and Fiscal Responsibility:</strong><br />
The documents indicate a shift by the AEC from less reliable "indirect estimation" methods to a "more direct method" of calculating Indigenous enrolment rates, primarily by leveraging self-identified Indigeneity data from the Department of Human Services (Centrelink). This is presented as leading to "more robust results." From an efficiency standpoint, utilizing existing government data sources, rather than developing entirely new collection mechanisms, could be seen as a sensible approach to resource allocation. However, a significant deviation from conservative principles of fiscal transparency is evident: the FOI request explicitly sought details on the "final cost of the design, testing and implementation of the new methodology" and the "number of AEC staffers assigned," yet <strong>no such financial or staffing information is provided in the released documents.</strong> This lack of accountability for public expenditure on a new program or methodology is a serious concern, preventing a proper cost-benefit analysis and hindering oversight of taxpayer funds. The mention of "enrolment stimulation events" in February/March 2019, which led to the enrolment of 2,646 Indigenous Australians, represents a direct programmatic expense whose cost remains undisclosed.</p>
<p><strong>Individual Liberty and Limited Government:</strong><br />
The core of the new methodology relies on the AEC accessing and matching individuals' self-identified Indigenous status from Centrelink records with the electoral roll. While the AEC states that the electoral roll itself "does not have a personal Indigenous identifier," this inter-agency data sharing effectively creates a de facto administrative identifier, raising significant questions about data privacy and the expanding reach of government. For conservatives, who advocate for limited government and strong protections for individual liberty, the aggregation and cross-use of personal data across different government functions (welfare administration and electoral management) can be viewed as an encroachment on privacy. The stated purpose of this data use, to "enhance Indigenous enrolment" for "Closing the Gap purposes," while presented as a social good, also highlights an expansion of the AEC's role beyond its core function of maintaining an accurate and fair electoral roll to active participation in social engineering outcomes. This active pursuit of specific demographic enrolment rates, rather than a neutral, universal application of electoral law, deviates from the principle of a strictly limited government.</p>
<p><strong>Outcomes and Deviations:</strong><br />
The new methodology has reportedly led to an increase in estimated national Indigenous enrolment rates, rising from a previously "alarmingly low" 58% (2014) to 76.4% in June 2018 and 76.6% in June 2019. While an overall improvement in enrolment is desirable for a robust democracy, the internal documents also highlight an 11% increase in the estimated <em>unenrolled</em> Indigenous population in New South Wales between 2018 and 2019, prompting internal questions about the data's nuances. This fluctuation, coupled with the inherent "courageous assumptions" acknowledged in the methodology, reinforces the conservative view that complex government interventions, particularly those involving extensive data aggregation and social objectives, often lack precision and can obscure true efficacy while increasing administrative burden and reducing transparency.</p>
<p>In conclusion, these documents reveal the AEC's initiative to improve Indigenous electoral participation through a data-driven methodology. However, the undisclosed costs, the reliance on cross-agency data sharing impacting individual privacy, and the broader "Closing the Gap" mandate that pushes the AEC into social policy territory, represent significant deviations from conservative principles of fiscal responsibility, individual liberty, and limited government. The lack of transparency surrounding the financial aspects of this program remains a key concern.</p>

    <div class="ai-summary-markdown-content">
      <p>The Australian Electoral Commission's (AEC) response to FOI request LS7888 reveals a troubling lack of transparency, questionable data manipulation, and apparent inefficiency in its Indigenous Electoral Participation Program (IEPP) during 2018-2019.</p>
<p>Despite requests for comprehensive documentation on planning, progress, indigenous involvement, and costs, the AEC released a limited set of emails and internal briefs. Notably absent are detailed planning documents, formal progress reports, any figures on Indigenous people involved in the program's design, and crucially, any information on the final cost or staffing allocated to this "new methodology." This withholding of basic accountability metrics immediately raises suspicions of a deliberate lack of transparency regarding public funds and genuine community engagement.</p>
<p>The "new methodology" itself appears to be less about tangible improvements in Indigenous enrolment and more about an advantageous shift in measurement. Previously, the AEC's own 2014 research indicated an "alarmingly low" Indigenous enrolment rate of around 58%. The new approach, leveraging Centrelink data, conveniently presented a dramatically "improved" rate of 76.4% in 2018, rising slightly to 76.6% in 2019. However, internal documents reveal this new method relies on "courageous assumptions" and produces figures that "should nevertheless still be regarded as indicative only" and "not and cannot be considered 100% accurate." The Deputy Electoral Commissioner explicitly warned against the "critical context" of these caveats being "lost over time," implying a risk of deliberate misrepresentation at higher levels.</p>
<p>Further scrutiny reveals significant operational inefficiencies. A key "enrolment stimulation event" in early 2019, targeting over 72,000 "potentially unenrolled Indigenous Australians" identified through the new data, resulted in a meager 2,646 enrolments—a conversion rate of approximately 3.6%. This constitutes a significant waste of resources on an ineffective outreach strategy. Internal emails also highlight persistent data quality issues, such as "significant matching error" for older Indigenous Australians, undermining the very "robustness" claimed for the new methodology. Compounding this, a data analyst noted that 2019 enrolment figures initially looked "strange" and required a "fix" before being reported, raising concerns about the reliability and rigor of internal reporting.</p>
<p>In essence, the documents suggest that rather than genuinely addressing the deep-seated issues leading to low Indigenous enrolment, the AEC focused on a new, statistically dubious methodology that presented a more palatable picture. The lack of transparent reporting on costs, staffing, and genuine Indigenous involvement, coupled with the demonstrably inefficient outreach efforts and internal data integrity concerns, points to a bureaucratic exercise more focused on managing perception than achieving substantive outcomes.</p>

      <p>The released FOI documents demonstrate the government's proactive and effective efforts, through the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC), to enhance the Indigenous Electoral Participation Program (IEPP) during 2018 and 2019. This initiative underscores a deep commitment to effective governance, necessary regulatory improvement, and positive public outcomes, particularly for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities.</p>
<p>The catalyst for a new methodology was a clear recognition that previous enrolment rate estimations, which were acknowledged as less robust, required significant improvement to support "Closing the Gap" objectives. The AEC embarked on a rigorous planning phase, shifting from indirect modelling to a more direct approach leveraging self-identified Indigeneity data from the Department of Human Services (Centrelink). This inter-agency collaboration facilitated a data-driven strategy to better understand and boost Indigenous electoral participation.</p>
<p>Throughout the design, testing, and implementation phases, the AEC maintained diligent progress reporting and internal review processes. Documents highlight meticulous data cleansing and analysis, showcasing the agency's dedication to accuracy. Challenges, such as refining data quality for specific demographics or addressing minor, statistically insignificant fluctuations in state-level enrolment figures, were actively managed as part of a continuous improvement cycle, ensuring the robustness of the new methodology.</p>
<p>The outcomes of this new methodology have been overwhelmingly positive. Comparisons with prior estimates reveal a significant improvement in national Indigenous enrolment rates, rising from a previous estimate of 58% to 76.4% in 2018, and further stabilising at 76.6% in 2019. This demonstrates that Indigenous enrolment has grown at a faster pace than the overall electoral roll. A notable success was an enrolment stimulation event in early 2019, which directly resulted in thousands of previously unenrolled Indigenous Australians joining the roll, proving the tangible impact of these targeted efforts.</p>
<p>While the documents primarily focus on the technical and analytical aspects of the methodology, the program's very existence, its commitment to "Closing the Gap," and its detailed analysis down to electoral division levels, reflect the government's dedication to serving Indigenous Australians. This data informs highly targeted community engagement strategies and supports crucial services like Remote Area Mobile Polling, all aimed at empowering full electoral participation. The deep involvement of AEC staffers across multiple branches and levels, from data analysts to the Electoral Commissioner, highlights a dedicated public service effort, committed to ensuring the integrity and inclusivity of Australia's democratic process. Details regarding the number of Indigenous people involved in the program's design, or its specific costs, were not part of the released documents, but the consistent improvements in Indigenous enrolment rates stand as a testament to the program's effectiveness.</p>

                  <p>This document is a "SCHEDULE OF RELEASED DOCUMENTS" for FOI Request LS7888, listing 40 documents released by the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) spanning from March 2018 to October 2019. It details various internal communications, minutes, and papers concerning the AEC's new methodology for estimating Indigenous electoral enrolment rates, primarily utilising Centrelink (DHS) data.</p>
<p><strong>Relevance to FOI Request LS7888:</strong></p>
<p>The schedule directly addresses several aspects of the FOI request:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Planning for the new methodology and catalyst (point 1):</strong> The schedule lists a "Minute... re Using DHS Indigeneity data to enhance Indigenous enrolment" (Doc 4, July 2018) and multiple "Paper titled Indigenous Franchise KPIs using Centrelink data" (undated), which indicate the catalyst (Centrelink data) and planning efforts.</li>
<li><strong>Progress reports (point 2):</strong> Numerous emails between AEC staff, particularly those regarding "Indigenous data," "Indigenous population statistics," and "Parliamentary review" (e.g., Docs 12-18, Docs 21-28), serve as progress updates on the design, testing, and implementation.</li>
<li><strong>Tracking implementation and comparisons (point 3):</strong> The inclusion of "Paper titled Analysis of Indigenous Enrolment" (undated, e.g., Doc 27, Doc 29) and "Indigenous Franchise KPIs using Centrelink data" suggests documents detailing how implementation was tracked and likely include comparisons to prior methodologies, supporting the increased enrolment rates noted in the FOI overview.</li>
<li><strong>Final summary reports on outcomes (point 4):</strong> A "Ministerial Submission... re Publication of Indigenous enrolment rates" (Doc 19, Feb 2019) and "Estimates Brief – Hot Issue... re Indigenous" (Doc 20, Feb 2019; Doc 40, Oct 2019) are listed, which serve as high-level summaries of the methodology's outcomes.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, the schedule <strong>does not list any documents</strong> that explicitly address the following requested items, aligning with the FOI overview's findings:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Number of Indigenous people involved (point 5):</strong> No document description indicates details on Indigenous involvement in the methodology's development.</li>
<li><strong>Final cost and dedicated AEC staffing (point 6):</strong> No document description indicates details on the financial costs or the number of AEC staffers specifically assigned to the task.</li>
</ul>

Indigenous missing [SEC=UNCLASSIFIED]

Delyse, just a note the 42% Indigenous missing. The Indigenous Electoral Participation Program 2016‐17 National 
Program Plan, 22 August 2016 (page 4) states that internal AEC research suggests around 58 per cent are enrolled to 
vote, 
on enrolment (2011) 
and AEC participation statistics in June 2014. 

. This data was sourced from Internal agency research 
conducted by SRA based on ABS Indigenous population data 

This aligns with the Snowden statement in Hansard ‘In addition, in 2014 the AEC had already identified that 42% of 
Indigenous people were not enrolled to vote’.

                    <p>This internal AEC email, dated 4 December 2018, from Guy Lewis to Delyse Paliaga, clarifies the historical baseline for Indigenous electoral enrolment rates. It references the 2016-17 Indigenous Electoral Participation Program (IEPP) National Program Plan, stating that internal AEC research (based on 2011 ABS data and 2014 AEC statistics) estimated approximately 58% of Indigenous Australians were enrolled to vote, meaning 42% were "missing." This figure is corroborated by a 2014 Hansard statement.</p>
<p><strong>Relevance to FOI Request LS7888:</strong></p>
<p>This document is relevant as it establishes the historical context and the "old 2014 methodology" baseline for Indigenous enrolment rates (58% enrolled, or 42% unenrolled) that the FOI request seeks to contrast with the AEC's <em>new</em> methodology. While not detailing the new methodology itself, it provides the prior understanding of Indigenous enrolment that the new approach, with its significantly higher estimated rates (76.4% in June 2018, 76.6% in June 2019), was intended to update and improve upon.</p>

                    <h3>Document Summary</h3>
<p>This document is an email exchange from December 2018 between several Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) staff members, including Guy Lewis, Michael Roden, and Delyse Paliaga. The core discussion revolves around a parliamentary statement made by MP Warren Snowden on 3 December 2018, claiming that "in 2014 the AEC had already identified that 42 per cent of Indigenous people were not enrolled to vote" (implying 58% enrolment).</p>
<ul>
<li>Michael Roden confirms that this 2014 figure likely represents the "first cut" of Indigenous enrolment rates, which was tentatively trialled around four years prior (circa 2014) and "solely using regression methods."</li>
<li>He explicitly states that "Many methodological changes since then" have occurred, leading to a "general improvement in enrolment rates."</li>
<li>Guy Lewis confirms that this 2014 figure was cited in a 2015 Australian National Audit Office (ANAO) report.</li>
<li>The exchange highlights the AEC's internal discussion and clarification regarding historical Indigenous enrolment rate estimates derived from an earlier methodology.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Relevance to FOI Request LS7888</h3>
<p>This document is highly relevant to FOI request LS7888, which sought information on the AEC's <em>new</em> methodology for the Indigenous Electoral Participation Program (IEPP) in 2018-2019.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Context for Methodological Shift:</strong> The FOI overview states that the AEC "transitioned to a more direct method for estimating Indigenous electoral enrolment rates," increasing estimates from "approximately 58% (under the old 2014 methodology)" to over 76% by 2018-2019. This document directly corroborates and provides internal AEC confirmation for the "old 2014 methodology" figure of 58% enrolment (42% unenrolled).</li>
<li><strong>Acknowledgement of Methodological Evolution:</strong> Michael Roden's comment about "many methodological changes since then" explicitly acknowledges the evolution of the AEC's approach to estimating Indigenous enrolment rates, which is central to the FOI request's focus on the "new methodology."</li>
<li><strong>Historical Data Point:</strong> By confirming the source and nature of the 2014 enrolment estimate (regression-based and cited in a 2015 ANAO report), the document provides crucial historical context against which the impact and outcomes of the new methodology (Centrelink data-driven) can be understood.</li>
<li>While it does not detail the planning, implementation, Indigenous involvement, or specific costs of the <em>new</em> methodology, it solidifies the understanding of the baseline from which the AEC began its improvements in Indigenous electoral participation estimation.</li>

ESTIMATES BRIEF - Hot Issue 
Additional Estimates – February 2019 

INDIGENOUS ENROLMENT RATE ESTIMATES 

Subject/Issue 

The Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) has prepared Indigenous enrolment 
rate estimates that show an overall increase on previous estimates. 

Key points 

 AEC Indigenous enrolment rate estimates, show an overall increase on

previous published data and shows that the Indigenous enrolment rate has
grown at a faster pace than that of the Roll as a whole.

 As at 30 June 2018 the AEC estimates that the national Indigenous enrolment

was 76.4 per cent.

 This new estimate based on more robust data reveals that the estimated

number of Indigenous Australians of voting age, who are enrolled continues
to rise.

 In the 12 months from 30 June 2017 to 30 June 2018 the AEC estimates there

has been:

o a 5.1 per cent increase in the estimated number of enrolled Indigenous
Australians as a proportion of the estimated Indigenous population,
rising from 364,631 to 383,078; and

o a corresponding 4 per cent fall in the estimated number of non-enrolled

Indigenous Australians from 123,517 to 118,581.

 In the same 12 month period the estimated Indigenous voting age population
only increased by 2.8 per cent (13,511 electors) from 488,148 to 501,659.

 Any gap between non-Indigenous and Indigenous enrolment rates is

disappointing, however it is encouraging to see that Indigenous enrolment
rates have improved considerably since the last time estimates were prepared.

 This new estimates will further inform the strategies that the AEC is

delivering to further increase electoral participation by Aboriginal and Torres
Strait Islander people.

Background  

Indigenous enrolment rate estimates 
  Previous Indigenous enrolment rate estimates of 58 per cent were based on the best 

information we had at the time. 

  These new figures are based on more recent and accurate data. Specifically, the AEC has 

been provided with self-identified Indigeneity data by the Department of Human Services, 
and with population data by the Australian Bureau of Statistics. 

  The AEC will be using this improved methodology from here on, and we’ll be updating 

the data every year as part of our annual roll-integrity review. 
 
Indigenous enrolment rate has grown at a faster pace than that of the Roll as a whole. 
  The table below shows the estimated Indigenous enrolment rates at 30 June 2017 and 

30 June 2018 by state and territory. A comparison column shows the rate of improvement 
across all states/territories and nationally.

96.2 per cent, which is 1.2 percentage points higher than on election day for the 2016 
federal election. 

  An estimated 95 per cent of the eligible population was enrolled to vote at the 2016

                    <p>This document is an "Estimates Brief" from February 2019, providing updated Indigenous enrolment rate estimates.</p>
<h3>Summary of Document</h3>
<p>The document, an "Estimates Brief" prepared for Additional Estimates in February 2019, details the Australian Electoral Commission's (AEC) updated methodology and findings regarding Indigenous electoral enrolment rates. Key points include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Increased Enrolment:</strong> The national Indigenous enrolment rate was estimated at 76.4% as of 30 June 2018, a significant increase from previous estimates of 58%. This indicates a faster growth rate for Indigenous enrolment compared to the overall electoral roll.</li>
<li><strong>New Methodology:</strong> The revised estimates are based on an "improved methodology" utilising more robust data, specifically self-identified Indigeneity data provided by the Department of Human Services (Centrelink) and population data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS). This new methodology will be updated annually.</li>
<li><strong>Positive Trends (2017-2018):</strong> Between 30 June 2017 and 30 June 2018, the estimated number of enrolled Indigenous Australians increased by 5.1% (from 364,631 to 383,078), while the estimated number of non-enrolled Indigenous Australians decreased by 4% (from 123,517 to 118,581).</li>
<li><strong>Strategic Use:</strong> The AEC states that these new estimates will inform future strategies aimed at further increasing electoral participation by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people.</li>
<li><strong>State-by-State Data:</strong> The document includes a table showing Indigenous enrolment rates for each state and territory as of June 2017 and June 2018, demonstrating a positive change across all jurisdictions.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Relevance to FOI Request LS7888</h3>
<p>This document is highly relevant to FOI request LS7888 as it directly addresses several core aspects:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>New Methodology:</strong> It explicitly details the "new methodology" for estimating Indigenous enrolment rates, confirming the shift from the 2014 methodology (58% estimate) and the utilisation of Centrelink's self-identified Indigeneity data, a key finding of the FOI request.</li>
<li><strong>Implementation &amp; Outcomes:</strong> The brief serves as a formal communication of the implementation of this new methodology and its immediate "outcomes," presenting the significantly increased estimated enrolment rate of 76.4% by June 2018, which aligns precisely with the figures highlighted in the FOI overview.</li>

Analysis of Indigenous Enrolment 

Population Estimates 

The ABS data provided at table 1 represents the ABS estimated resident Indigenous population 1=8 
years and over by state as at 2016 and projected to 30 June 2019. 

This data has not been adjusted by the ABS to calculate estimated Indigenous enrolment eligible 
population, however, table 2 provides the AEC’s estimated Indigenous voting age population as at 30 
June 2018.

As Australia’s federal electoral roll does not have a personal Indigenous identifier, estimating the 
enrolment rates for Indigenous persons is problematic, however, having this key franchise KPI for 
the Indigenous population is important for Closing the Gap purposes and the AECs focus on how the 
franchise could be better delivered. 

In 2014 the AEC’s Research Section commenced indirect estimation of these figures, using a 
regression model of the relationship between the Indigenous population and each of the three 
franchise KPIs at a small area level, such as polling place catchment or the ABS’ SA2 geography. 

While the models did not fit the data particularly well, the resulting Indigenous enrolment rates 
were statistically based on real data, rather than anecdote. Yet the resulting enrolment and turnout 
rates in particular were alarmingly low, and hopefully represented a worst case picture. 

As part of the Annual Roll Integrity Review (ARIR), the person-level matching between the Roll and 
Centrelink now includes Centrelink’s Indigenous indicator. However, as Centrelink customers 
represent only around half of the Roll, the matching (even if perfect) would be far from assigning all 
enrolments an Indigenous flag. Nevertheless, for the first time the AEC has a very large number of 
enrolled persons, over 6 million, with an explicit Indigenous status. 

The enrolment rate, even for all persons regardless of indigeneity, is difficult to calculate reliably due 
to conceptual, collection and methodological differences between the Roll (numerator) and the ABS-
based enrolment-eligible population (denominator, “EEP”). In the case of the Indigenous population

--- Page 3 ---

these problems are magnified by having no Indigenous identifier on the Roll and less reliable 
estimates of Indigenous EEP.  

However, matching the Roll to Centrelink data allows a more direct method of estimating the 
Indigenous enrolment rate. 

It is still subject to quite courageous assumptions, but as fewer are required it likely represents an 
improved approach. In summary: 

  For all Centrelink customers with an identified Indigenous or non-Indigenous status, 

calculate the proportion on the Roll. This is the raw enrolment rate of Centrelink clients. 
  Calculate the ratio of the actual AEC enrolment rate versus the Centrelink-based rate, for the 
same point in time. This is the overall factor to adjust any Centrelink-based rates to align 
with AEC enrolment rates. 

  Apply the adjustment factor to raw Centrelink-based enrolment rates by Indigenous status 

to give Indigenous and non-Indigenous enrolment rates. 

  This process can be done at the State level, though results will have lower reliability. 

It should be noted that while this method avoids indirectly modelling Indigenous enrolment rates via 
geographic association, it does assume that any bias in Centrelink clients being enrolled is equal for 
Indigenous and non-Indigenous, and that there are no substantive Indigenous-status biases inherent 
in the Roll-to-Centrelink person matching. 

The Centrelink client file with Indigenous indicator newly available to the AEC has presented an 
excellent opportunity, via matching to the Roll and mark-off data, to improve estimation of 
Indigenous franchise KPIs.  

While the results are subject to a number of non-trivial assumptions, the more direct estimation 
methods lead to a higher likelihood of robust results. The figures should nevertheless still be 
regarded as indicative only.

Centrelink Data 
The number of Indigenous Australians that are identified both on the Centrelink file sent to the AEC 
in July 2018 and the electoral Roll does not represent all Indigenous enrolments. It is limited to those 
Indigenous Australians who both receive a Centrelink benefit and who have self-identified as 
Indigenous to Centrelink. 

After considerable data cleansing and analysis the AEC identified 72,451 potentially unenrolled 
Indigenous Australians. This represents around 61 per cent of the 118,581 Indigenous Australians 
the AEC estimate were unenrolled as at 30 June 2018 (see table 2 above).  

The enrolment stimulation event conducted in February/March 2019 resulted in the enrolment of 
2,646 Indigenous Australians, reducing the estimated number of unenrolled Indigenous Australians 
identified in the Centrelink dataset to 69,143. Table 3 sets out the distribution of this cohort across 
electoral divisions.  

It is important to note that the potential unenrolled under 65 Indigenous Australians as at the 2019 
close of rolls represents those people that are on the Centrelink file sent to the AEC in July 2018 and 
who were included in the February 2019 enrolment stimulation event but had not enrolled as at the 
2019 close of rolls (18 April 2019).  

Analysis of the Centrelink potentially unenrolled Indigenous Australians 65 years and older identified 
significant matching error, due to the quality of data input and the nature of the residential status of 
this cohort. Work will be undertaken on the 2018-19 dataset to better understand this phenomenon 
to facilitate better targeting of potentially unenrolled indigenous Australians in the future.

                    <p>This document, titled "Analysis of Indigenous Enrolment Population Estimates," details the Australian Electoral Commission's (AEC) updated methodology for estimating Indigenous electoral enrolment rates and its initial outcomes.</p>
<p><strong>Summary of Document Content:</strong></p>
<p>The document outlines the AEC's shift from an indirect, statistically-based regression model (used in 2014, which yielded "alarmingly low" enrolment rates) to a "more direct method" for estimating Indigenous enrolment. This new methodology leverages self-identified Indigeneity data from Centrelink, matched against the electoral roll.</p>
<p>Key information provided includes:<br />
*   <strong>Estimated Indigenous Enrolment Rate:</strong> As at 30 June 2018, the estimated national Indigenous enrolment rate using this new methodology was <strong>76.4%</strong>.<br />
*   <strong>Methodological Details:</strong> The document explains the process of using Centrelink data, involving calculating raw enrolment rates for Centrelink clients (both Indigenous and non-Indigenous), applying an adjustment factor derived from the overall AEC enrolment rate, and then applying this factor to Indigenous and non-Indigenous Centrelink-based rates. It acknowledges that the method involves "courageous assumptions" and potential biases, yet is considered an "improved approach."<br />
*   <strong>Identification of Unenrolled:</strong> Through the Centrelink data matching, the AEC identified <strong>72,451 potentially unenrolled Indigenous Australians</strong> as of mid-2018 (representing approximately 61% of the total estimated unenrolled Indigenous population at that time).<br />
*   <strong>Enrolment Stimulation Outcomes:</strong> A subsequent enrolment stimulation event in February/March 2019 resulted in the enrolment of <strong>2,646 Indigenous Australians</strong>, reducing the identified potentially unenrolled cohort to <strong>69,143</strong>.<br />
*   <strong>Data Granularity:</strong> The document includes detailed tables (Table 3 and 4) providing a breakdown of potentially unenrolled Indigenous Australians (under 65) and Indigenous Australians identified on the Centrelink file who were enrolled, presented by electoral division and state as at the 2019 close of rolls.<br />
*   <strong>Limitations:</strong> It notes difficulties in calculating reliable enrolment rates due to the lack of an Indigenous identifier on the Roll and less reliable Indigenous population estimates, and specifically highlights issues with data matching for Indigenous Australians aged 65 and over.</p>
<p><strong>Relevance to FOI Request LS7888:</strong></p>
<p>This document is highly relevant to FOI request LS7888, which sought information on the AEC's new methodology for its Indigenous Electoral Participation Program (IEPP), particularly concerning its planning, implementation, and outcomes.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>New Methodology (Planning &amp; Implementation):</strong> The document directly addresses the "new methodology" by detailing the strategic shift from the previous regression model to the Centrelink data-matching approach. It explains the core mechanics, assumptions, and improvements of this updated method, illustrating its "planning" (conceptual shift) and "implementation" (how the data is processed).</li>
<li><strong>Outcomes:</strong> It provides a key quantitative outcome of the new methodology: the significantly increased estimated Indigenous enrolment rate (76.4% by June 2018). It also details a direct outcome of leveraging this new data: the identification of a large cohort of potentially unenrolled Indigenous Australians and the results of a subsequent enrolment stimulation event (2,646 new enrolments), directly addressing the "outcomes" aspect of the FOI.</li>
<li><strong>Indigenous Involvement/Costs/Staffing:</strong> Consistent with the FOI overview, the document does not explicitly detail the number of Indigenous people involved in the methodology's development or its final costs and dedicated AEC staffing.</li>

Hi Robyn 

The work you and your team are continuing to do on the analysis of indigenous enrolment is excellent and 
extremely valuable. As you can see from our discussion with the Assistant Minister on Thursday last week, this data 
is extremely important (and as you know we already have a request from the Finance Minister’s Office for this data). 

I would like to provide both Minister’s this data within the next 2‐3 business days but before doing so I think we 
need to do a couple of things with the documents produced: 

‐ 

‐ 

‐ 

Firstly, and most critically, at the start of the document we need to outline the methodology used but in 
particular we need to emphasise that this data is based on estimates on top of estimates so they clearly 
understand that this data is not and cannot be considered 100% accurate. This document will need to be a 
stand alone document if we are going to provide it into the Office’s and whilst I can verbally convey the 
caveats I don’t want those to be lost over time so can we please embed a paragraph or two at the top of the 
document that provides that critical context (a fair bit of which you have in your email below). 
I think table 3 should precede table 2 because table 3 looks like the high level summary of table 2 and I think 
we need a few sentences that outlines the differences between the high level data in table 1 and the high 
level data in table 3 (which I am proposing becomes table 2) – which you also have in your email below. 
I also note there is a slight discrepancy in the numbers of unenrolled in tables 2 and 3 – of about 700 
electors. We will need to reconcile that or explain it as that will be quickly picked up by the advisors. 

Grateful for an updated draft of the document by cob tomorrow please so I can look at providing to the Minister’s 
Offices. 

Regards

Hi Jeff 

In the attachment we have provided: 

  Table 1 ‐ our published estimated Indigenous Enrolment rates based on self‐identified Indigenous people on 

Centrelink data as compared to the Roll and taken as a percentage of estimated Indigenous eligible 
population  

  Table 2 – the Divisional breakdown of the 72K or so Indigenous people identified from that original 

Centrelink data who were contacted as part of the Feb stimulation event (data was cleansed to remove over 
65s and to removed those who we thought were on the roll – minimising mis‐matches) and excludes those 
who enrolled before the federal election (ie. those identified as unenrolled). It also details the number of 
people that we were able to match from the Centrelink data (those identified as enrolled).  

  Table 3 ‐ the same data as above by State. 
  Table 4 ‐ ABS estimated Indigenous population, over 18yo – not eligible population. This is not available 

broken down any further. 

I preface all of it by saying that only Table 1 and the ABS data at Table 4 are published externally. While there are 
multiple caveats due the nature of the data it certainly gives us much to work on. Aside from the ABS data, the rest 
is all based on June 18 so getting older now (although not irrelevant) and we are working on the new data sets now. 

We have done some internal breakdowns for IEPP officers but we wouldn’t feel comfortable sharing this as the 
further we break it down, the greater risk of error. They remain indicative and we have had to make some 
assumptions from the data. 

As I mentioned in my previous email we are working through the latest June 2019 Centrelink data with BIREI at the 
moment and as this will be our second time around, hope to have increasing confidence in our estimates, albeit still 
limited by some of the quality issues with their data.

Can you please advise how long it will take for us to pull together our data estimates to respond to the 
questions below from the Minister’s Office. I am assuming we have something close to ready (noting our 
data limitations on this issue) as part of our preparation for the Assistant Minister’s visit on Thursday. I 
would like to get something to Daniel within the next 48 hours.

Hi Jeff 

Could I please get some statistics on Indigenous population distributions, insofar as this data is held by the AEC? 

For instance Indigenous enrolment by electorate, and/or Indigenous enrolment by suburb/ town? 

I also wonder what data we have on under‐enrolment of Indigenous Australians by location? For instance the AEC 
certainly has the ABS estimate of the Census undercount in the NT, but I wonder if there is similar data for other 
locations. 

Thanks

                    <h3>Document Summary</h3>
<p>This document is an email chain from August 2019 among senior Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) staff, including the Deputy Electoral Commissioner, Assistant Commissioner, and directors/assistant directors of the Roll Management &amp; Community Engagement Branch. The correspondence centers on the preparation and refinement of an "Indigenous data" report ("Indigenous population statistics") for presentation to Australian Government Ministers (Assistant Minister, Finance Minister).</p>
<p>Key points from the document include:<br />
*   <strong>Data Content:</strong> The report compiles various Indigenous electoral statistics, including:<br />
    *   Published estimated Indigenous enrolment rates based on self-identified Indigenous people from Centrelink data compared to the Electoral Roll (Table 1).<br />
    *   Divisional and state breakdowns of approximately 72,000 Indigenous people identified from Centrelink data (June 2018) who were contacted as part of a "Feb stimulation event" (Tables 2 &amp; 3). This data was cleansed to remove certain groups (e.g., over 65s, those already on the roll).<br />
    *   Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) estimated Indigenous population (over 18 years old) (Table 4).<br />
*   <strong>Methodology and Caveats:</strong> Senior staff emphasize the need to explicitly state the methodology used and stress that the data is "based on estimates on top of estimates" and "cannot be considered 100% accurate" due to the nature and quality of the underlying data (Centrelink data quality issues, further breakdown leading to greater error risk).<br />
*   <strong>Ministerial Interest:</strong> There is high-level ministerial interest in this data, with requests from both the Assistant Minister and the Finance Minister's Office.<br />
*   <strong>Ongoing Work:</strong> The AEC was actively working on incorporating the latest June 2019 Centrelink data with their Business Intelligence, Research and Electoral Integrity (BIREI) unit to increase confidence in their estimates.</p>
<h3>Relevance to FOI Request LS7888</h3>
<p>This document is highly relevant to FOI request LS7888 as it provides direct insight into the AEC's new methodology for its Indigenous Electoral Participation Program (IEPP) and associated data.<br />
*   <strong>New Methodology &amp; Data Use:</strong> The document explicitly confirms the AEC's reliance on "self-identified Indigenous people on Centrelink data" to estimate Indigenous enrolment rates and identify potentially unenrolled Indigenous Australians. This directly aligns with the FOI request's overview stating the AEC's transition to a more direct method using Centrelink data.<br />
*   <strong>Implementation &amp; Outcomes:</strong> The discussion of the "Feb stimulation event" where ~72,000 Indigenous people were identified and contacted for enrolment stimulation demonstrates a concrete implementation activity and its associated outcomes (e.g., numbers identified). The document details how the outcomes of the new methodology (estimated enrolment rates, figures of unenrolled Indigenous Australians) are being tracked and communicated internally and to ministers.<br />
*   <strong>Planning &amp; Refinement:</strong> The email chain illustrates the internal planning and refinement process for communicating the results of the new methodology, including the critical discussion around presenting the data with appropriate caveats regarding its estimation basis.<br />
*   <strong>Consistency with FOI Findings:</strong> The mention of "over 72,000 potentially unenrolled Indigenous Australians" in mid-2018 (or identified from June 2018 data) directly supports and adds detail to the FOI overview's finding about identifying such a group.<br />
*   <strong>Gaps in FOI Request:</strong> The document, consistent with the FOI request's noted gaps, does not explicitly detail the number of Indigenous people involved in the methodology's development or its final costs and dedicated AEC staffing.</p>

Indigenous enrolment rate estimates 

As Australia’s federal electoral roll does not have a personal Indigenous identifier, estimating the 
enrolment rates for Indigenous persons is problematic, however, having this key franchise KPI for 
the Indigenous population is important for Closing the Gap purposes and the AECs focus on how 
the franchise could be better delivered. 

In 2014 the AEC’s Research Section commenced indirect estimation of these figures, using a 
regression model of the relationship between the Indigenous population and each of the three 
franchise KPIs at a small area level, such as polling place catchment or the ABS’ SA2 geography.

While the models did not fit the data particularly well, the resulting Indigenous enrolment rates 
were statistically based on real data, rather than anecdote. Yet the resulting enrolment and turnout 
rates in particular were alarmingly low, and hopefully represented a worst case picture. 

Current method 

The Centrelink client file with Indigenous indicator available to the AEC annually since 2017 has 
presented an excellent opportunity, via matching to the Roll and mark-off data, to improve 
estimation of Indigenous franchise KPIs.  

While the results are subject to a number of non-trivial assumptions, the more direct estimation 
methods lead to a higher likelihood of robust results. The figures should nevertheless still be 
regarded as indicative only. 

As part of the Annual Roll Integrity Review (ARIR), the person-level matching between the Roll and 
Centrelink now includes Centrelink’s Indigenous indicator. However, as Centrelink customers 
represent only around half of the Roll, the matching (even if perfect) would be far from assigning all 
enrolments an Indigenous flag. Nevertheless, for the first time the AEC has a very large number of 
enrolled persons, over 6 million, matched to Centrelink records with an explicit Indigenous status. 

The enrolment rate, even for all persons regardless of indigeneity, is difficult to calculate reliably 
due to conceptual, collection and methodological differences between the Roll (numerator) and the 
ABS-based enrolment-eligible population (denominator, “EEP”). In the case of the Indigenous 
population these problems are magnified by having no Indigenous identifier on the Roll and less 
reliable estimates of Indigenous EEP.  

However, matching the Roll to Centrelink data allows a more direct method of estimating the 
Indigenous enrolment rate. Results for 30 June 2018 are provided in Table 2.

It is still subject to quite courageous assumptions, but as fewer are required it likely represents an 
improved approach. In summary: 

  For all Centrelink customers with an identified Indigenous or non-Indigenous status, 

calculate the proportion on the Roll. This is the raw enrolment rate of Centrelink clients. 
  Calculate the ratio of the actual AEC enrolment rate versus the Centrelink-based rate, for 
the same point in time. This is the overall factor to adjust any Centrelink-based rates to 
align with AEC enrolment rates. 

  Apply the adjustment factor to raw Centrelink-based enrolment rates by Indigenous status 

to give Indigenous and non-Indigenous enrolment rates.

  This process can be done at the State level, though results will have lower reliability. 

It should be noted that while this method avoids indirectly modelling Indigenous enrolment rates via 
geographic association, it does assume that any bias in Centrelink clients being enrolled is equal 
for Indigenous and non-Indigenous, and that there are no substantive Indigenous-status biases 
inherent in the Roll-to-Centrelink person matching. 

Centrelink data 

The number of Indigenous Australians that are identified both on the Centrelink file sent to the AEC 
in July 2018 and the electoral Roll does not represent all Indigenous enrolments. It is limited to 
those Indigenous Australians who both receive a Centrelink benefit and who have self-identified as 
Indigenous to Centrelink. 

After considerable data cleansing and analysis the AEC identified 72,451 potentially unenrolled 
Indigenous Australians. This represents around 61 per cent of the 118,581 Indigenous Australians 
the AEC estimate were not enrolled as at 30 June 2018 (see Table 2 above). 

The enrolment stimulation event conducted in February/March 2019 using 2018 Centrelink data 
resulted in the enrolment of 2,646 people who indicated they were Indigenous. This reduced the 
estimated number of unenrolled Indigenous Australians identified in the Centrelink dataset to 
69,143. Table 3 sets out the distribution of this cohort across states and Table 4 provides the data 
for electoral divisions. 

It is important to note that the potential unenrolled under 65 Indigenous Australians as at the 2019 
close of rolls represents those people that are on the Centrelink file sent to the AEC in July 2018 
and who were included in the February 2019 enrolment stimulation event but had not enrolled as at 
the 2019 close of rolls (18 April 2019). 

Analysis of the Centrelink potentially unenrolled Indigenous Australians 65 years and older 
identified significant matching error, due to the quality of data input and the nature of the residential 
status of this cohort. Work will be undertaken on the 2019 dataset to better understand this 
phenomenon to facilitate better targeting of potentially unenrolled indigenous Australians in the 
future.

                    <p>This document, titled "Analysis of Indigenous Enrolment," details the Australian Electoral Commission's (AEC) updated methodology for estimating Indigenous electoral enrolment rates.</p>
<p><strong>Summary of Document:</strong><br />
The document outlines the AEC's shift from an indirect, statistically-based regression model (used in 2014, yielding "alarmingly low" rates) to a more direct estimation method. This new approach, implemented since 2017, leverages Centrelink client files that include a self-identified Indigenous indicator. By matching these Centrelink records to the electoral roll, the AEC can more accurately estimate Indigenous enrolment rates.</p>
<p>Key findings and details presented:<br />
*   <strong>New Methodology:</strong> The AEC's "current method" involves person-level matching between the electoral roll and Centrelink data, including Centrelink's Indigenous indicator. An adjustment factor is applied to raw Centrelink-based enrolment rates to align them with overall AEC enrolment rates.<br />
*   <strong>Estimated Enrolment Rates:</strong> As of 30 June 2018, the estimated national Indigenous enrolment rate using this new methodology was <strong>76.4%</strong>. State-level breakdowns are also provided.<br />
*   <strong>Enrolment Stimulation:</strong> Through data cleansing and analysis of the Centrelink file, the AEC identified <strong>72,451 potentially unenrolled Indigenous Australians</strong> (under 65) as of mid-2018.<br />
*   <strong>Outcomes of Stimulation:</strong> An enrolment stimulation event conducted in February/March 2019, using the 2018 Centrelink data, resulted in the enrolment of <strong>2,646 individuals</strong> who indicated they were Indigenous. This reduced the identified unenrolled cohort to 69,143.<br />
*   <strong>Data Limitations:</strong> The document acknowledges that Centrelink data represents only about half of the total electoral roll and is limited to Indigenous Australians receiving Centrelink benefits who have self-identified. It also notes issues with matching data for Indigenous Australians aged 65 and over.<br />
*   <strong>Detailed Breakdown:</strong> Tables provide granular data on enrolled and potentially unenrolled Indigenous Australians by state and electoral division.</p>
<p><strong>Relevance to FOI Request LS7888:</strong><br />
This document is highly relevant to FOI request LS7888 as it directly addresses:<br />
*   <strong>New Methodology:</strong> It provides comprehensive details on the AEC's new methodology for its Indigenous Electoral Participation Program (IEPP), specifically its reliance on Centrelink's self-identified Indigenous data.<br />
*   <strong>Planning and Implementation:</strong> It describes the transition from the old method, the integration of Centrelink data into the Annual Roll Integrity Review (ARIR), and the execution of the enrolment stimulation event.<br />
*   <strong>Outcomes:</strong> It presents key outcomes such as the increased estimated Indigenous enrolment rate (76.4% by June 2018), the identification of potentially unenrolled Indigenous Australians, and the number of new enrolments resulting from the stimulation event.</p>
<p>Consistent with the FOI overview, the document does not explicitly detail the number of Indigenous people involved in the methodology's development or its final costs and dedicated AEC staffing. However, it significantly clarifies the technical planning, implementation, and initial outcomes of the new IEPP methodology.</p>

Indigenous Franchise KPIs using Centrelink data 

Background 
As Australia’s federal electoral roll does not have a personal Indigenous identifier, estimating the enrolment, 
 rates for Indigenous persons is problematic. Having these key franchise KPIs for the 

Indigenous population is important for Closing the Gap purposes and the AECs focus on how the franchise 
could be better delivered. 

In 2014 the AEC’s Research Section commenced indirect estimation of these figures, using a regression model 
of the relationship between the Indigenous population and each of the three franchise KPIs at a small area 
level, such as polling place catchment or the ABS’ SA2 geography. While the models did not fit the data 
particularly well, the resulting Indigenous enrolment, 
real data, rather than anecdote. Yet the resulting enrolment and turnout rates in particular were alarmingly 
low, and hopefully represented a worst case picture. 

 rates were statistically based on 

Centrelink Data 
Around the same time, the Research Section informally proposed that person-level Centrelink extracts that the 
AEC received occasionally for other Roll validation work, could perhaps be extended to include Centrelink’s 
Indigenous indicator. This came to fruition in 20171. 

As part of the Annual Roll Integrity Review (ARIR), the person-level matching between the Roll and Centrelink 
now included Centrelink’s Indigenous indicator. However as Centrelink customers represent only around half 
of the Roll, the matching (even if perfect) would be far from assigning all enrolments an Indigenous flag. 
Nevertheless, for the first time the AEC has a very large number of enrolled persons, over 6 million, with an 
explicit Indigenous status. 

Enrolment Rate

1.
The enrolment rate, even for all persons regardless of indigeneity, is difficult to calculate reliably due to 
conceptual, collection and methodological differences between the Roll (numerator) and the ABS-based 
enrolment-eligible population (denominator, “EEP”). In the case of the Indigenous population these problems 
are magnified by having no Indigenous identifier on the Roll and less reliable estimates of Indigenous EEP.  

However, matching the Roll to Centrelink data allows a more direct method of estimating the Indigenous 
enrolment rate. It is still subject to quite courageous assumptions, but as fewer are required it likely 
represents an improved approach. In summary: 









For all Centrelink customers with an identified Indigenous or non-Indigenous status, calculate the
proportion on the Roll. This is the raw enrolment rate of Centrelink clients.
Calculate the ratio of the actual AEC enrolment rate versus the Centrelink-based rate, for the same
point in time. This is the overall factor to adjust any Centrelink-based rates to align with AEC
enrolment rates.
Apply the adjustment factor to raw Centrelink-based enrolment rates by Indigenous status to give
Indigenous and non-Indigenous enrolment rates.
This process can be done at the State level, though results will have lower reliability.

NOTE: While this method avoids indirectly modelling Indigenous enrolment rates via geographic 
association, it does assume that any bias in Centrelink clients being enrolled is equal for 
Indigenous and non-Indigenous, and that there are no substantive Indigenous-status biases 
inherent in the Roll-to-Centrelink person matching.

Conclusion and Results 
The Centrelink client file with Indigenous indicator newly available to the AEC has presented an excellent 
opportunity, via matching to the Roll and mark-off data, to improve estimation of Indigenous franchise KPIs.  

While the results are subject to a number of non-trivial assumptions, the more direct estimation methods lead 
to a higher likelihood of robust results. The figures should nevertheless still be regarded as indicative only.

                    <p>This document, titled "Indigenous Franchise KPIs using Centrelink data," details the Australian Electoral Commission's (AEC) updated methodology for estimating Indigenous electoral enrolment rates. It highlights the challenge of tracking Indigenous enrolment due to the absence of a specific identifier on the electoral roll.</p>
<p>The document explains the transition from an "indirect estimation" method (a regression model from 2014 that yielded "alarmingly low" and unreliable rates) to a "more direct method" developed in 2017. This new approach leverages person-level Centrelink data, specifically the Indigenous indicator included in Centrelink extracts. Although Centrelink data covers only about half of the electoral roll, it allows the AEC to directly associate Indigenous status with over 6 million enrolled persons for the first time.</p>
<p>The new methodology for calculating the Indigenous enrolment rate involves:<br />
1.  Calculating the raw enrolment rate for Centrelink clients (Indigenous and non-Indigenous) who are on the electoral roll.<br />
2.  Deriving an overall adjustment factor by comparing the actual AEC enrolment rate for all persons with the Centrelink-based rate.<br />
3.  Applying this adjustment factor to the raw Centrelink-based Indigenous and non-Indigenous enrolment rates to produce adjusted, indicative estimates.</p>
<p>While acknowledging that the results are based on "courageous assumptions" and should be considered "indicative only," the document concludes that this Centrelink-based method offers a "higher likelihood of robust results" compared to the previous model. The work of the former Electoral Integrity Unit and IT Branch is acknowledged for their contributions.</p>
<p><strong>Relevance to FOI Request LS7888:</strong></p>
<p>This document is highly relevant to FOI request LS7888 as it directly addresses the AEC's new methodology for its Indigenous Electoral Participation Program (IEPP) and provides insights into its development and impact.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>New Methodology:</strong> It comprehensively describes the "new methodology" for estimating Indigenous electoral enrolment rates, central to the FOI request, detailing the shift from indirect modelling to the direct use of Centrelink data.</li>
<li><strong>Planning &amp; Implementation:</strong> The document outlines the genesis of the new approach (an "informal proposal" by the Research Section) and its "fruition in 2017" as part of the Annual Roll Integrity Review (ARIR), addressing the planning and implementation aspects.</li>
<li><strong>Outcomes:</strong> While not providing specific enrolment rate percentages, the document details the methodological improvement that led to the "significantly increased estimated Indigenous enrolment rates" noted in the FOI overview, moving away from "alarmingly low" figures to more "robust" (albeit indicative) results.</li>
<li><strong>Indigenous Involvement &amp; Costs:</strong> Consistent with the FOI overview, this document <em>does not</em> explicitly detail the number of Indigenous people involved in the methodology's development nor does it provide information on the final costs or dedicated AEC staffing for this initiative.</li>

RE: Indigenous enrolment rates [SEC=UNCLASSIFIED]

The estimated enrolled NSW Indigenous rate decreased only 1 percentage point from 87% in 2018 to 86% in 2019. 
This decrease is not statistically significant and falls within an estimation error for these calculations (being this 
difference actually marginal).  

This 1 percentage point difference represents in absolute numbers an increase of the estimated unenrolled NSW 
Indigenous population of 2,285 Indigenous (from 20,954 to 23,239) which then represents an increase of 10.9 per 
cent in unenrolled Indigenous when compared to previous year. However, note that this apparent b g increase is 
because the state size (the biggest in the country in relation to enrolment eligible population) where a decrease in 1 
percentage point in enrolled indigenous then represents a big number in relation to the total estimated unenrolled 
indigenous. For example, if the estimated enrolled QLD indigenous population decreased 1 percentage point too 
from 73% in 2018 to 72% in 2019 (instead of the observed 1 percentage point increase in this period) then this 
decrease will represent a 6.3 per cent increase (2,362) of the estimated unenrolled QLD Indigenous population from 
37,285 to 39,647 Indigenous. In this example, the increase (6.3 per cent) in QLD  s lower than the actual increase 
observed in NSW (10.9 per cent) because the total estimated unenrolled Indigenous population in QLD (37,285 in 
2018) is larger than that estimate in NSW (20,954 in 2018) – NSW has the largest estimated enrolled Indigenous rate 
in the Country at 86 per cent compared to QLD at only 74 per cent.

Guy, 

How did the non‐enrolled Indigenous population in NSW increase by 11%? 

That seems to be the only real outlier to me. In most cases it stayed pretty much the same. I think we will need to be 
prepared to answer the question about NSW. 

Thanks.

There was a small increase nationally from 76.4 per cent to 76.6 per cent, not really significant but better
than a reduction. This continues the upward trend over the last few years with  he 2017 rate at 74.7 per
cent.
The estimated Indigenous eligible enrolment population (EEP) grew by 13,360 people (or 2.7 per cent) while
the estimated number of Indigenous people enrolled grew by 11,455 (3 per cent)
The estimated unenrolled Indigenous population grew from 118,581 to 120,486 (1.6 per cent increase). This
compares unfavourably with the change between 2017 and 2018 where the estimated unenrolled
Indigenous population fell from 123,517 to 118,581 (4 per cent decrease).

There was a decrease in NSW from 87.3 per cent to 86.2 per cent. While falling over the last two years the
rate is up from the 2017 rate of 85.9 per cent.
The estimated Indigenous EEP for NSW grew by 4,051 people (2.5 per cent) while the estimated number of
Indigenous people enrolled in the NSW grew by 1,766 (1.2 per cent)
The estimated unenrolled NSW Indigenous population grew from 20,954 to 23,239 (10.9 per cent increase).
This compares unfavourably with the change between 2017 and 2018 where the estimated unenrolled
Indigenous population fell from 22,605 to 20,954 (7.3 per cent decrease).

There was a small increase in the NT from 67.5 per cent to 68.2 per cent. This continues the upward trend
over the last few years with the 2017 rate at 67.1 per cent.
The estimated Indigenous EEP for NT grew by 1,111 people (or 2.2 per cent) while the estimated number of
Indigenous people enrolled in the NT grew by 1,132 (3.3 per cent)
The estimated unenrolled NT Indigenous population fell from 16,433 to 16,412 (0.1 per cent decrease). This
compares favourably with the change between 2017 and 2018 where the estimated unenrolled Indigenous
population grew from 16,275 to 16,433 (1 per cent increase).

There was a small increase in the WA from 63.8 per cent to 65 per cent. This continues the upward trend
over the last few years with the 2017 rate at 62.8 per cent.
The estimated Indigenous EEP for WA grew by 1,790 people (or 2.8 per cent) while the estimated number of
Indigenous people enrolled in WA grew by 1,905 (4.6 per cent)
The estimated unenrolled WA Indigenous population fell from 23,363 to 23,248 (0.1 per cent decrease). This

                    <h2>Document Summary</h2>
<p>This document is an internal email exchange within the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) from September 2019, discussing the latest Indigenous electoral enrolment rates for 2019, with comparisons to 2018 and 2017. Key points include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>National Trends:</strong> The national Indigenous enrolment rate saw a small increase from 76.4% in 2018 to 76.6% in 2019, continuing an upward trend from 74.7% in 2017. While the estimated number of enrolled Indigenous people grew by 3%, the estimated unenrolled Indigenous population also increased by 1.6% (from 118,581 to 120,486), which was noted as "unfavourable" compared to the previous year's decrease.</li>
<li><strong>State-level Analysis:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>NSW:</strong> Experienced a slight decrease in its Indigenous enrolment rate from 87.3% (2018) to 86.2% (2019). Despite this small percentage drop, the estimated unenrolled NSW Indigenous population significantly increased by 10.9% (from 20,954 to 23,239), due to the large overall eligible population in the state. This increase in unenrolled numbers was a point of internal discussion, noting the need to be prepared to explain it.</li>
<li><strong>NT, WA, QLD:</strong> All showed small increases in their Indigenous enrolment rates, continuing upward trends from 2017. The NT and WA saw marginal decreases in their estimated unenrolled Indigenous populations. (Detailed QLD unenrolled figures are not fully present in the provided snippet but are implied in the discussion).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Internal Discussion:</strong> The emails show AEC staff analyzing the data, particularly the "outlier" trend in NSW, and preparing documentation (minutes, speaking notes, QTB) for reporting on these figures.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Relevance to FOI Request LS7888</h2>
<p>This document is highly relevant to FOI request LS7888, which sought information on the AEC's new Indigenous Electoral Participation Program (IEPP) methodology, specifically its planning, implementation, and outcomes for 2018-2019.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Outcomes:</strong> The document directly addresses the "outcomes" aspect of the FOI request by providing precise Indigenous enrolment rates and detailed statistics on enrolled and unenrolled populations for 2018 and 2019, both nationally and for key states (NSW, NT, WA, QLD). These figures corroborate the overall national rate increases cited in the FOI request overview (76.4% by June 2018 and 76.6% by June 2019), demonstrating the tangible results of the new methodology.</li>
<li><strong>Implementation/Impact:</strong> By presenting the actual enrolment rates derived from the AEC's ongoing data collection (presumably using the Centrelink data-driven methodology), the document illustrates the impact and ongoing implementation of the new approach during the specified timeframe.</li>
<li><strong>Planning:</strong> The email exchange demonstrates internal AEC analysis and "paper work" preparation related to reporting on these outcomes, indicating ongoing planning and management of the IEPP and its metrics.</li>
<li><strong>Limitations:</strong> Consistent with the FOI overview, the document does not explicitly detail the number of Indigenous people involved in the methodology's development or its final costs and dedicated AEC staffing.</li>

RE: Indigenous KPI [DLM=For-Official-Use-Only]

Yeah, good pick‐up by Gus. Thanks Gus. 
The revised numbers are now available and Gus is happy with the numbers. Angelo, when you’re free please come over so we can discuss.  

I created a file to note the number of records T:\Operations\BIREI\BI_SAS\04_ttabije\data\Number of records.xlsx from the input files to output datasets, for checking.

Note that we just noticed that the comparison between 2019 and 2018 looks strange and we just fixed this.

Hi All, 

Below are the results for 30 June 2019 ATSI enrolment rates for your review for endorsement to RMCE. 
Angelo and I have looked at these figures and are both happy with the results. 

If you want to see the working file, please see . T:\Strategic Capability\Strategic Research &amp; Analysis\Research\Polling Places\IEPP &amp; other requests\KPIs\Using 2016 Census Data &amp; Methods\ARIR‐Centrelink\Indigenous Enrolment Rate 2019 
BENCHMARKED.xlsb 

Angelo, as discussed, the only thing we need to check and make sure that is current is the below file. I will have a 
look and see if I can find a SAS program that outputs &#34;Informality modelling.xlsb&#34; next week. Note that any 
change in this file will have no effect on the results below.

                    <h3>Summary of Document LS7888 Released Document No. 377</h3>
<p>This document consists of an email exchange from late August to early September 2019 between various AEC staff members (Tita Tabije, Angelo Rojas, Gus Verzosa, Guy Lewis, Andrew Trainer, Sean Ferrari, Sam Hannan-Morrow) from the Business Intelligence, Research &amp; Electoral Integrity (BIREI) and Roll Management &amp; Community Engagement (RMCE) sections. The correspondence centers on the review and finalisation of "Indigenous KPI" results, specifically the estimated Indigenous electoral enrolment rates for 30 June 2019.</p>
<p>The emails reveal an internal process of data validation and refinement, including the identification and correction of an issue that made the comparison between 2018 and 2019 numbers appear "strange." Staff confirm that the revised figures are satisfactory and ready for endorsement by the Executive Leadership Team (ELT). A key detail is the reference to a working file path, <code>T:\Strategic Capability\Strategic Research &amp; Analysis\Research\Polling Places\IEPP &amp; other requests\KPIs\Using 2016 Census Data &amp; Methods\ARIR-Centrelink\Indigenous Enrolment Rate 2019 BENCHMARKED.xlsb</code>, which explicitly links the calculations to the Indigenous Electoral Participation Program (IEPP) and indicates the use of Centrelink data (<code>ARIR-Centrelink</code>) in conjunction with 2016 Census data for Key Performance Indicators (KPIs).</p>
<p>The document includes two tables presenting the finalised data:<br />
1.  <strong>Indigenous Status Enrolment Rates, 30 June 2019:</strong> This table provides detailed figures by state and nationally for both Indigenous and Non-Indigenous populations. Key national figures for Indigenous Australians are:<br />
    *   Estimated voting age population: 515,019<br />
    *   Estimated enrolled: 391,418<br />
    *   Estimated 'missing' (unenrolled): 123,601<br />
    *   Enrolment Rate: 76%<br />
2.  <strong>Differences between 30 June 2019 and 30 June 2018:</strong> This table shows the changes in estimated populations, enrolments, and enrolment rates over the preceding year. Nationally, the estimated 'missing' Indigenous population decreased by 5,020 between June 2018 and June 2019.</p>
<h3>Relevance to FOI Request LS7888</h3>
<p>This document is highly relevant to FOI request LS7888, which sought information on the AEC's new methodology for its Indigenous Electoral Participation Program (IEPP) concerning its planning, implementation, and outcomes during 2018-2019:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>New Methodology (Implementation &amp; Refinement):</strong> The email exchange and the referenced file path clearly demonstrate the ongoing implementation and internal review of the new methodology for calculating Indigenous enrolment rates. The explicit mention of <code>ARIR-Centrelink</code> data and <code>2016 Census Data &amp; Methods</code> directly confirms the application of the Centrelink-based approach for IEPP KPIs. The discussion about addressing data discrepancies between 2018 and 2019 highlights the meticulous refinement efforts within the methodology.</li>
<li><strong>Outcomes:</strong> The attached tables provide concrete outcomes of the new methodology. Specifically, they present the national estimated Indigenous enrolment rate of 76% as of June 2019, which closely aligns with the FOI overview's stated outcome (76.6% for June 2019). The document also details the estimated number of unenrolled Indigenous Australians ("the missing") as 123,601 for June 2019 and indicates a reduction of 5,020 in this figure compared to June 2018, implying positive progress in enrolment efforts or data accuracy.</li>
<li><strong>Timeline:</strong> The document's dates (late August to early September 2019) and the data it presents (as of 30 June 2019) fall squarely within the 2018-2019 timeframe specified by the FOI request.</li>
</ul>
<p>While highly relevant to the methodology's implementation and outcomes, the document does not explicitly detail the number of Indigenous people involved in the methodology's development or its final costs and dedicated AEC staffing, as noted as gaps in the FOI overview.</p>

Subject: FW: Indigenous data [SEC=UNCLASSIFIED] 

Guy - as discussed, the number of new enrolments for Indigenous not on the roll could be predicted to a fair extent by the proportion of Email/SMSs 
provided by State. Further analysis of this shows that the strong correlation is for people aged 18-39. 

The proportion of people aged 18-39 in NT, WA and SA who provided Email/SMS is low and so is their proportion of new enrolments. This analysis will be 
more direct when Mike provides me with the extract that includes Email and/or SMS sent to confirm two hypothesis: 

1. We are sending less Email/SMS to these states.
2. Additionally, enrolment response rates are also lower for these states than for the rest (higher level of disengagement).

Thanks Guy – this data is very interesting. 
I suspect we may have to do something additional/special with the BDM data to establish eligibility prior to being able to do any meaningful 
direct enrolment effort.

                    <p>This document, dated March-June 2018, consists of internal emails between Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) staff (Angelo Rojas, Guy Lewis, Warrick Poyser, Michael Roden, Stephanie Maxwell, Delyse Paliaga, Gina Dario) concerning data analysis for Indigenous electoral enrolment.</p>
<p><strong>Summary of Document Content:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Centrelink Data Utilisation:</strong> The document prominently features the AEC's use of Centrelink data to identify potentially unenrolled Indigenous Australians. Specifically, an email from Guy Lewis (March 2018) details an age breakdown of "107,607 Indigenous people that are only on the Centrelink file," noting that 30.7% (33,008) are in the 18-24 age group.</li>
<li><strong>Data Refinement and Eligibility:</strong> Discussions include the need to cross-reference this Centrelink data with other sources (e.g., Births, Deaths, and Marriages (BDM) data, deceased persons files, and deleted records) to establish eligibility and remove those who are deceased or previously enrolled, prior to any direct enrolment efforts.</li>
<li><strong>Enrolment Stimulation and Outreach Analysis:</strong> An email from Angelo Rojas (June 2018) discusses analysis linking new Indigenous enrolments to the proportion of Email/SMS messages provided by state, especially for the 18-39 age group. It identifies lower Email/SMS provision and new enrolments in NT, WA, and SA, hypothesising lower outreach efforts or higher disengagement in these states.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Relevance to FOI Request LS7888:</strong></p>
<p>This document is highly relevant to FOI request LS7888 as it provides direct insight into the <strong>planning and implementation</strong> of the AEC's new methodology for its Indigenous Electoral Participation Program (IEPP) during the 2018-2019 period.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>New Methodology:</strong> It explicitly details the AEC's reliance on self-identified Indigeneity data from Centrelink as a core component of the "more direct method for estimating Indigenous electoral enrolment rates" and identifying potential unenrolled voters, which was a key aspect of the new methodology. The 107,607 figure directly relates to the efforts to identify "over 72,000 potentially unenrolled Indigenous Australians" mentioned in the FOI overview (this document provides a specific number used in early stages).</li>
<li><strong>Planning and Implementation:</strong> The discussions about data refinement (BDM, deceased persons) illustrate the intricate planning and technical implementation steps involved in validating and utilising this new Centrelink-derived dataset.</li>
<li><strong>Outcomes and Enrolment Stimulation:</strong> The analysis concerning Email/SMS outreach and its correlation with new enrolments demonstrates the AEC's efforts to track and refine its strategies for "enrolment stimulation," and identify areas of lower engagement, directly addressing another aspect of the FOI request.</li>
</ul>
<p>The document does <em>not</em> explicitly detail the number of Indigenous people involved in the methodology's development, its final costs, or dedicated AEC staffing, which were identified as gaps in the overall FOI release.</p>

RE: Indigenous enrolment rates [SEC=UNCLASSIFIED]

The estimated enrolled NSW Indigenous rate decreased only 1 percentage point from 87% in 2018 to 86% in 2019. 
This decrease is not statistically significant and falls within an estimation error for these calculations (being this 
difference actually marginal).  

This 1 percentage point difference represents in absolute numbers an increase of the estimated unenrolled NSW 
Indigenous population of 2,285 Indigenous (from 20,954 to 23,239) which then represents an increase of 10.9 per 
cent in unenrolled Indigenous when compared to previous year. However, note that this apparent b g increase is 
because the state size (the biggest in the country in relation to enrolment eligible population) where a decrease in 1 
percentage point in enrolled indigenous then represents a big number in relation to the total estimated unenrolled 
indigenous. For example, if the estimated enrolled QLD indigenous population decreased 1 percentage point too 
from 73% in 2018 to 72% in 2019 (instead of the observed 1 percentage point increase in this period) then this 
decrease will represent a 6.3 per cent increase (2,362) of the estimated unenrolled QLD Indigenous population from 
37,285 to 39,647 Indigenous. In this example, the increase (6.3 per cent) in QLD  s lower than the actual increase 
observed in NSW (10.9 per cent) because the total estimated unenrolled Indigenous population in QLD (37,285 in 
2018) is larger than that estimate in NSW (20,954 in 2018) – NSW has the largest estimated enrolled Indigenous rate 
in the Country at 86 per cent compared to QLD at only 74 per cent.

Guy, 

How did the non‐enrolled Indigenous population in NSW increase by 11%? 

That seems to be the only real outlier to me. In most cases it stayed pretty much the same. I think we will need to be 
prepared to answer the question about NSW. 

Thanks.

There was a small increase nationally from 76.4 per cent to 76.6 per cent, not really significant but better
than a reduction. This continues the upward trend over the last few years with  he 2017 rate at 74.7 per
cent.
The estimated Indigenous eligible enrolment population (EEP) grew by 13,360 people (or 2.7 per cent) while
the estimated number of Indigenous people enrolled grew by 11,455 (3 per cent)
The estimated unenrolled Indigenous population grew from 118,581 to 120,486 (1.6 per cent increase). This
compares unfavourably with the change between 2017 and 2018 where the estimated unenrolled

population grew from 16,275 to 16,433 (1 per cent increase).

There was a small increase in the WA from 63.8 per cent to 65 per cent. This continues the upward trend
over the last few years with the 2017 rate at 62.8 per cent.
The estimated Indigenous EEP for WA grew by 1,790 people (or 2.8 per cent) while the estimated number of

                    <h2>Document Summary: AEC Indigenous Enrolment Rates (September 2019)</h2>
<p>This document is an email exchange from September 2019 between key Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) staff in the National Enrolment Services Branch, primarily Angelo Rojas (Senior Project Officer), Sean Ferrari (Director), and Guy Lewis (Assistant Director). The correspondence discusses the estimated Indigenous electoral enrolment rates for 2019, comparing them to previous years (2017-2018) and anticipating questions from stakeholders.</p>
<h3>Key Points:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>National Enrolment Trends (2017-2019):</strong><ul>
<li>The national Indigenous enrolment rate saw a small increase from 76.4% in 2018 to 76.6% in 2019, continuing an upward trend from 74.7% in 2017.</li>
<li>The estimated Indigenous eligible enrolment population (EEP) grew by 2.7% (13,360 people), while the estimated number of Indigenous people enrolled grew by 3% (11,455 people).</li>
<li>The estimated unenrolled Indigenous population nationally increased by 1.6% (from 118,581 to 120,486), which was noted as "unfavourable" compared to the 4% decrease observed between 2017 and 2018.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>State-Specific Analysis:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>New South Wales (NSW):</strong> Experienced a slight decrease in its estimated Indigenous enrolment rate from 87.3% (2018) to 86.2% (2019). Despite this, the rate was still up from 85.9% in 2017. Critically, the estimated unenrolled NSW Indigenous population grew by 10.9% (from 20,954 to 23,239), which was identified as an "outlier."</li>
<li><strong>Northern Territory (NT) &amp; Western Australia (WA):</strong> Both showed small increases in their enrolment rates and decreases or minor changes in their estimated unenrolled Indigenous populations, continuing upward trends.</li>
<li><strong>Queensland (Qld):</strong> Also recorded a small increase in its enrolment rate, continuing an upward trend from 70% in 2017.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Explanation for NSW Outlier:</strong> Angelo Rojas provided a statistical explanation for the 10.9% increase in unenrolled Indigenous in NSW. He clarified that a 1 percentage point decrease in the enrolment rate (from 87% to 86%) was not statistically significant and fell within estimation error. The seemingly large percentage increase in unenrolled numbers was attributed to NSW having the largest estimated eligible Indigenous population and a high enrolment rate, meaning a small percentage drop affects a relatively smaller base of unenrolled people, thus making the percentage increase of the unenrolled appear higher compared to states with larger unenrolled populations.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Relevance to FOI Request LS7888:</h3>
<p>This document is highly relevant to FOI request LS7888 as it directly addresses the "outcomes" and "impact" aspects of the AEC's new methodology for its Indigenous Electoral Participation Program (IEPP).</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Outcomes:</strong> It provides specific figures for estimated Indigenous enrolment rates for 2019 (national 76.6%), confirming the shift and significant increase in estimated rates compared to the old methodology's 58% and the 2018 rate of 76.4% mentioned in the FOI overview.</li>
<li><strong>Impact:</strong> The detailed national and state-level breakdowns of enrolled and unenrolled Indigenous populations demonstrate the impact of the new methodology in tracking electoral participation and identifying areas of focus (like the NSW outlier). The discussion about the growth of the unenrolled population, nationally and in specific states, directly relates to efforts to track enrolment stimulation.</li>
<li><strong>Planning/Implementation (indirect):</strong> While not detailing the <em>development</em> of the methodology, the email exchange itself reflects the internal AEC processes for discussing, analysing, and preparing to report on the <em>results</em> derived from the new methodology, indicating ongoing implementation and monitoring.</li>
<li><strong>Missing Information:</strong> Consistent with the FOI overview, this document does not provide explicit details on the number of Indigenous people involved in the methodology's development, its final costs, or dedicated AEC staffing for the program.</li>

ESTIMATES BRIEF – HOT ISSUE 

Supplementary Budget Estimates, October 2019 

CURRENT ENROLMENT FIGURES, TRENDS 

Issue 

For the 2019 federal election, more Australians were enrolled than ever before— 
both in terms of raw numbers and as a percentage of the eligible population. 

Key facts and figures 









16,424,248 Australians were enrolled to vote in the 2019 federal election,
representing an enrolment rate of 97.0 per cent.

The youth enrolment rate (18-24 year olds) at the federal election was
88.8 per cent. Like the general population, young people are enrolled at
record levels.

.

The Indigenous enrolment rate remained steady and for 2018-19 the
national estimated Indigenous enrolment rate is at 76.6 per cent.

Key points 

The Australian Electoral Commission works to ensure the full electoral
participation of all eligible Australians. The electoral roll for the 2019
federal election was the largest and most complete ever.

A record 16,424,248 Australians were determined as enrolled to vote in
the 2019 federal election, from of an estimated eligible population of
16.9 million people. This represents an enrolment rate of 97.0 per cent, an
increase on the previous record rate for the 2016 federal election.

Background 

2019 federal election 

 A record 16,424,248 electors were enrolled from of an estimated eligible population of

16.9 million people. This represents a national enrolment rate of 97.0 per cent.







Immediately following the roll close the AEC reported a preliminary enrolment rate of
96.8 per cent. This, however, was subsequently revised to 97.0 per cent following the
application of more up-to-date eligible enrolment population estimates.

The enrolment rate exceeded the AEC’s target of 95 per cent in all states and territories
except the Northern Territory, where it increased from 81.1 per cent at the 2016 election
to 83.9 per cent.

The youth enrolment rate (18-24 year olds) was 88.8 per cent. Like the general
population, young people are enrolled at record levels.

Current state of the roll 

 As at 30 September 2019, the national enrolment rate was 96.8 per cent, which is

0.2 percentage points lower than for the 2019 federal election.





It is normal for the enrolment rate to decline following an election. The estimated number
of people not enrolled has grown by around 37,000 since the election with the vast
majority of these being people who turned 18 following the election.

In the lead up to the 2019 election, the AEC conducted an enrolment stimulation exercise,
targeting 410,000 people nationally who were not enrolled.

Youth enrolment 

 Younger electors tend to enrol in proximity to an electoral event.



The youth enrolment rate (18-24 year olds) as at 30 September 2019 was 86.5 per cent
with 1,643,338 enrolled youth, a reduction of 2.3 percentage points since the federal
election.

 While the AEC works to maintain the youth enrolment rate as high as possible, it is not

unusual for the youth enrolment rate to improve at the time of a federal election and then
decline between elections.

Indigenous enrolment 



The AEC commenced publication of Indigenous enrolment rate estimates by state and
territory as at 30 June 2018.

 A previous national Indigenous enrolment estimate of 58 per cent was calculated in 2014

using a different methodology.



The national Indigenous enrolment rate estimate remains steady and as at 30 June 2019
the rate was 76.6 per cent compared with 76.4 per cent in 2018.

 Any gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous enrolment rates is concerning.



The AEC is working to ensure the full electoral participation of all eligible Australians
and is investing in partnerships and targeted activities that extend its reach into remote
communities. Remote Area Mobile Polling remains an important component of election
service delivery.

Northern Territory enrolment 





Enrolment in the Northern Territory has shown consistent improvement.

The enrolment rate in the Northern Territory increased by 9.8 percentage points between
30 June 2010 and 30 June 2019 while the national enrolment rate increased by
7.4 percentage points.

                    <h3>Document Summary</h3>
<p>This document, an "Estimates Brief – Hot Issue" from October 2019, provides an overview of enrolment figures and trends for the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC), particularly in the lead-up to Supplementary Budget Estimates. It highlights record national enrolment rates of 97.0% for the 2019 federal election and a youth enrolment rate of 88.8%.</p>
<p>Crucially, the brief details Indigenous enrolment rates, stating that the AEC commenced publication of these estimates by state and territory as of 30 June 2018. It explicitly contrasts the national estimated Indigenous enrolment rate of 76.6% (as at 30 June 2019, and 76.4% in 2018) with a "previous national Indigenous enrolment estimate of 58 per cent calculated in 2014 using a different methodology." The document also notes the AEC's ongoing efforts to ensure full electoral participation for all eligible Australians, including targeted activities and partnerships in remote communities, and mentions an enrolment stimulation exercise targeting 410,000 unenrolled people before the 2019 election.</p>
<h3>Relevance to FOI Request LS7888</h3>
<p>This document is highly relevant to FOI request LS7888, which sought information on the AEC's new methodology for its Indigenous Electoral Participation Program (IEPP) from 2018-2019.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>New Methodology &amp; Outcomes:</strong> The document directly addresses the shift in methodology by clearly stating the AEC began publishing new Indigenous enrolment rates from June 2018 and contrasting them with the 2014 estimate based on a "different methodology." It provides the exact "outcomes" requested by the FOI, confirming the new estimated Indigenous enrolment rates of 76.4% (June 2018) and 76.6% (June 2019), which directly reflect the impact of the new approach (as described in the FOI overview, likely due to Centrelink data).</li>
<li><strong>Timeframe:</strong> The document falls squarely within the 2018-2019 timeframe of the FOI request, providing data points from this period.</li>
<li><strong>Implementation (Implicit):</strong> While not detailing the planning or explicit implementation steps of the new methodology's <em>development</em>, it confirms its <em>application</em> by stating when the new estimates began to be published.</li>
<li><strong>Missing Information:</strong> Consistent with the FOI overview, this document does not provide specific details on the number of Indigenous people involved in the methodology's development, its final costs, or dedicated AEC staffing, thus aligning with the gaps identified in the released content for LS7888.</li>

Indigenous Franchise KPIs using Centrelink data 

Background 
As Australia’s federal electoral roll does not have a personal Indigenous identifier, estimating the enrolment, 
 rates for Indigenous persons is problematic. Having these key franchise KPIs for the 

Indigenous population is important for Closing the Gap purposes and the AECs focus on how the franchise 
could be better delivered. 

In 2014 the AEC’s Research Section commenced indirect estimation of these figures, using a regression model 
of the relationship between the Indigenous population and each of the three franchise KPIs at a small area 
level, such as polling place catchment or the ABS’ SA2 geography. While the models did not fit the data 
particularly well, the resulting Indigenous enrolment, 
real data, rather than anecdote. Yet the resulting enrolment and turnout rates in particular were alarmingly 
low, and hopefully represented a worst case picture. 

 rates were statistically based on 

Centrelink Data 
Around the same time, the Research Section informally proposed that person-level Centrelink extracts that the 
AEC received occasionally for other Roll validation work, could perhaps be extended to include Centrelink’s 
Indigenous indicator. This came to fruition in 20171. 

As part of the Annual Roll Integrity Review (ARIR), the person-level matching between the Roll and Centrelink 
now included Centrelink’s Indigenous indicator. However as Centrelink customers represent only around half 
of the Roll, the matching (even if perfect) would be far from assigning all enrolments an Indigenous flag. 
Nevertheless, for the first time the AEC has a very large number of enrolled persons, over 6 million, with an 
explicit Indigenous status. 

Enrolment Rate

1.
The enrolment rate, even for all persons regardless of indigenaity, is difficult to calculate reliably due to 
conceptual, collection and methodological differences between the Roll (numerator) and the ABS-based 
enrolment-eligible population (denominator, “EEP”). In the case of the Indigenous population these problems 
are magnified by having no Indigenous identifier on the Roll and less reliable estimates of Indigenous EEP.  

However, matching the Roll to Centrelink data allows a more direct method of estimating the Indigenous 
enrolment rate. It is still subject to quite courageous assumptions, but as fewer are required it likely 
represents an improved approach. In summary: 









For all Centrelink customers with an identified Indigenous or non-Indigenous status, calculate the
proportion on the Roll. This is the raw enrolment rate of Centrelink clients.
Calculate the ratio of the actual AEC enrolment rate versus the Centrelink-based rate, for the same
point in time. This is the overall factor to adjust any Centrelink-based rates to align with AEC
enrolment rates.
Apply the adjustment factor to raw Centrelink-based enrolment rates by Indigenous status to give
Indigenous and non-Indigenous enrolment rates.
This process can be done at the State level, though results will have lower reliability.

NOTE: While this method avoids indirectly modelling Indigenous enrolment rates via geographic 
association, it does assume that any bias in Centrelink clients being enrolled is equal for 
Indigenous and non-Indigenous, and that there are no substantive Indigenous-status biases 
inherent in the Roll-to-Centrelink person matching.

Conclusion and Results 
The Centrelink client file with Indigenous indicator newly available to the AEC has presented an excellent 
opportunity, via matching to the Roll 

, to improve estimation of Indigenous franchise KPIs.  

While the results are subject to a number of non-trivial assumptions, the more direct estimation methods lead 
to a higher likelihood of robust results. The figures should nevertheless still be regarded as indicative only.

                    <h2>Document Summary and Relevance to FOI Request LS7888</h2>
<p>This document, titled "Indigenous Franchise KPIs using Centrelink data" and dated 8 May 2018, details the Australian Electoral Commission's (AEC) new methodology for estimating Indigenous electoral enrolment rates.</p>
<p><strong>Document Summary:</strong></p>
<p>The document outlines the AEC's challenge in accurately estimating Indigenous electoral participation due to the absence of a specific Indigenous identifier on the federal electoral roll. It describes a shift from an earlier (2014) indirect regression model, which yielded "alarmingly low" and less reliable estimates, to a more direct approach leveraging Centrelink's self-identified Indigenous status data.</p>
<p>Beginning in 2017, the AEC integrated Centrelink's Indigenous indicator into its Annual Roll Integrity Review (ARIR) through person-level matching, providing explicit Indigenous status for over 6 million enrolled persons. The new methodology involves:<br />
1.  Calculating the raw enrolment rate for identified Indigenous and non-Indigenous Centrelink clients.<br />
2.  Determining an adjustment factor by comparing the overall AEC enrolment rate with the Centrelink-based rate.<br />
3.  Applying this factor to derive adjusted Indigenous and non-Indigenous enrolment rates.</p>
<p>While acknowledging that the results are indicative and rely on certain assumptions, the document concludes that this method provides a "higher likelihood of robust results." It presents indicative national non-enrolment figures for 30 June 2017, showing a 29% non-enrolment rate for Indigenous Australians (implying a 71% enrolment rate) compared to 3% for non-Indigenous Australians. The development of this method is attributed to the AEC's Research Section, with acknowledgment to the former Electoral Integrity Unit and the IT Branch.</p>
<p><strong>Relevance to FOI Request LS7888:</strong></p>
<p>This document is highly relevant to FOI request LS7888, which sought information on the AEC's new methodology for its Indigenous Electoral Participation Program (IEPP) from 2018-2019.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>New Methodology:</strong> The document directly addresses the core of the FOI request by detailing the <em>new methodology</em> for estimating Indigenous electoral enrolment using Centrelink data, replacing the previous 2014 model. This shift from an indirect, less accurate method to a more direct, data-driven approach is a central theme of the request.</li>
<li><strong>Planning &amp; Implementation:</strong> It outlines the genesis of this shift, from an "informal proposal" by the Research Section to its "fruition in 2017" and integration into the ARIR, indicating the planning and initial implementation phases within the requested timeframe.</li>
<li><strong>Outcomes:</strong> The document provides initial <em>outcomes</em> of this new methodology, presenting estimated Indigenous non-enrolment rates for 2017 that are significantly higher (indicating lower non-enrolment) than those implied by the previous methodology's "alarmingly low" figures mentioned in the FOI overview (e.g., 71% enrolment vs. ~58%). This demonstrates the immediate impact of the methodological change on reported rates.</li>
<li><strong>Indigenous Involvement:</strong> The document does <em>not</em> explicitly detail the number of Indigenous people involved in the methodology's development, which was a specific aspect of the FOI request that the released content did not fully address.</li>
<li><strong>Costs/Staffing:</strong> Similarly, the document does <em>not</em> explicitly detail the final costs or dedicated AEC staffing associated with the development or ongoing use of this methodology. It only mentions the AEC sections involved.</li>
<li><strong>Timeline:</strong> Dated May 2018 and presenting 2017 data, the document falls squarely within the 2018-2019 period of the FOI request, providing insight into the foundational work and early results of the new methodology.</li>

Indigenous Franchise KPIs using Centrelink data 

Background 
As Australia’s federal electoral roll does not have a personal Indigenous identifier, estimating the enrolment, 
 rates for Indigenous persons is problematic. Having these key franchise KPIs for the 

Indigenous population is important for Closing the Gap purposes and the AECs focus on how the franchise 
could be better delivered. 

In 2014 the AEC’s Research Section commenced indirect estimation of these figures, using a regression model 
of the relationship between the Indigenous population and each of the three franchise KPIs at a small area 
level, such as polling place catchment or the ABS’ SA2 geography. While the models did not fit the data 
particularly well, the resulting Indigenous enrolment, 
real data, rather than anecdote. Yet the resulting enrolment and turnout rates in particular were alarmingly 
low, and hopefully represented a worst case picture. 

 rates were statistically based on 

Centrelink Data 
Around the same time, the Research Section informally proposed that person-level Centrelink extracts that the 
AEC received occasionally for other Roll validation work, could perhaps be extended to include Centrelink’s 
Indigenous indicator. This came to fruition in 20171. 

As part of the Annual Roll Integrity Review (ARIR), the person-level matching between the Roll and Centrelink 
now included Centrelink’s Indigenous indicator. However as Centrelink customers represent only around half 
of the Roll, the matching (even if perfect) would be far from assigning all enrolments an Indigenous flag. 
Nevertheless, for the first time the AEC has a very large number of enrolled persons, over 6 million, with an 
explicit Indigenous status. 

Enrolment Rate

1.
The enrolment rate, even for all persons regardless of indigenaity, is difficult to calculate reliably due to 
conceptual, collection and methodological differences between the Roll (numerator) and the ABS-based 
enrolment-eligible population (denominator, “EEP”). In the case of the Indigenous population these problems 
are magnified by having no Indigenous identifier on the Roll and less reliable estimates of Indigenous EEP.  

However, matching the Roll to Centrelink data allows a more direct method of estimating the Indigenous 
enrolment rate. It is still subject to quite significant assumptions, but as fewer are required it likely represents 
an improved approach. In summary: 









For all Centrelink customers with an identified Indigenous or non-Indigenous status, calculate the
proportion on the Roll. This is the raw enrolment rate of Centrelink clients.
Apply the raw enrolment rates to Indigenous and non-Indigenous EEP benchmarks2 to yield draft
Indigenous status enrolments. Calculate the factor to scale these to the overall enrolments used in the
AEC’s published enrolment rates.
Apply the adjustment factor to the draft Indigenous status enrolments, then recalculate the enrolment
rates against the EEP benchmarks.
This process can be done at the State level, though results will have lower reliability.

NOTE: While this method avoids indirectly modelling Indigenous enrolment rates via geographic 
association, it does assume that any bias in Centrelink clients being enrolled is equal for 
Indigenous and non-Indigenous, and that there are no substantive Indigenous-status biases 
inherent in the Roll-to-Centrelink person matching.

Specifically, the request aimed to uncover:\n*   Planning documents and the catalyst for the new methodology.\n*   Progress reports and internal communications regarding its design, testing, and implementation.\n*   Details on how implementation was tracked, including comparisons with prior methodologies.\n*   Final summary reports on the outcomes.\n*   Information on the number of Indigenous people involved in the planning, design, and implementation.\n*   The final cost of the methodology's design, testing, and implementation, including AEC staffer numbers.\n\n### Documents from the FOI Request\n\nThe released documents comprise a schedule of 41 items (some subsuming others) and several redacted document excerpts. The types of documents include:\n*   **Internal Emails:** Correspondence between various AEC staff members (Assistant Directors, Directors, Senior Project Officers, Consultants, Data Analysts) discussing Indigenous data, enrolment rates, parliamentary reviews, and ministerial briefings.\n*   **Papers/Reports:** Documents titled \"Indigenous Franchise KPIs using Centrelink data\" and \"Analysis of Indigenous Enrolment.\"\n*   **Ministerial Submissions & Briefs:** Formal documents prepared for Ministers and parliamentary estimates hearings (e.g., \"Ministerial Submission re Publication of Indigenous enrolment rates,\" \"Estimates Brief \u2013 Hot Issue re Indigenous,\" \"Estimates Brief \u2013 Hot Issue \u2013 Supplementary Budget Estimates\").\n*   **Redaction Codes List:** A list detailing the types of information redacted from the documents.\n\n### Main Content from the FOI Request Documents\n\nThe core content of the released documents focuses heavily on the AEC's shift to a new, more direct methodology for estimating Indigenous electoral enrolment rates, primarily leveraging self-identified Indigeneity data from Centrelink (Department of Human Services).\n\n**Key Insights from the Documents:**\n\n*   **Catalyst for New Methodology:** The availability of person-level Centrelink extracts that included an Indigenous indicator from 2017 onwards was the primary catalyst. Previously, the AEC used an indirect regression model, which yielded \"alarmingly low\" and less robust Indigenous enrolment rates.\n*   **New Methodology Details:** The new approach involves:\n    *   Calculating the proportion of Centrelink customers (with identified Indigenous or non-Indigenous status) who are on the electoral roll.\n    *   Adjusting these raw Centrelink-based rates to align with overall AEC enrolment rates, applying this factor to Indigenous and non-Indigenous data.\n    *   The methodology aims to provide more direct and robust estimates, though it still relies on assumptions (e.g., no bias in Centrelink client enrolment or matching for Indigenous/non-Indigenous individuals).\n*   **Improved Enrolment Rates:** The new methodology revealed significantly higher estimated Indigenous enrolment rates:\n    *   As at June 30, 2018, the national Indigenous enrolment rate was estimated at **76.4%**. This was a substantial increase from the previous estimates of **58%** (calculated in 2014 using the old methodology).\n    *   As at June 30, 2019, the national rate remained steady at **76.6%**, continuing an upward trend from 74.7% in 2017.\n    *   The estimated unenrolled Indigenous population was around 118,581 in June 2018, increasing slightly to 120,486 by June 2019.\n*   **Implementation Tracking & Enrolment Stimulation:**\n    *   The Centrelink data identified 72,451 \"potentially unenrolled Indigenous Australians\" in July 2018.\n    *   An enrolment stimulation event in February/March 2019 resulted in 2,646 Indigenous Australians enrolling, reducing the identified unenrolled cohort to 69,143.\n    *   Internal discussions reveal efforts to refine the data analysis, particularly concerning older Indigenous Australians and potential matching errors.\n    *   There were internal discussions (emails from Sept 2019) about state-level variations, such as a noted increase in the unenrolled Indigenous population in NSW, though it was deemed not statistically significant given the state's size.\n*   **Reporting and Transparency:** The AEC prepared ministerial submissions and estimates briefs to communicate these updated enrolment figures to the government and parliament, emphasizing the improved methodology and increased rates. Discussions noted the importance of clearly stating the estimated nature of the data (\"estimates on top of estimates\") due to the lack of a direct Indigenous identifier on the federal roll.\n\n**Information Not Explicitly Addressed in Released Content:**\n\n*   The documents do not explicitly outline the **number of Indigenous people involved by the AEC in the planning, design, and implementation** of the new methodology in terms of project personnel or consultants.\n*   The documents also do not detail the **final cost of the design, testing, and implementation of the new methodology, nor the specific number of AEC staffers assigned to the task.** While staff names and roles appear in emails, a dedicated breakdown of staffing or costs for the project is not present in the provided snippets or document descriptions.", "model": "gemini-2.5-flash", "generated_at": "2025-06-21T23:53:11.678962", "source_hash": "1907af13954f60461ed0bd374d714fd949738ff69c3abae2597a974ed3b7a07f", "raw_response_path": "data/llm_responses/LS7888__overall__balanced__20250621T235311.json", "output_tokens": 1160, "prompt_tokens": 46612, "total_tokens": 49677, "summary_length": 5526}, "short_index": {"text": "FOI request LS7888 sought documents from 2018-2019 concerning the Australian Electoral Commission's (AEC) new methodology for its Indigenous Electoral Participation Program (IEPP), specifically regarding its planning, implementation, outcomes, Indigenous involvement, and costs.

In 2017, internal AEC research suggested around 42% of Indigenous people were not enrolled to vote, compared to a much lower non-Indigenous non-enrolment rate (29% vs. 3% in 2017, respectively). This stark difference underscores a fundamental social justice issue: unequal access to democratic participation for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples.\n\nThe AEC's new methodology, relying on self-identified Indigeneity data from Centrelink (Department of Human Services), represents a pragmatic effort to improve the accuracy of Indigenous enrolment estimates and to better target unenrolled individuals. This initiative aligns with progressive values that seek to dismantle barriers to participation and promote equity, especially for historically marginalized groups, and is explicitly linked to \"Closing the Gap\" objectives. Progress is noted, with national Indigenous enrolment rates estimated to have risen from 74.7% in 2017 to 76.6% in 2019. The \"enrolment stimulation event\" in early 2019, which enrolled 2,646 Indigenous Australians, demonstrates a proactive approach to rectify historical under-enrolment.\n\nHowever, a critical progressive concern emerges from the documents: the continued absence of a direct Indigenous identifier on the federal electoral roll. This systemic issue forces the AEC to rely on indirect methods, such as data matching with Centrelink. The documents repeatedly caveat these estimates as \"indicative only\" and based on \"courageous assumptions,\" implying inherent limitations and a less-than-ideal solution. The reliance on Centrelink data, while practical, also means targeting primarily those Indigenous Australians who are already engaging with social security services and have self-identified within that system, potentially missing other unenrolled individuals.\n\nFurthermore, a notable anomaly appears in the 2019 data, where the estimated unenrolled Indigenous population in New South Wales significantly increased by 10.9% (from 20,954 to 23,239), despite overall national improvements. This suggests that the new methodologies might not be consistently effective across all regions or that other structural factors are at play, warranting deeper investigation from a social justice perspective.\n\nCrucially, the FOI request explicitly asked for \"documentation... outlining the number of Indigenous people involved by the AEC in the planning, design and implementation of the new methodology.\" The released documents contain **no information** addressing this vital request. From a left-leaning standpoint, the lack of demonstrated Indigenous involvement in a program specifically designed to enhance their electoral participation is a significant deviation from principles of self-determination and co-design, raising questions about the authenticity and effectiveness of the initiative's community engagement.\n\n**Civil Liberties: Data Sharing and Privacy**\n\nThe use of Centrelink data for electoral purposes raises important civil liberties concerns related to privacy and inter-agency data sharing. While framed as a necessary tool to address the lack of an Indigenous identifier on the electoral roll, the linkage of sensitive personal information (Indigenous status, welfare recipient data) with electoral records warrants scrutiny. The documents do not detail whether explicit consent is sought from individuals for this data sharing or the robustness of privacy safeguards in place. For progressive analysts, this highlights a potential erosion of individual privacy and the blurring of lines between social support and civic duties, especially when compulsory enrolment is involved.\n\n**Other Issues: Environmental Impact, Wealth Distribution, Corporate Influence**\n\nThe provided documents do not contain information related to environmental impact, wealth distribution beyond the indirect implication of Centrelink data usage, or corporate influence on the IEPP or AEC policies.\n\n**Overall Progressive Assessment**\n\nWhile the AEC's efforts to improve Indigenous electoral enrolment are commendable and align with the progressive goal of universal suffrage and social justice, the documents reveal critical shortcomings. The persistent reliance on indirect, \"indicative only\" data due to the lack of a direct Indigenous identifier on the electoral roll itself points to a systemic failing. Furthermore, the absence of transparency regarding Indigenous involvement in the program's design and implementation, coupled with unresolved questions around data privacy in inter-agency sharing, raises significant concerns about the depth of commitment to genuine self-determination and robust civil liberties within this critical initiative.", "model": "gemini-2.5-flash", "generated_at": "2025-06-21T23:27:42.291448", "source_hash": "8cc83be31d1596d9caae5f32bd8fdc56f4d469ec5888b70d33f1408ada291b27", "raw_response_path": "data/llm_responses/LS7888__overall__left_leaning__20250621T232742.json", "output_tokens": 962, "prompt_tokens": 47285, "total_tokens": 50727, "summary_length": 5247}, "short_index": {"text": "The Australian Electoral Commission's Indigenous Electoral Participation Program (IEPP) between 2018 and 2019 presents a mixed picture from a left-leaning perspective.

While ostensibly aimed at improving electoral integrity and participation, the actions highlight areas of concern regarding fiscal responsibility, individual liberty, and the scope of government.\n\n**Economic Efficiency and Fiscal Responsibility:**\nThe documents indicate a shift by the AEC from less reliable \"indirect estimation\" methods to a \"more direct method\" of calculating Indigenous enrolment rates, primarily by leveraging self-identified Indigeneity data from the Department of Human Services (Centrelink). This is presented as leading to \"more robust results.\" From an efficiency standpoint, utilizing existing government data sources, rather than developing entirely new collection mechanisms, could be seen as a sensible approach to resource allocation. However, a significant deviation from conservative principles of fiscal transparency is evident: the FOI request explicitly sought details on the \"final cost of the design, testing and implementation of the new methodology\" and the \"number of AEC staffers assigned,\" yet **no such financial or staffing information is provided in the released documents.** This lack of accountability for public expenditure on a new program or methodology is a serious concern, preventing a proper cost-benefit analysis and hindering oversight of taxpayer funds. The mention of \"enrolment stimulation events\" in February/March 2019, which led to the enrolment of 2,646 Indigenous Australians, represents a direct programmatic expense whose cost remains undisclosed.\n\n**Individual Liberty and Limited Government:**\nThe core of the new methodology relies on the AEC accessing and matching individuals' self-identified Indigenous status from Centrelink records with the electoral roll. While the AEC states that the electoral roll itself \"does not have a personal Indigenous identifier,\" this inter-agency data sharing effectively creates a de facto administrative identifier, raising significant questions about data privacy and the expanding reach of government. For conservatives, who advocate for limited government and strong protections for individual liberty, the aggregation and cross-use of personal data across different government functions (welfare administration and electoral management) can be viewed as an encroachment on privacy. The stated purpose of this data use, to \"enhance Indigenous enrolment\" for \"Closing the Gap purposes,\" while presented as a social good, also highlights an expansion of the AEC's role beyond its core function of maintaining an accurate and fair electoral roll to active participation in social engineering outcomes. This active pursuit of specific demographic enrolment rates, rather than a neutral, universal application of electoral law, deviates from the principle of a strictly limited government.\n\n**Outcomes and Deviations:**\nThe new methodology has reportedly led to an increase in estimated national Indigenous enrolment rates, rising from a previously \"alarmingly low\" 58% (2014) to 76.4% in June 2018 and 76.6% in June 2019. While an overall improvement in enrolment is desirable for a robust democracy, the internal documents also highlight an 11% increase in the estimated *unenrolled* Indigenous population in New South Wales between 2018 and 2019, prompting internal questions about the data's nuances. This fluctuation, coupled with the inherent \"courageous assumptions\" acknowledged in the methodology, reinforces the conservative view that complex government interventions, particularly those involving extensive data aggregation and social objectives, often lack precision and can obscure true efficacy while increasing administrative burden and reducing transparency.\n\nIn conclusion, these documents reveal the AEC's initiative to improve Indigenous electoral participation through a data-driven methodology. However, the undisclosed costs, the reliance on cross-agency data sharing impacting individual privacy, and the broader \"Closing the Gap\" mandate that pushes the AEC into social policy territory, represent significant deviations from conservative principles of fiscal responsibility, individual liberty, and limited government.

Notably absent are detailed planning documents, formal progress reports, any figures on Indigenous people involved in the program's design, and crucially, any information on the final cost or staffing allocated to this \"new methodology.\" This withholding of basic accountability metrics immediately raises suspicions of a deliberate lack of transparency regarding public funds and genuine community engagement.\n\nThe \"new methodology\" itself appears to be less about tangible improvements in Indigenous enrolment and more about an advantageous shift in measurement. Previously, the AEC's own 2014 research indicated an \"alarmingly low\" Indigenous enrolment rate of around 58%. The new approach, leveraging Centrelink data, conveniently presented a dramatically \"improved\" rate of 76.4% in 2018, rising slightly to 76.6% in 2019. However, internal documents reveal this new method relies on \"courageous assumptions\" and produces figures that \"should nevertheless still be regarded as indicative only\" and \"not and cannot be considered 100% accurate.\" The Deputy Electoral Commissioner explicitly warned against the \"critical context\" of these caveats being \"lost over time,\" implying a risk of deliberate misrepresentation at higher levels.\n\nFurther scrutiny reveals significant operational inefficiencies. A key \"enrolment stimulation event\" in early 2019, targeting over 72,000 \"potentially unenrolled Indigenous Australians\" identified through the new data, resulted in a meager 2,646 enrolments\u2014a conversion rate of approximately 3.6%. This constitutes a significant waste of resources on an ineffective outreach strategy. Internal emails also highlight persistent data quality issues, such as \"significant matching error\" for older Indigenous Australians, undermining the very \"robustness\" claimed for the new methodology. Compounding this, a data analyst noted that 2019 enrolment figures initially looked \"strange\" and required a \"fix\" before being reported, raising concerns about the reliability and rigor of internal reporting.\n\nIn essence, the documents suggest that rather than genuinely addressing the deep-seated issues leading to low Indigenous enrolment, the AEC focused on a new, statistically dubious methodology that presented a more palatable picture.

The core concern, from a right-leaning perspective, is the potential for government overreach and a deviation from the principle of limited government in electoral administration.\n\nThe schedule of released documents provides further evidence supporting these concerns:\n\n1.  **Government Overreach and Privacy Infringement:** Multiple entries, such as \"Minute from Guy Lewis... re Using DHS Indigeneity data to enhance Indigenous enrolment\" (Document No. 4) and \"Paper titled Indigenous Franchise KPIs using Centrelink data\" (Document No. 7, 31), highlight the AEC's active reliance on Centrelink (Department of Human Services) data. This confirms the concern that the AEC is engaging in cross-agency data sharing to create a de facto administrative identifier for Indigenous Australians, thereby expanding government reach beyond its core electoral function into social engineering. This practice infringes on individual privacy by linking electoral participation to welfare data, potentially setting a dangerous precedent for government tracking of citizens based on self-identified characteristics.\n\n2.  **Lack of Fiscal Transparency and Accountability:** Crucially, the FOI request explicitly sought \"Documentation... outlining the final cost of the design, testing and implementation of the new methodology\" (Request point 6) and \"details of the number of AEC staffers assigned to the task.\" The \"SCHEDULE OF RELEASED DOCUMENTS\" for FOI Request LS7888 contains *no* entry that directly addresses or provides these vital cost details.

The inability or unwillingness to disclose the full financial implications of this new methodology raises serious questions about fiscal responsibility and value for money, especially for a program that actively pursues specific demographic enrolment rates rather than universally administering electoral law.\n\n3.  **Deviation from Neutral Electoral Administration:** The repeated appearance of \"Ministerial Submission from Tom Rogers... to Alex Hawke, Special Minister of State re Publication of Indigenous enrolment rates\" (Document No. 17) and \"Estimates Brief \u2013 Hot Issue... re Indigenous\" (Document No. 19, 41) indicates direct political and parliamentary oversight, suggesting this program is not merely a technical improvement but a targeted effort driven by political objectives like \"Closing the Gap\" mandates. This emphasis on achieving specific enrolment targets for a particular demographic, rather than maintaining a universally accessible and neutral electoral roll, represents a move away from limited government and risks politicizing electoral administration at the expense of national interest in neutral governance.

The detailed list of internal communications, including emails and minutes from dedicated AEC staff across various branches, underscores the meticulous planning and collaborative effort involved in designing, testing, and implementing the new data-driven methodology for the Indigenous Electoral Participation Program (IEPP) during 2018-2019.\n\nThe documents reveal a sophisticated, evidence-based strategy, evidenced by the recurrent mentions of \"Indigenous data,\" \"Indigenous Franchise KPIs using Centrelink data,\" and \"Analysis of Indigenous Enrolment.\" This indicates the AEC's proactive use of inter-agency data (like DHS Indigeneity data) to precisely identify and track enrolment rates, ensuring a robust and accurate understanding of the target population.

This document directly corroborates and provides internal AEC confirmation for the \"old 2014 methodology\" figure of 58% enrolment (42% unenrolled).\n*   **Acknowledgement of Methodological Evolution:** Michael Roden's comment about \"many methodological changes since then\" explicitly acknowledges the evolution of the AEC's approach to estimating Indigenous enrolment rates, which is central to the FOI request's focus on the \"new methodology.\"\n*   **Historical Data Point:** By confirming the source and nature of the 2014 enrolment estimate (regression-based and cited in a 2015 ANAO report), the document provides crucial historical context against which the impact and outcomes of the new methodology (Centrelink data-driven) can be understood.\n*   While it does not detail the planning, implementation, Indigenous involvement, or specific costs of the *new* methodology, it solidifies the understanding of the baseline from which the AEC began its improvements in Indigenous electoral participation estimation.", "model": "gemini-2.5-flash", "generated_at": "2025-06-21T23:58:47.418378", "source_hash": "dd79af9eb3c54e1125c42485aa2d025a3ecd95eebf32b9b7693082151e75e799", "raw_response_path": "data/llm_responses/LS7888__per_file__balanced__7888-018.pdf__20250621T235847.json", "output_tokens": 583, "prompt_tokens": 1794, "total_tokens": 3624, "summary_length": 2613}, "left_leaning": {"needs_summary": true, "source_hash": "0dbda39b1393cc96a1a4209594d3a4365650ac4f19f38dfad687560ad217b8e3", "text": "This document highlights AEC staff grappling with historical data concerning Indigenous electoral enrolment, specifically an estimate from 2014 indicating 42% of Indigenous people were not enrolled.

The casual dismissal by Michael Roden that the figure was merely a \"first cut\" from \"tentatively trialled\" regression methods, alongside claims of \"many methodological changes since then,\" underscores a pattern of inconsistent and evolving data methodologies. This suggests an agency more focused on retrospectively explaining away unfavourable statistics and managing public perception than maintaining transparent, consistent data integrity. The need for internal staff to scramble to verify a publicly quoted statistic, which originated from their own work (as cited in a 2015 ANAO report), points to a lack of robust accountability and an environment where crucial program data is not readily verifiable or consistently tracked.

Document No. 19/19444/1945\n\nThis document, identified as part of FOI release LS7888, primarily consists of administrative information pertaining to the Freedom of Information Act 1982. The initial pages display standard FOI release numbering and disclaimers. The substantive content is a list of \"REDACTION CODES\" (Page 4), which enumerates and defines various categories of information that may be withheld or redacted from documents released under the FOI Act, such as personal information, business information, deliberative material, and electoral roll data. The document itself contains no direct content, data, or discussion related to the Australian Electoral Commission's (AEC) Indigenous Electoral Participation Program (IEPP) new methodology.\n\n### Relevance to FOI Request LS7888\n\nThis document's relevance to FOI request LS7888 is purely administrative. It does not contain any direct information or detail concerning the AEC's new methodology for its Indigenous Electoral Participation Program (IEPP), its planning, implementation, outcomes, Indigenous involvement, or costs, which are the core subjects of the request. Instead, it serves as a key or legend for understanding the types of information that may have been redacted from *other* documents released as part of the broader LS7888 FOI disclosure.

From a left-leaning perspective, the extensive categories for redaction, particularly \"Deliberative material\" (18), \"internal operations\" (16), and \"Proper and efficient conduct of the operations of AEC\" (23), are deeply concerning for democratic accountability.\n\nThis opacity directly hinders public scrutiny of the program's planning and design, reinforcing the stated problem of a lack of Indigenous involvement and co-design in the IEPP. The potential for redacting \"Tests, examinations or audits material\" (21) further raises alarms, as it could obscure critical assessments of the program\u2019s efficacy or ethical implications, particularly concerning the contentious use of sensitive Centrelink data and its civil liberties ramifications. Even \"Legal Professional Communication\" (17) could conceal internal advice on these privacy issues or the broader implications for Indigenous self-determination.\n\nUltimately, this document highlights the AEC's power to limit transparency, which, in the context of a program vital for Indigenous electoral equity, undermines the very principles of open governance and community-led solutions essential for genuine social justice.

Key points include:\n\n*   **Increased Enrolment:** The national Indigenous enrolment rate was estimated at 76.4% as of 30 June 2018, a significant increase from previous estimates of 58%. This indicates a faster growth rate for Indigenous enrolment compared to the overall electoral roll.\n*   **New Methodology:** The revised estimates are based on an \"improved methodology\" utilising more robust data, specifically self-identified Indigeneity data provided by the Department of Human Services (Centrelink) and population data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS). This new methodology will be updated annually.\n*   **Positive Trends (2017-2018):** Between 30 June 2017 and 30 June 2018, the estimated number of enrolled Indigenous Australians increased by 5.1% (from 364,631 to 383,078), while the estimated number of non-enrolled Indigenous Australians decreased by 4% (from 123,517 to 118,581).\n*   **Strategic Use:** The AEC states that these new estimates will inform future strategies aimed at further increasing electoral participation by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people.\n*   **State-by-State Data:** The document includes a table showing Indigenous enrolment rates for each state and territory as of June 2017 and June 2018, demonstrating a positive change across all jurisdictions.\n\n### Relevance to FOI Request LS7888\n\nThis document is highly relevant to FOI request LS7888 as it directly addresses several core aspects:\n\n*   **New Methodology:** It explicitly details the \"new methodology\" for estimating Indigenous enrolment rates, confirming the shift from the 2014 methodology (58% estimate) and the utilisation of Centrelink's self-identified Indigeneity data, a key finding of the FOI request.\n*   **Implementation & Outcomes:** The brief serves as a formal communication of the implementation of this new methodology and its immediate \"outcomes,\" presenting the significantly increased estimated enrolment rate of 76.4% by June 2018, which aligns precisely with the figures highlighted in the FOI overview.\n*   **Planning & Context:** Although not detailing the planning process itself, the document is an output of that planning, reflecting the AEC's internal reporting on the results of its updated approach to Indigenous electoral participation.\n*   **Timeframe:** Dated February 2019, the document falls squarely within the 2018-2019 period specified by the FOI request.\n*   **Program Information:** It states that these new estimates will \"further inform the strategies that the AEC is delivering to further increase electoral participation by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people,\" directly linking the methodology's results to the ongoing Indigenous Electoral Participation Program (IEPP).", "model": "gemini-2.5-flash", "generated_at": "2025-06-21T23:59:04.387881", "source_hash": "a73c332aa8cb000e19b10814b7d8caee9e69c567a99694aae88d3e6b07ae09f8", "raw_response_path": "data/llm_responses/LS7888__per_file__balanced__7888-020.pdf__20250621T235904.json", "output_tokens": 690, "prompt_tokens": 1509, "total_tokens": 3372, "summary_length": 3102}, "left_leaning": {"needs_summary": true, "source_hash": "0593c4fde72624c82986b3ae70ee15a0adcaa0fa0e7b65b8734577a83b7ca39f", "text": "The document, an \"Estimates Brief\" from February 2019, presents the Australian Electoral Commission's (AEC) assessment of Indigenous enrolment rates, reporting an increase to 76.4% nationally as of June 2018. While framed by the AEC as \"encouraging\" progress and faster growth than the general roll, a left-leaning analysis reveals deeper, problematic implications for social equity and democratic accountability.\n\nCrucially, the document explicitly states these \"more robust\" estimates rely on \"self-identified Indigeneity data by the Department of Human Services.\" This reliance on Centrelink data, rather than a direct Indigenous identifier on the electoral roll itself, fundamentally reinforces the systemic failing identified in the overall FOI overview. It highlights a troubling blurring of lines between social support and civic duties, raising significant civil liberties and privacy concerns. The fact that the AEC must resort to such indirect and external data underscores the continued absence of a dedicated, self-determined mechanism for Indigenous enrolment, which could empower greater agency and direct participation.\n\nFurthermore, while celebrating improved estimates, the document provides no indication of Indigenous involvement in the design or planning of these data collection methodologies or the strategies they are meant to inform. This absence of co-design, a core principle of self-determination, means that even as enrolment numbers are estimated to rise, the underlying process remains top-down, rather than community-led. Thus, while seemingly positive on the surface, this document inadvertently reveals the persistent systemic barriers to genuine Indigenous electoral empowerment and the need for a more equitable and privacy-respecting approach to democratic participation.", "model": "gemini-2.5-flash", "generated_at": "2025-06-21T23:36:48.662157", "raw_response_path": "data/llm_responses/LS7888__per_file__left_leaning__7888-020.pdf__20250621T233648.json", "output_tokens": 327, "prompt_tokens": 1479, "total_tokens": 2903, "summary_length": 1807}, "right_leaning": {"needs_summary": true, "source_hash": "0593c4fde72624c82986b3ae70ee15a0adcaa0fa0e7b65b8734577a83b7ca39f", "text": "This \"Hot Issue\" brief reveals the Australian Electoral Commission's proactive stance in leveraging Centrelink's \"self-identified Indigeneity data\" to generate new Indigenous enrolment rate estimates.

While framed as an \"improved methodology\" showing increased Indigenous enrolment, this document confirms the AEC's active pursuit of targeted enrolment rates, indicating a deviation from its core neutral electoral function towards social engineering.

Its central purpose is to conveniently reframe the Indigenous enrolment rate, leveraging a \"new methodology\" based on Department of Human Services (i.e., Centrelink) data to achieve a dramatically inflated 76.4% estimate, a significant jump from previous figures. The document\u2019s language, emphasizing \"more robust data\" and \"overall increase,\" directly contradicts the FOI overview\u2019s revelation of internal caveats, \"courageous assumptions,\" and a Deputy Commissioner's explicit warnings against misrepresentation concerning this very data.\n\nThe brief functions as a justification for a statistically dubious approach, presenting precise-sounding \"estimates\" to create an illusion of progress. By institutionalizing this \"improved methodology\" for annual updates, the AEC appears to secure a mechanism for consistently reporting favourable figures, regardless of actual on-the-ground enrolment efficiency or outcomes (such as the mentioned meager 3.6% conversion rate from outreach efforts). The \"Consultation: Nil\" entry is particularly damning, revealing an insular, self-serving bureaucratic process that eschews transparency and external validation when presenting what is framed as a \"hot issue\" of significant public interest.

This new methodology leverages self-identified Indigeneity data from Centrelink, matched against the electoral roll.\n\nKey information provided includes:\n*   **Estimated Indigenous Enrolment Rate:** As at 30 June 2018, the estimated national Indigenous enrolment rate using this new methodology was **76.4%**.\n*   **Methodological Details:** The document explains the process of using Centrelink data, involving calculating raw enrolment rates for Centrelink clients (both Indigenous and non-Indigenous), applying an adjustment factor derived from the overall AEC enrolment rate, and then applying this factor to Indigenous and non-Indigenous Centrelink-based rates. It acknowledges that the method involves \"courageous assumptions\" and potential biases, yet is considered an \"improved approach.\"\n*   **Identification of Unenrolled:** Through the Centrelink data matching, the AEC identified **72,451 potentially unenrolled Indigenous Australians** as of mid-2018 (representing approximately 61% of the total estimated unenrolled Indigenous population at that time).\n*   **Enrolment Stimulation Outcomes:** A subsequent enrolment stimulation event in February/March 2019 resulted in the enrolment of **2,646 Indigenous Australians**, reducing the identified potentially unenrolled cohort to **69,143**.\n*   **Data Granularity:** The document includes detailed tables (Table 3 and 4) providing a breakdown of potentially unenrolled Indigenous Australians (under 65) and Indigenous Australians identified on the Centrelink file who were enrolled, presented by electoral division and state as at the 2019 close of rolls.\n*   **Limitations:** It notes difficulties in calculating reliable enrolment rates due to the lack of an Indigenous identifier on the Roll and less reliable Indigenous population estimates, and specifically highlights issues with data matching for Indigenous Australians aged 65 and over.\n\n**Relevance to FOI Request LS7888:**\n\nThis document is highly relevant to FOI request LS7888, which sought information on the AEC's new methodology for its Indigenous Electoral Participation Program (IEPP), particularly concerning its planning, implementation, and outcomes.\n\n*   **New Methodology (Planning & Implementation):** The document directly addresses the \"new methodology\" by detailing the strategic shift from the previous regression model to the Centrelink data-matching approach. It explains the core mechanics, assumptions, and improvements of this updated method, illustrating its \"planning\" (conceptual shift) and \"implementation\" (how the data is processed).\n*   **Outcomes:** It provides a key quantitative outcome of the new methodology: the significantly increased estimated Indigenous enrolment rate (76.4% by June 2018). It also details a direct outcome of leveraging this new data: the identification of a large cohort of potentially unenrolled Indigenous Australians and the results of a subsequent enrolment stimulation event (2,646 new enrolments), directly addressing the \"outcomes\" aspect of the FOI.\n*   **Indigenous Involvement/Costs/Staffing:** Consistent with the FOI overview, the document does not explicitly detail the number of Indigenous people involved in the methodology's development or its final costs and dedicated AEC staffing.", "model": "gemini-2.5-flash", "generated_at": "2025-06-21T23:59:18.350270", "source_hash": "e476903c183753f10a5742cfeb9da8ce8fd213082c76106abee638f9657135c7", "raw_response_path": "data/llm_responses/LS7888__per_file__balanced__7888-026.pdf__20250621T235918.json", "output_tokens": 757, "prompt_tokens": 5801, "total_tokens": 8137, "summary_length": 3760}, "left_leaning": {"needs_summary": true, "source_hash": "39ddce94cf6722a763b66f5c732d839570fc3350b42375a8768b968180130d03", "text": "This document, \"Analysis of Indigenous Enrolment,\" underscores critical challenges in achieving social equity and democratic accountability for First Nations peoples within Australia's electoral system.

The document reveals that previous \"statistically based\" models produced \"alarmingly low\" enrolment rates, which the AEC conveniently dismissed as \"hopefully represented a worst case picture\"\u2014a clear indicator of a desire to find more favorable numbers.\n\nSecondly, the introduction of the \"new methodology\" leveraging Centrelink data directly supports the claim of \"questionable data manipulation.\" While presented as an \"improved approach,\" the AEC itself caveats its results with \"courageous assumptions\" and states the figures should be \"regarded as indicative only.\" This self-contradictory language (claiming \"higher likelihood of robust results\" while simultaneously disclaiming reliability) is classic bureaucratic hedging, allowing the AEC to present a dramatically improved Indigenous enrolment rate (as seen in Table 2) while absolving itself of full accountability for its statistical integrity. The specific assumptions, like assuming equal bias in enrolment for Indigenous and non-Indigenous Centrelink clients, are major statistical liberties suggesting a hidden agenda to inflate numbers. The admission of \"significant matching error\" and \"quality of data input\" issues for older Indigenous Australians further underscores the inherent unreliability of the data they chose to rely upon, indicating a tolerance for flawed inputs so long as they yield a desired statistical outcome.\n\nFinally, despite the focus on these new statistical methods to *estimate* higher enrolment rates, the document reveals staggering real-world inefficiency.

This translates to an abysmal 3.6% conversion rate, unequivocally demonstrating the IEPP's demonstrably inefficient outreach on the ground. This stark disconnect between the AEC's efforts to statistically massage enrolment rates and its poor practical outcomes points to a program prioritising the appearance of progress over genuine, effective community engagement and tangible results.

Yet the resulting enrolment and turnout \nrates in particular were alarmingly low, and hopefully represented a worst case picture. \n\nAs part of the Annual Roll Integrity Review (ARIR), the person-level matching between the Roll and \nCentrelink now includes Centrelink\u2019s Indigenous indicator. However, as Centrelink customers \nrepresent only around half of the Roll, the matching (even if perfect) would be far from assigning all \nenrolments an Indigenous flag. Nevertheless, for the first time the AEC has a very large number of \nenrolled persons, over 6 million, with an explicit Indigenous status. \n\nThe enrolment rate, even for all persons regardless of indigeneity, is difficult to calculate reliably due \nto conceptual, collection and methodological differences between the Roll (numerator) and the ABS-\nbased enrolment-eligible population (denominator, \u201cEEP\u201d). In the case of the Indigenous population \n\nLS7888 Released Document No. 26Released under the Freedom of Information Act 1982\n\n\n--- Page 3 ---\n\nthese problems are magnified by having no Indigenous identifier on the Roll and less reliable \nestimates of Indigenous EEP.  \n\nHowever, matching the Roll to Centrelink data allows a more direct method of estimating the \nIndigenous enrolment rate. \n\nIt is still subject to quite courageous assumptions, but as fewer are required it likely represents an \nimproved approach. In summary: \n\n\uf0b7  For all Centrelink customers with an identified Indigenous or non-Indigenous status, \n\ncalculate the proportion on the Roll. This is the raw enrolment rate of Centrelink clients. \n\uf0b7  Calculate the ratio of the actual AEC enrolment rate versus the Centrelink-based rate, for the \nsame point in time. This is the overall factor to adjust any Centrelink-based rates to align \nwith AEC enrolment rates. \n\n\uf0b7  Apply the adjustment factor to raw Centrelink-based enrolment rates by Indigenous status \n\nto give Indigenous and non-Indigenous enrolment rates. \n\n\uf0b7  This process can be done at the State level, though results will have lower reliability. \n\nIt should be noted that while this method avoids indirectly modelling Indigenous enrolment rates via \ngeographic association, it does assume that any bias in Centrelink clients being enrolled is equal for \nIndigenous and non-Indigenous, and that there are no substantive Indigenous-status biases inherent \nin the Roll-to-Centrelink person matching. \n\nThe Centrelink client file with Indigenous indicator newly available to the AEC has presented an \nexcellent opportunity, via matching to the Roll and mark-off data, to improve estimation of \nIndigenous franchise KPIs.  \n\nWhile the results are subject to a number of non-trivial assumptions, the more direct estimation \nmethods lead to a higher likelihood of robust results. The figures should nevertheless still be \nregarded as indicative only. \n\nLS7888 Released Document No. 26Released under the Freedom of Information Act 1982\n\n\n--- Page 4 ---\n\nCentrelink Data \nThe number of Indigenous Australians that are identified both on the Centrelink file sent to the AEC \nin July 2018 and the electoral Roll does not represent all Indigenous enrolments. It is limited to those \nIndigenous Australians who both receive a Centrelink benefit and who have self-identified as \nIndigenous to Centrelink. \n\nAfter considerable data cleansing and analysis the AEC identified 72,451 potentially unenrolled \nIndigenous Australians. This represents around 61 per cent of the 118,581 Indigenous Australians \nthe AEC estimate were unenrolled as at 30 June 2018 (see table 2 above).  \n\nThe enrolment stimulation event conducted in February/March 2019 resulted in the enrolment of \n2,646 Indigenous Australians, reducing the estimated number of unenrolled Indigenous Australians \nidentified in the Centrelink dataset to 69,143. Table 3 sets out the distribution of this cohort across \nelectoral divisions.  \n\nIt is important to note that the potential unenrolled under 65 Indigenous Australians as at the 2019 \nclose of rolls represents those people that are on the Centrelink file sent to the AEC in July 2018 and \nwho were included in the February 2019 enrolment stimulation event but had not enrolled as at the \n2019 close of rolls (18 April 2019).  \n\nAnalysis of the Centrelink potentially unenrolled Indigenous Australians 65 years and older identified \nsignificant matching error, due to the quality of data input and the nature of the residential status of \nthis cohort.

Summary\n\nThis document is an email chain from August 2019 among senior Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) staff, including the Deputy Electoral Commissioner, Assistant Commissioner, and directors/assistant directors of the Roll Management & Community Engagement Branch. The correspondence centers on the preparation and refinement of an \"Indigenous data\" report (\"Indigenous population statistics\") for presentation to Australian Government Ministers (Assistant Minister, Finance Minister).\n\nKey points from the document include:\n*   **Data Content:** The report compiles various Indigenous electoral statistics, including:\n    *   Published estimated Indigenous enrolment rates based on self-identified Indigenous people from Centrelink data compared to the Electoral Roll (Table 1).\n    *   Divisional and state breakdowns of approximately 72,000 Indigenous people identified from Centrelink data (June 2018) who were contacted as part of a \"Feb stimulation event\" (Tables 2 & 3). This data was cleansed to remove certain groups (e.g., over 65s, those already on the roll).\n    *   Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) estimated Indigenous population (over 18 years old) (Table 4).\n*   **Methodology and Caveats:** Senior staff emphasize the need to explicitly state the methodology used and stress that the data is \"based on estimates on top of estimates\" and \"cannot be considered 100% accurate\" due to the nature and quality of the underlying data (Centrelink data quality issues, further breakdown leading to greater error risk).\n*   **Ministerial Interest:** There is high-level ministerial interest in this data, with requests from both the Assistant Minister and the Finance Minister's Office.\n*   **Ongoing Work:** The AEC was actively working on incorporating the latest June 2019 Centrelink data with their Business Intelligence, Research and Electoral Integrity (BIREI) unit to increase confidence in their estimates.\n\n### Relevance to FOI Request LS7888\n\nThis document is highly relevant to FOI request LS7888 as it provides direct insight into the AEC's new methodology for its Indigenous Electoral Participation Program (IEPP) and associated data.\n*   **New Methodology & Data Use:** The document explicitly confirms the AEC's reliance on \"self-identified Indigenous people on Centrelink data\" to estimate Indigenous enrolment rates and identify potentially unenrolled Indigenous Australians. This directly aligns with the FOI request's overview stating the AEC's transition to a more direct method using Centrelink data.\n*   **Implementation & Outcomes:** The discussion of the \"Feb stimulation event\" where ~72,000 Indigenous people were identified and contacted for enrolment stimulation demonstrates a concrete implementation activity and its associated outcomes (e.g., numbers identified). The document details how the outcomes of the new methodology (estimated enrolment rates, figures of unenrolled Indigenous Australians) are being tracked and communicated internally and to ministers.\n*   **Planning & Refinement:** The email chain illustrates the internal planning and refinement process for communicating the results of the new methodology, including the critical discussion around presenting the data with appropriate caveats regarding its estimation basis.\n*   **Consistency with FOI Findings:** The mention of \"over 72,000 potentially unenrolled Indigenous Australians\" in mid-2018 (or identified from June 2018 data) directly supports and adds detail to the FOI overview's finding about identifying such a group.\n*   **Gaps in FOI Request:** The document, consistent with the FOI request's noted gaps, does not explicitly detail the number of Indigenous people involved in the methodology's development or its final costs and dedicated AEC staffing.", "model": "gemini-2.5-flash", "generated_at": "2025-06-21T23:59:32.039220", "source_hash": "b8a07c0d7bb60a450f51cdc838c21005ebe67a6f04794bfab56c5c0d7fdba367", "raw_response_path": "data/llm_responses/LS7888__per_file__balanced__7888-028.pdf__20250621T235932.json", "output_tokens": 765, "prompt_tokens": 5190, "total_tokens": 7363, "summary_length": 3797}, "left_leaning": {"needs_summary": true, "source_hash": "fb24094d37d984479d31b417082b7780b483cd7af73ac4d6c5dddf9225348de8", "text": "This internal AEC email chain confirms the agency's reliance on \"estimates on top of estimates,\" primarily derived from \"self-identified Indigenous people on Centrelink data,\" to gauge Indigenous electoral enrolment for ministerial briefings. From a left-leaning perspective, this document underscores a critical systemic failing in democratic accountability: the explicit acknowledgement that this data \"is not and cannot be considered 100% accurate\" highlights the continued absence of a direct Indigenous identifier on the federal roll. This forces the AEC to use highly caveated, \"indicative only\" data, severely limiting its ability to achieve genuine social equity in electoral participation.\n\nThe extensive use of sensitive Centrelink data, specifically noted for a \"stimulation event\" (an enrolment drive), confirms the blurring of lines between social support and civic duties, raising significant civil liberties and privacy concerns. It reveals a bureaucratic approach that leverages personal welfare information for electoral purposes, rather than fostering trust and engagement through community-led initiatives. Crucially, the detailed internal discussions about data preparation and reconciliation for ministerial briefings reveal no Indigenous involvement in the planning, analysis, or design of these statistical efforts. This absence of co-design and self-determination is a significant progressive shortcoming, reinforcing a top-down approach to Indigenous electoral participation rather than a truly equitable and community-driven one.", "model": "gemini-2.5-flash", "generated_at": "2025-06-21T23:37:11.124374", "raw_response_path": "data/llm_responses/LS7888__per_file__left_leaning__7888-028.pdf__20250621T233711.json", "output_tokens": 262, "prompt_tokens": 5256, "total_tokens": 6665, "summary_length": 1555}, "right_leaning": {"needs_summary": true, "source_hash": "fb24094d37d984479d31b417082b7780b483cd7af73ac4d6c5dddf9225348de8", "text": "This document highlights the Australian Electoral Commission's deep immersion in collecting and refining 'Indigenous population statistics' for high-level ministerial briefings, further exposing concerns about government overreach and fiscal accountability. The correspondence explicitly reveals the AEC's reliance on 'self-identified Indigenous people on Centrelink data' to cross-reference with the electoral roll, confirming the use of a de facto administrative identifier that directly infringes on individual privacy and expands government reach beyond its core electoral function. Of particular concern is the acknowledged unreliability of this data, with senior officials like Jeff Pope explicitly stating the need to 'emphasise that this data is based on estimates on top of estimates so they clearly understand that this data is not and cannot be considered 100% accurate,' and warning of a 'greater risk of error' the more it is broken down. This internal admission of significant 'quality issues' with the Centrelink data underscores profound questions about the efficacy and responsible allocation of taxpayer funds for 'enrolment stimulation events' built upon such flawed methodologies. The intense focus from the Finance Minister\u2019s Office on this inherently imprecise data further reveals a government actively engaged in demographic targeting and social engineering, rather than upholding a neutral and limited role in electoral administration. The need for explicit caveats to be embedded in reports for ministers also suggests a controlled narrative, potentially obscuring the program\u2019s inherent inaccuracies from public scrutiny.", "model": "gemini-2.5-flash", "generated_at": "2025-06-21T23:40:44.119237", "raw_response_path": "data/llm_responses/LS7888__per_file__right_leaning__7888-028.pdf__20250621T234044.json", "output_tokens": 279, "prompt_tokens": 5273, "total_tokens": 7279, "summary_length": 1648}, "government_skeptic": {"needs_summary": true, "source_hash": "fb24094d37d984479d31b417082b7780b483cd7af73ac4d6c5dddf9225348de8", "text": "This document, an internal email chain regarding \"Indigenous population statistics,\" strongly reinforces a skeptic's view of bureaucratic processes focused on perception management rather than genuine transparency or accuracy.\n\n1.  **Bureaucracy and Perception Management:** The urgent, high-pressure requests to prepare data for \"Minister's Office\" and \"Assistant Minister's visit\" within days, even hours, highlight a reactive, Ministerial-driven process. Deputy Electoral Commissioner Jeff Pope's insistence on embedding caveats, explicitly stating he doesn't want the \"critical context\" (i.e., data limitations) to be \"lost over time,\" reveals a clear intent to control how this \"excellent and extremely valuable\" data is received by political stakeholders, rather than a focus on robust public reporting.\n2.  **Questionable Data Integrity and Lack of Accountability:** The candid internal admissions are highly incriminating. Jeff Pope himself states the data is \"based on estimates on top of estimates\" and \"cannot be considered 100% accurate,\" directly supporting the FOI overview's claim of \"courageous assumptions\" and statistically dubious approaches. Assistant Commissioner Robyn Legg confirms the data relies on \"assumptions,\" notes \"quality issues\" with the Centrelink data (the foundation of the AEC's \"new methodology\"), and explicitly states that more detailed breakdowns \"wouldn\u2019t feel comfortable sharing\" externally due to a \"greater risk of error.\" Yet, this internally acknowledged unreliable data is being prepared for Ministers. This stark internal/external data dichotomy points to a deliberate lack of public accountability, where the AEC prioritizes presenting a managed, positive narrative to Ministers (and by extension, the public) while internally acknowledging significant data flaws.\n3.  **Hidden Agendas (Masking Inefficiency):** The drive to produce \"excellent and extremely valuable\" Indigenous enrolment data, despite its acknowledged unreliability, suggests an agenda to justify program effectiveness or secure continued funding without demonstrating substantive, verifiable outcomes. The concern over a \"slight discrepancy... of about 700 electors\" that \"will be quickly picked up by the advisors\" further highlights a focus on surface-level precision for Ministerial review rather than fundamental data integrity. The entire exchange, marked \"For-Official-Use-Only,\" underscores an institutional reluctance to openly share the true limitations of its \"Indigenous population statistics,\" potentially obscuring the true efficiency and effectiveness of the IEPP.", "model": "gemini-2.5-flash", "generated_at": "2025-06-21T23:44:46.508875", "raw_response_path":

This new approach, implemented since 2017, leverages Centrelink client files that include a self-identified Indigenous indicator. By matching these Centrelink records to the electoral roll, the AEC can more accurately estimate Indigenous enrolment rates.\n\nKey findings and details presented:\n*   **New Methodology:** The AEC's \"current method\" involves person-level matching between the electoral roll and Centrelink data, including Centrelink's Indigenous indicator. An adjustment factor is applied to raw Centrelink-based enrolment rates to align them with overall AEC enrolment rates.\n*   **Estimated Enrolment Rates:** As of 30 June 2018, the estimated national Indigenous enrolment rate using this new methodology was **76.4%**. State-level breakdowns are also provided.\n*   **Enrolment Stimulation:** Through data cleansing and analysis of the Centrelink file, the AEC identified **72,451 potentially unenrolled Indigenous Australians** (under 65) as of mid-2018.\n*   **Outcomes of Stimulation:** An enrolment stimulation event conducted in February/March 2019, using the 2018 Centrelink data, resulted in the enrolment of **2,646 individuals** who indicated they were Indigenous. This reduced the identified unenrolled cohort to 69,143.\n*   **Data Limitations:** The document acknowledges that Centrelink data represents only about half of the total electoral roll and is limited to Indigenous Australians receiving Centrelink benefits who have self-identified. It also notes issues with matching data for Indigenous Australians aged 65 and over.\n*   **Detailed Breakdown:** Tables provide granular data on enrolled and potentially unenrolled Indigenous Australians by state and electoral division.\n\n**Relevance to FOI Request LS7888:**\nThis document is highly relevant to FOI request LS7888 as it directly addresses:\n*   **New Methodology:** It provides comprehensive details on the AEC's new methodology for its Indigenous Electoral Participation Program (IEPP), specifically its reliance on Centrelink's self-identified Indigenous data.\n*   **Planning and Implementation:** It describes the transition from the old method, the integration of Centrelink data into the Annual Roll Integrity Review (ARIR), and the execution of the enrolment stimulation event.\n*   **Outcomes:** It presents key outcomes such as the increased estimated Indigenous enrolment rate (76.4% by June 2018), the identification of potentially unenrolled Indigenous Australians, and the number of new enrolments resulting from the stimulation event.\n\nConsistent with the FOI overview, the document does not explicitly detail the number of Indigenous people involved in the methodology's development or its final costs and dedicated AEC staffing. However, it significantly clarifies the technical planning, implementation, and initial outcomes of the new IEPP methodology.", "model": "gemini-2.5-flash", "generated_at": "2025-06-21T23:59:44.579681", "source_hash": "fd210862242610146f16e4ce933bdb925170e45beeba60a4550f69f92a24dc54", "raw_response_path": "data/llm_responses/LS7888__per_file__balanced__7888-029.pdf__20250621T235944.json", "output_tokens": 672, "prompt_tokens": 6087, "total_tokens": 8326, "summary_length": 3238}, "left_leaning": {"needs_summary": true, "source_hash": "ff8811e5e354f6551ed5e84c745856dabc123052c51c5125fb70c5dca0bb57ff", "text": "This document, \"Analysis of Indigenous Enrolment,\" starkly illustrates a core systemic failing within Australia's electoral system that impedes genuine democratic accountability and social equity for Indigenous Australians. It explicitly confirms that the **absence of a direct Indigenous identifier on the federal electoral roll** necessitates reliance on complex, indirect, and acknowledged \"indicative only\" estimation methods. This fundamental lack of a direct identifier makes accurate measurement of Indigenous electoral participation inherently problematic and undermines efforts towards \"Closing the Gap.\"\n\nFrom a left-leaning perspective, the document's extensive reliance on **sensitive Centrelink client data** to estimate Indigenous enrolment rates and identify unenrolled individuals raises significant civil liberties concerns. While presented as an \"excellent opportunity\" by the AEC, this approach blurs the lines between social support and civic duties, disproportionately targeting and identifying Indigenous Australians who are already engaged with social welfare systems. The fact that Centrelink data represents only about half the overall electoral roll means this method inherently focuses enrolment efforts on a specific, often more vulnerable, segment of the Indigenous population, rather than implementing universal and rights-based enrolment strategies.\n\nFurthermore, the document's detailed technical analysis of data matching and statistical assumptions highlights the *AEC's internal processes* without any mention of **Indigenous involvement in the planning or design of these critical analytical methods**. This absence reinforces the broader critique that the Indigenous Electoral Participation Program (IEPP) lacks principles of self-determination and co-design, crucial for genuinely equitable and effective initiatives. Issues identified within the document, such as \"significant matching error\" for Indigenous Australians aged 65 and over due to \"quality of data input and the nature of the residential status of this cohort,\" underscore systemic data handling deficiencies that can further disadvantage older Indigenous people and hinder their democratic participation.\n\nIn essence, while the document reveals the AEC's efforts to measure Indigenous enrolment disparities, the methodologies detailed expose the persistent structural barriers, privacy concerns, and a concerning lack of Indigenous self-determination in addressing foundational issues of democratic participation and social equity.", "model": "gemini-2.5-flash", "generated_at": "2025-06-21T23:37:24.092757", "raw_response_path": "data/llm_responses/LS7888__per_file__left_leaning__7888-029.pdf__20250621T233724.json", "output_tokens": 410, "prompt_tokens": 6019, "total_tokens": 7727, "summary_length": 2534}, "right_leaning": {"needs_summary": true, "source_hash": "ff8811e5e354f6551ed5e84c745856dabc123052c51c5125fb70c5dca0bb57ff", "text": "This document, \"Analysis of Indigenous Enrolment,\" directly substantiates significant concerns about government overreach, individual privacy, and the Australian Electoral Commission's deviation from its core function.

These caveats undermine any claims of robustness or accuracy, yet the \"improved\" (and higher) figures are still presented as a key outcome.\n*   **Persistent Data Integrity Issues:** The document highlights that the federal electoral roll lacks an Indigenous identifier, a fundamental obstacle the AEC attempts to circumvent with complex, imperfect matching processes. Furthermore, it admits \"significant matching error, due to the quality of data input\" for older Indigenous Australians, demonstrating inherent flaws in their data. Despite these known limitations and the acknowledgement that Centrelink data represents only about half the overall roll, the AEC proceeds with this as its \"improved\" approach, deferring resolution of data quality issues to future \"work.\"\n*   **Gross Inefficiency Masked by Data Activity:** Despite the elaborate \"data cleansing and analysis\" that identified 72,451 \"potentially unenrolled Indigenous Australians,\" a subsequent \"enrolment stimulation event\" using this targeted list only resulted in 2,646 enrolments.

Yet the resulting enrolment and turnout \nrates in particular were alarmingly low, and hopefully represented a worst case picture. \n\nCurrent method \n\nThe Centrelink client file with Indigenous indicator available to the AEC annually since 2017 has \npresented an excellent opportunity, via matching to the Roll and mark-off data, to improve \nestimation of Indigenous franchise KPIs.  \n\nWhile the results are subject to a number of non-trivial assumptions, the more direct estimation \nmethods lead to a higher likelihood of robust results. The figures should nevertheless still be \nregarded as indicative only. \n\nAs part of the Annual Roll Integrity Review (ARIR), the person-level matching between the Roll and \nCentrelink now includes Centrelink\u2019s Indigenous indicator. However, as Centrelink customers \nrepresent only around half of the Roll, the matching (even if perfect) would be far from assigning all \nenrolments an Indigenous flag. Nevertheless, for the first time the AEC has a very large number of \nenrolled persons, over 6 million, matched to Centrelink records with an explicit Indigenous status. \n\nThe enrolment rate, even for all persons regardless of indigeneity, is difficult to calculate reliably \ndue to conceptual, collection and methodological differences between the Roll (numerator) and the \nABS-based enrolment-eligible population (denominator, \u201cEEP\u201d). In the case of the Indigenous \npopulation these problems are magnified by having no Indigenous identifier on the Roll and less \nreliable estimates of Indigenous EEP.  \n\nHowever, matching the Roll to Centrelink data allows a more direct method of estimating the \nIndigenous enrolment rate.

It is limited to \nthose Indigenous Australians who both receive a Centrelink benefit and who have self-identified as \nIndigenous to Centrelink. \n\nAfter considerable data cleansing and analysis the AEC identified 72,451 potentially unenrolled \nIndigenous Australians. This represents around 61 per cent of the 118,581 Indigenous Australians \nthe AEC estimate were not enrolled as at 30 June 2018 (see Table 2 above). \n\nThe enrolment stimulation event conducted in February/March 2019 using 2018 Centrelink data \nresulted in the enrolment of 2,646 people who indicated they were Indigenous. This reduced the \nestimated number of unenrolled Indigenous Australians identified in the Centrelink dataset to \n69,143. Table 3 sets out the distribution of this cohort across states and Table 4 provides the data \nfor electoral divisions. \n\nIt is important to note that the potential unenrolled under 65 Indigenous Australians as at the 2019 \nclose of rolls represents those people that are on the Centrelink file sent to the AEC in July 2018 \nand who were included in the February 2019 enrolment stimulation event but had not enrolled as at \nthe 2019 close of rolls (18 April 2019). \n\nAnalysis of the Centrelink potentially unenrolled Indigenous Australians 65 years and older \nidentified significant matching error, due to the quality of data input and the nature of the residential \nstatus of this cohort.

It highlights the challenge of tracking Indigenous enrolment due to the absence of a specific identifier on the electoral roll.\n\nThe document explains the transition from an \"indirect estimation\" method (a regression model from 2014 that yielded \"alarmingly low\" and unreliable rates) to a \"more direct method\" developed in 2017. This new approach leverages person-level Centrelink data, specifically the Indigenous indicator included in Centrelink extracts. Although Centrelink data covers only about half of the electoral roll, it allows the AEC to directly associate Indigenous status with over 6 million enrolled persons for the first time.\n\nThe new methodology for calculating the Indigenous enrolment rate involves:\n1.  Calculating the raw enrolment rate for Centrelink clients (Indigenous and non-Indigenous) who are on the electoral roll.\n2.  Deriving an overall adjustment factor by comparing the actual AEC enrolment rate for all persons with the Centrelink-based rate.\n3.  Applying this adjustment factor to the raw Centrelink-based Indigenous and non-Indigenous enrolment rates to produce adjusted, indicative estimates.\n\nWhile acknowledging that the results are based on \"courageous assumptions\" and should be considered \"indicative only,\" the document concludes that this Centrelink-based method offers a \"higher likelihood of robust results\" compared to the previous model.

Having these key franchise KPIs for the \n\nIndigenous population is important for Closing the Gap purposes and the AECs focus on how the franchise \ncould be better delivered. \n\nIn 2014 the AEC\u2019s Research Section commenced indirect estimation of these figures, using a regression model \nof the relationship between the Indigenous population and each of the three franchise KPIs at a small area \nlevel, such as polling place catchment or the ABS\u2019 SA2 geography. While the models did not fit the data \nparticularly well, the resulting Indigenous enrolment, \nreal data, rather than anecdote. Yet the resulting enrolment and turnout rates in particular were alarmingly \nlow, and hopefully represented a worst case picture. \n\n rates were statistically based on \n\nCentrelink Data \nAround the same time, the Research Section informally proposed that person-level Centrelink extracts that the \nAEC received occasionally for other Roll validation work, could perhaps be extended to include Centrelink\u2019s \nIndigenous indicator. This came to fruition in 20171. \n\nAs part of the Annual Roll Integrity Review (ARIR), the person-level matching between the Roll and Centrelink \nnow included Centrelink\u2019s Indigenous indicator. However as Centrelink customers represent only around half \nof the Roll, the matching (even if perfect) would be far from assigning all enrolments an Indigenous flag. \nNevertheless, for the first time the AEC has a very large number of enrolled persons, over 6 million, with an \nexplicit Indigenous status. \n\nEnrolment Rate\n\n1.\nThe enrolment rate, even for all persons regardless of indigeneity, is difficult to calculate reliably due to \nconceptual, collection and methodological differences between the Roll (numerator) and the ABS-based \nenrolment-eligible population (denominator, \u201cEEP\u201d). In the case of the Indigenous population these problems \nare magnified by having no Indigenous identifier on the Roll and less reliable estimates of Indigenous EEP.  \n\nHowever, matching the Roll to Centrelink data allows a more direct method of estimating the Indigenous \nenrolment rate. It is still subject to quite courageous assumptions, but as fewer are required it likely \nrepresents an improved approach. In summary: \n\n\uf0b7\n\n\uf0b7\n\n\uf0b7\n\n\uf0b7\n\nFor all Centrelink customers with an identified Indigenous or non-Indigenous status, calculate the\nproportion on the Roll. This is the raw enrolment rate of Centrelink clients.\nCalculate the ratio of the actual AEC enrolment rate versus the Centrelink-based rate, for the same\npoint in time. This is the overall factor to adjust any Centrelink-based rates to align with AEC\nenrolment rates.\nApply the adjustment factor to raw Centrelink-based enrolment rates by Indigenous status to give\nIndigenous and non-Indigenous enrolment rates.\nThis process can be done at the State level, though results will have lower reliability.\n\nNOTE: While this method avoids indirectly modelling Indigenous enrolment rates via geographic \nassociation, it does assume that any bias in Centrelink clients being enrolled is equal for \nIndigenous and non-Indigenous, and that there are no substantive Indigenous-status biases \ninherent in the Roll-to-Centrelink person matching. \n\n1 Acknowledge with appreciation the work of the former Electoral Integrity Unit and the IT Branch. \n\nLS7888 Released Document No. 301919Released under the Freedom of Information Act 1982\n\n\n--- Page 2 ---\n\nConclusion and Results \nThe Centrelink client file with Indigenous indicator newly available to the AEC has presented an excellent \nopportunity, via matching to the Roll and mark-off data, to improve estimation of Indigenous franchise KPIs.  \n\nWhile the results are subject to a number of non-trivial assumptions, the more direct estimation methods lead \nto a higher likelihood of robust results.

Key points include:\n\n*   **National Trends:** The national Indigenous enrolment rate saw a small increase from 76.4% in 2018 to 76.6% in 2019, continuing an upward trend from 74.7% in 2017. While the estimated number of enrolled Indigenous people grew by 3%, the estimated unenrolled Indigenous population also increased by 1.6% (from 118,581 to 120,486), which was noted as \"unfavourable\" compared to the previous year's decrease.\n*   **State-level Analysis:**\n    *   **NSW:** Experienced a slight decrease in its Indigenous enrolment rate from 87.3% (2018) to 86.2% (2019). Despite this small percentage drop, the estimated unenrolled NSW Indigenous population significantly increased by 10.9% (from 20,954 to 23,239), due to the large overall eligible population in the state. This increase in unenrolled numbers was a point of internal discussion, noting the need to be prepared to explain it.\n    *   **NT, WA, QLD:** All showed small increases in their Indigenous enrolment rates, continuing upward trends from 2017. The NT and WA saw marginal decreases in their estimated unenrolled Indigenous populations. (Detailed QLD unenrolled figures are not fully present in the provided snippet but are implied in the discussion).\n*   **Internal Discussion:** The emails show AEC staff analyzing the data, particularly the \"outlier\" trend in NSW, and preparing documentation (minutes, speaking notes, QTB) for reporting on these figures.\n\n## Relevance to FOI Request LS7888\n\nThis document is highly relevant to FOI request LS7888, which sought information on the AEC's new Indigenous Electoral Participation Program (IEPP) methodology, specifically its planning, implementation, and outcomes for 2018-2019.\n\n*   **Outcomes:** The document directly addresses the \"outcomes\" aspect of the FOI request by providing precise Indigenous enrolment rates and detailed statistics on enrolled and unenrolled populations for 2018 and 2019, both nationally and for key states (NSW, NT, WA, QLD). These figures corroborate the overall national rate increases cited in the FOI request overview (76.4% by June 2018 and 76.6% by June 2019), demonstrating the tangible results of the new methodology.\n*   **Implementation/Impact:** By presenting the actual enrolment rates derived from the AEC's ongoing data collection (presumably using the Centrelink data-driven methodology), the document illustrates the impact and ongoing implementation of the new approach during the specified timeframe.\n*   **Planning:** The email exchange demonstrates internal AEC analysis and \"paper work\" preparation related to reporting on these outcomes, indicating ongoing planning and management of the IEPP and its metrics.\n*   **Limitations:** Consistent with the FOI overview, the document does not explicitly detail the number of Indigenous people involved in the methodology's development or its final costs and dedicated AEC staffing.", "model": "gemini-2.5-flash", "generated_at": "2025-06-22T00:00:12.441333", "source_hash": "a92dd410c70007b25c3af98abecbbd892d5bfdd336332a51459d09c04a36b579", "raw_response_path": "data/llm_responses/LS7888__per_file__balanced__7888-032.pdf__20250622T000012.json", "output_tokens": 740, "prompt_tokens": 4354, "total_tokens": 6606, "summary_length": 3143}, "left_leaning": {"needs_summary": true, "source_hash": "d9d80b0781920907c8b338f59aa4b1d89d473deb097f90ea9d0dc660d25bf4b1", "text": "The internal AEC email chain, a document released under FOI, highlights a concerning backslide in Indigenous electoral participation, particularly in New South Wales. While national Indigenous enrolment rates saw only a marginal increase, the estimated unenrolled Indigenous population *grew* by 1.6% nationally. More significantly, in NSW, the estimated unenrolled Indigenous population spiked by a substantial 10.9% (2,285 individuals) in a single year, identified by AEC staff as an \"outlier.\"\n\nFrom a left-leaning perspective, this document underscores critical implications for social equity and democratic accountability. The rising number of unenrolled Indigenous Australians, particularly in a key state, demonstrates a failure to effectively address systemic barriers to participation and truly \"Close the Gap.\" This outcome is exacerbated by the AEC's continued reliance on \"estimated\" Indigenous enrolment figures, as explicitly noted in the broader FOI overview. The absence of a direct Indigenous identifier on the federal roll means programs like the IEPP operate on imprecise data, inherently limiting their ability to achieve genuine equity and responsiveness. This data deficiency, combined with the observed setback in NSW, reinforces the critique that without authentic self-determination and co-design principles \u2013 meaning Indigenous voices guiding the program's planning and implementation \u2013 efforts remain insufficient and can even see regressive results in vital areas of democratic participation.", "model": "gemini-2.5-flash", "generated_at": "2025-06-21T23:37:42.452229", "raw_response_path": "data/llm_responses/LS7888__per_file__left_leaning__7888-032.pdf__20250621T233742.json", "output_tokens": 273, "prompt_tokens": 4289, "total_tokens": 6182, "summary_length": 1520}, "right_leaning": {"needs_summary": true, "source_hash": "d9d80b0781920907c8b338f59aa4b1d89d473deb097f90ea9d0dc660d25bf4b1", "text": "This document, detailing the Australian Electoral Commission's internal analysis of Indigenous enrolment rates, underscores critical concerns from a right-leaning perspective regarding government overreach and fiscal responsibility within the context of the Indigenous Electoral Participation Program. The AEC's granular focus on specific demographic enrolment figures, exemplified by the detailed dissection of a minor percentage drop in NSW (87% to 86%) translating to a significant 10.9% *increase* in the estimated unenrolled Indigenous population in that state, highlights an intense, identity-driven administrative pursuit that extends beyond the neutral application of electoral law.\n\nThis active monitoring and internal concern over fluctuating, ethnicity-specific enrolment rates reinforce the argument of government overreach, as the AEC appears to be engaging in a form of social engineering under the \"Closing the Gap\" mandate, rather than simply facilitating universal enrolment. The fact that the estimated national unenrolled Indigenous population *grew* by 1.6% (from 118,581 to 120,486) despite the program's reforms raises serious questions about the efficacy and financial accountability of taxpayer funds allocated to \"enrolment stimulation events\" and new methodologies. If the unenrolled population is increasing in key states like NSW, it suggests inefficiency in government spending and a lack of tangible return on investment. Furthermore, the discussion of \"estimation error\" and the complex mathematical explanations for shifts in unenrolled numbers implicitly points to the \"courageous assumptions\" and potential imprecision of the methodology, further questioning the reliability of such targeted, government-driven interventions.", "model": "gemini-2.5-flash", "generated_at": "2025-06-21T23:41:19.625354", "raw_response_path": "data/llm_responses/LS7888__per_file__right_leaning__7888-032.pdf__20250621T234119.json", "output_tokens": 321, "prompt_tokens": 4306, "total_tokens": 5981, "summary_length": 1759}, "government_skeptic": {"needs_summary": true, "source_hash": "d9d80b0781920907c8b338f59aa4b1d89d473deb097f90ea9d0dc660d25bf4b1", "text": "This document, an email chain from September 2019, starkly illustrates the AEC's bureaucratic focus on managing perception and deflecting accountability regarding Indigenous enrolment.\n\n**Bureaucracy:** The internal discussion immediately highlights a preoccupation with \"preparing the paper work (Minute, speaking notes, QTB, draft letters etc.)\" before publicly releasing enrolment rates. This signals a heavy emphasis on internal messaging and pre-empting external questions, rather than a raw, transparent assessment of program effectiveness. The concern from Director Sean Ferrari about the 10.9% increase in unenrolled Indigenous people in NSW is not about operational failure, but about needing to \"be prepared to answer the question,\" underscoring a reactive, defensive bureaucratic mindset focused on damage control.\n\n**Lack of Accountability:** When confronted with a significant 10.9% increase in the unenrolled Indigenous population in NSW\u2014an \"outlier\" and \"big increase\"\u2014the response from Angelo Rojas is to immediately downplay it. He labels the corresponding 1 percentage point decrease in the enrolment rate as \"not statistically significant\" and falling within \"estimation error.\" While providing a detailed statistical explanation that attributes the large absolute increase to NSW's size, there is no discussion of *why* this increase occurred operationally, nor any proposed changes to address it. This mathematical deflection effectively dismisses a concerning negative trend, allowing the AEC to avoid deeper inquiry into its own program's efficacy and accountability for declining enrolment in a key state.\n\n**Hidden Agendas (Managing Perception):** The entire exchange serves to rationalize potentially negative statistics. The framing of a minimal national increase as \"not really significant but better than a reduction\" and the detailed statistical explanation for the NSW outlier appear crafted to minimize concern. This aligns with the broader FOI overview's assertion that the AEC's activities are \"primarily focused on managing perception and obscuring true costs rather than achieving substantive outcomes for Indigenous enrolment.\" The document demonstrates an internal mechanism for spinning data and providing pre-packaged answers to maintain an appearance of control, even in the face of concerning

"/extracted_texts/LS7888_7888-037.txt", "ai_summaries": {"balanced": {"text": "### Summary of Document LS7888 Released Document No. 377\n\nThis document consists of an email exchange from late August to early September 2019 between various AEC staff members (Tita Tabije, Angelo Rojas, Gus Verzosa, Guy Lewis, Andrew Trainer, Sean Ferrari, Sam Hannan-Morrow) from the Business Intelligence, Research & Electoral Integrity (BIREI) and Roll Management & Community Engagement (RMCE) sections. The correspondence centers on the review and finalisation of \"Indigenous KPI\" results, specifically the estimated Indigenous electoral enrolment rates for 30 June 2019.\n\nThe emails reveal an internal process of data validation and refinement, including the identification and correction of an issue that made the comparison between 2018 and 2019 numbers appear \"strange.\" Staff confirm that the revised figures are satisfactory and ready for endorsement by the Executive Leadership Team (ELT). A key detail is the reference to a working file path, `T:\\Strategic Capability\\Strategic Research & Analysis\\Research\\Polling Places\\IEPP & other requests\\KPIs\\Using 2016 Census Data & Methods\\ARIR-Centrelink\\Indigenous Enrolment Rate 2019 BENCHMARKED.xlsb`, which explicitly links the calculations to the Indigenous Electoral Participation Program (IEPP) and indicates the use of Centrelink data (`ARIR-Centrelink`) in conjunction with 2016 Census data for Key Performance Indicators (KPIs).\n\nThe document includes two tables presenting the finalised data:\n1.  **Indigenous Status Enrolment Rates, 30 June 2019:** This table provides detailed figures by state and nationally for both Indigenous and Non-Indigenous populations. Key national figures for Indigenous Australians are:\n    *   Estimated voting age population: 515,019\n    *   Estimated enrolled: 391,418\n    *   Estimated 'missing' (unenrolled): 123,601\n    *   Enrolment Rate: 76%\n2.  **Differences between 30 June 2019 and 30 June 2018:** This table shows the changes in estimated populations, enrolments, and enrolment rates over the preceding year. Nationally, the estimated 'missing' Indigenous population decreased by 5,020 between June 2018 and June 2019.\n\n### Relevance to FOI Request LS7888\n\nThis document is highly relevant to FOI request LS7888, which sought information on the AEC's new methodology for its Indigenous Electoral Participation Program (IEPP) concerning its planning, implementation, and outcomes during 2018-2019:\n\n*   **New Methodology (Implementation & Refinement):** The email exchange and the referenced file path clearly demonstrate the ongoing implementation and internal review of the new methodology for calculating Indigenous enrolment rates. The explicit mention of `ARIR-Centrelink` data and `2016 Census Data & Methods` directly confirms the application of the Centrelink-based approach for IEPP KPIs. The discussion about addressing data discrepancies between 2018 and 2019 highlights the meticulous refinement efforts within the methodology.\n*   **Outcomes:** The attached tables provide concrete outcomes of the new methodology. Specifically, they present the national estimated Indigenous enrolment rate of 76% as of June 2019, which closely aligns with the FOI overview's stated outcome (76.6% for June 2019). The document also details the estimated number of unenrolled Indigenous Australians (\"the missing\") as 123,601 for June 2019 and indicates a reduction of 5,020 in this figure compared to June 2018, implying positive progress in enrolment efforts or data accuracy.\n*   **Timeline:** The document's dates (late August to early September 2019) and the data it presents (as of 30 June 2019) fall squarely within the 2018-2019 timeframe specified by the FOI request.\n\nWhile highly relevant to the methodology's implementation and outcomes, the document does not explicitly detail the number of Indigenous people involved in the methodology's development or its final costs and dedicated AEC staffing, as noted as gaps in the FOI overview.", "model": "gemini-2.5-flash", "generated_at": "2025-06-22T00:00:35.125113", "source_hash": "d4cb9f28f9d99def3db067c6c3c88dacde2f9cbd2ee31bc2a18894cd500e47a9", "raw_response_path": "data/llm_responses/LS7888__per_file__balanced__7888-037.pdf__20250622T000035.json", "output_tokens": 935, "prompt_tokens": 5108, "total_tokens": 9476, "summary_length": 3952}, "left_leaning": {"needs_summary": true, "source_hash": "426de3294e410be5d20c0f0719993acf9a150e678235185b21e4164f6bcef0d9", "text": "This document, an internal email exchange concerning the Australian Electoral Commission's (AEC) Indigenous KPI and enrolment rates, starkly illustrates the systemic shortcomings within the Indigenous Electoral Participation Program (IEPP) from a left-leaning perspective. While it shows the AEC\u2019s continued efforts to track and improve Indigenous enrolment, as evidenced by the calculation of \"ATSI enrolment rates\" and the attempt to reduce the number of \"missing\" Indigenous voters (down by 5,020 nationally), these efforts remain deeply problematic for social equity and democratic accountability.\n\nCrucially, the document highlights the ongoing reliance on \"estimated\" Indigenous data, explicitly mentioning \"ARIR-Centrelink\" methods. This reinforces the fundamental failing of the absence of a direct Indigenous identifier on the federal roll, meaning the AEC is forced to use indirect, \"indicative only\" data. This perpetuates a lack of true self-determination, as Indigenous Australians are not directly identified on their own electoral status.\n\nFurthermore, the internal nature of the discussion \u2013 focused on correcting data discrepancies, reviewing numbers, and preparing a \"Minute to ELT\" \u2013 underscores the absence of Indigenous involvement in the program's planning, design, or validation. The \"good pick-up\" by internal staff on \"strange\" comparison numbers for 2018 vs. 2019, and the subsequent internal fix, suggests a technocratic approach devoid of community co-design. This top-down methodology means the program, despite its stated aims, is not genuinely community-led.\n\nThe very statistics presented reveal a stark picture of democratic inequality: as of June 2019, the national Indigenous enrolment rate stood at a mere 76%, compared to 97% for non-Indigenous Australians, with 123,601 Indigenous individuals still \"missing\" from the roll. While the AEC attempts to address this gap, the methods employed, particularly the reliance on sensitive Centrelink data (as implied by the document's reference to \"ARIR-Centrelink\"), continue to raise substantial civil liberties and privacy concerns. This blurring of lines between social support and civic duties is an affront to individual autonomy and genuine equity, demonstrating that a deeper, rights-based commitment to Indigenous self-determination and community-led solutions is still sorely needed.", "model": "gemini-2.5-flash", "generated_at": "2025-06-21T23:37:55.618041", "raw_response_path": "data/llm_responses/LS7888__per_file__left_leaning__7888-037.pdf__20250621T233755.json", "output_tokens": 471, "prompt_tokens": 5541, "total_tokens": 7463, "summary_length": 2371}, "right_leaning": {"needs_summary": true, "source_hash": "426de3294e410be5d20c0f0719993acf9a150e678235185b21e4164f6bcef0d9", "text": "This internal Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) email exchange, centered on the \"Indigenous KPI,\" provides clear evidence of government overreach and the misdirection of public resources. The discussions around \"ATSI enrolment rates\" and the explicit mention of the `ARIR-Centrelink` methodology in file paths directly confirm the AEC's active pursuit of specific demographic enrolment targets, utilizing sensitive cross-agency data. This practice creates a de facto administrative identifier for Indigenous Australians, fundamentally infringing upon individual privacy and expanding the government's role beyond neutral electoral administration into social engineering.\n\nThe need to \"fix\" discrepancies because the \"comparison between 2019 and 2018 looks strange\" highlights a critical lack of precision and a reliance on potentially \"courageous assumptions\" within this highly politicized program. This iterative adjustment of figures, aimed at presenting a desired outcome, suggests that the focus is on achieving a predetermined demographic target rather than merely ensuring an accurate and universally applied electoral roll. The intensive internal review processes dedicated to these specific \"Indigenous KPI\" metrics imply significant, yet undisclosed, taxpayer expenditure on a program that veers from core electoral functions, raising serious questions about fiscal responsibility and the proper use of public funds for ideologically driven initiatives. This document underscores how the AEC's Indigenous Electoral Participation Program represents a significant departure from principles of limited government, neutral application of law, and transparent financial management.", "model": "gemini-2.5-flash", "generated_at": "2025-06-21T23:41:29.861707", "raw_response_path": "data/llm_responses/LS7888__per_file__right_leaning__7888-037.pdf__20250621T234129.json", "output_tokens": 284, "prompt_tokens": 5558, "total_tokens": 7155, "summary_length": 1690}, "government_skeptic": {"needs_summary": true, "source_hash": "426de3294e410be5d20c0f0719993acf9a150e678235185b21e4164f6bcef0d9", "text": "This document, an internal email exchange concerning Indigenous KPI figures, offers a candid glimpse into the AEC's bureaucratic processes and data integrity challenges, reinforcing a skeptic's view of a system focused on managing perception rather than transparent accountability.\n\n**Evidence of Bureaucracy and Lack of Accountability:**\n\n1.  **\"For-Official-Use-Only\" Tag:** The persistent classification of internal communication as \"For-Official-Use-Only\" immediately signals a culture of restricted information, limiting transparency even before data is officially released.\n2.  **Internal Data Integrity Issues:** The core of the exchange reveals a \"problem\" with the data, acknowledged by multiple staff. Angelo Rojas explicitly states, \"I always assumed that the Federal Enrolment and Enrolment Eligible Population for June 2019 was already been updated,\" highlighting a fundamental flaw in data management and a reliance on faulty assumptions, not robust, audited processes. Tita Tabije further confirms, \"we just noticed that the comparison between 2019 and 2018 looks strange and we just fixed this,\" admitting that critical discrepancies were only caught late in the reporting cycle.\n3.  **Reactive Data Correction:** The series of emails clearly shows a scramble to \"review,\" \"fix,\" and \"revise\" numbers just before a \"Minute to ELT\" (Executive Leadership Team) is prepared. This suggests a reactive approach to data validation, where the primary objective is to present \"happy\" or \"final\" numbers to senior management rather than ensuring consistent data accuracy from the outset. The initial \"happiness\" with the figures by Angelo and Tita is quickly undercut by the later discovery of problems, questioning the thoroughness of their initial review.\n4.  **Meaningless Checks:** Tita's curious note, \"any change in this file will have no effect on the results below,\" regarding the \"Informality modelling.xlsb\" file, raises suspicions of bureaucratic box-ticking rather than genuine impact assessment, potentially obscuring how various data sources truly influence the final reported KPIs.\n\n**Hidden Agendas and Perception Management:**\n\n1.  **Contradictory Data vs. Stated Outcome:** The most damning evidence lies in the document's own data table. While the FOI overview suggests the \"new methodology\" (linked to the \"ARIR-Centrelink\" file path) \"conveniently presented a dramatically improved Indigenous enrolment rate,\" this document's detailed figures tell a different story. The \"Differences between 30 June 2019 and 30 June 2018\" table clearly shows a **national decrease of 0.4%** in the Indigenous enrolment rate and a **national increase of 5,020** in the estimated \"missing\" Indigenous voters.\n2.  **Spin Over Substance:** This glaring contradiction between the AEC's apparent internal claim of \"improvement\" (as inferred by the FOI overview's context) and the actual negative trends visible in the detailed data strongly implies that the \"new methodology\" and the subsequent \"fixes\" were primarily aimed at managing the *perception* of progress. The focus on making \"Gus happy with the numbers\" and rushing to \"fix\" them before ELT reporting suggests an internal pressure to present a favorable, albeit potentially misleading, narrative, rather than transparently reporting the challenging reality of Indigenous enrolment. This aligns perfectly with the FOI overview's concern about \"questionable data manipulation\" and obscuring true costs and outcomes in favor of managing public perception.", "model":

Commission (AEC) staff (Angelo Rojas, Guy Lewis, Warrick Poyser, Michael Roden, Stephanie Maxwell, Delyse Paliaga, Gina Dario) concerning data analysis for Indigenous electoral enrolment.\n\n**Summary of Document Content:**\n\n*   **Centrelink Data Utilisation:** The document prominently features the AEC's use of Centrelink data to identify potentially unenrolled Indigenous Australians. Specifically, an email from Guy Lewis (March 2018) details an age breakdown of \"107,607 Indigenous people that are only on the Centrelink file,\" noting that 30.7% (33,008) are in the 18-24 age group.\n*   **Data Refinement and Eligibility:** Discussions include the need to cross-reference this Centrelink data with other sources (e.g., Births, Deaths, and Marriages (BDM) data, deceased persons files, and deleted records) to establish eligibility and remove those who are deceased or previously enrolled, prior to any direct enrolment efforts.\n*   **Enrolment Stimulation and Outreach Analysis:** An email from Angelo Rojas (June 2018) discusses analysis linking new Indigenous enrolments to the proportion of Email/SMS messages provided by state, especially for the 18-39 age group. It identifies lower Email/SMS provision and new enrolments in NT, WA, and SA, hypothesising lower outreach efforts or higher disengagement in these states.\n\n**Relevance to FOI Request LS7888:**\n\nThis document is highly relevant to FOI request LS7888 as it provides direct insight into the **planning and implementation** of the AEC's new methodology for its Indigenous Electoral Participation Program (IEPP) during the 2018-2019 period.\n\n*   **New Methodology:** It explicitly details the AEC's reliance on self-identified Indigeneity data from Centrelink as a core component of the \"more direct method for estimating Indigenous electoral enrolment rates\" and identifying potential unenrolled voters, which was a key aspect of the new methodology. The 107,607 figure directly relates to the efforts to identify \"over 72,000 potentially unenrolled Indigenous Australians\" mentioned in the FOI overview (this document provides a specific number used in early stages).\n*   **Planning and Implementation:** The discussions about data refinement (BDM, deceased persons) illustrate the intricate planning and technical implementation steps involved in validating and utilising this new Centrelink-derived dataset.\n*   **Outcomes and Enrolment Stimulation:** The analysis concerning Email/SMS outreach and its correlation with new enrolments demonstrates the AEC's efforts to track and refine its strategies for \"enrolment stimulation,\" and identify areas of lower engagement, directly addressing another aspect of the FOI request.\n\nThe document does *not* explicitly detail the number of Indigenous people involved in the methodology's development, its final costs, or dedicated AEC staffing, which were identified as gaps in the overall FOI release.", "model": "gemini-2.5-flash", "generated_at": "2025-06-22T00:00:46.104988", "source_hash": "01ebf55c33988393cb00e508617dcf70106e93bddc65969690019cb562025b2b", "raw_response_path": "data/llm_responses/LS7888__per_file__balanced__7888-04.pdf__20250622T000046.json", "output_tokens": 655, "prompt_tokens": 2223, "total_tokens": 3781, "summary_length": 3010}, "left_leaning": {"needs_summary": true, "source_hash": "c2f33b018ce11883bde0d4800d04f80c207602c24a3824e25fd7c8f5f2462c5b", "text": "This document, a series of internal AEC emails from early 2018, starkly illuminates the core tensions of the Indigenous Electoral Participation Program (IEPP) from a left-leaning perspective. It explicitly details the AEC's extensive reliance on sensitive Centrelink data, revealing the identification of 107,607 \"Indigenous people that are only on the Centrelink file\" \u2013 meaning not yet on the electoral roll \u2013 with a substantial proportion (30.7%) being young people aged 18-24. This direct evidence reinforces significant civil liberties and privacy concerns, highlighting the blurring of lines between social support and civic duties that can erode trust and deter Indigenous individuals from accessing vital social services if they fear automatic data sharing without their explicit consent.\n\nThe discussions within the document illustrate an internal, data-driven approach to addressing Indigenous electoral disparity, focusing on technical solutions like analyzing Email/SMS provision rates and leveraging Births, Deaths, and Marriages (BDM) data to establish eligibility. While acknowledging lower enrolment response rates and \"higher level of disengagement\" among young Indigenous people in regions like NT, WA, and SA, the proposed solutions remain bureaucratic and devoid of community consultation. Crucially, the document contains no evidence of Indigenous involvement in the planning or design of these data-matching and outreach strategies, underscoring a fundamental failing in principles of self-determination and co-design within the program. Despite the stated aim of boosting participation, this document reveals a top-down methodology that prioritizes technical data solutions over genuine, community-led engagement, ultimately undermining the pursuit of genuine social equity and democratic accountability for Indigenous Australians.", "model": "gemini-2.5-flash", "generated_at": "2025-06-21T23:38:08.705066", "raw_response_path": "data/llm_responses/LS7888__per_file__left_leaning__7888-04.pdf__20250621T233808.json", "output_tokens": 334, "prompt_tokens": 2197, "total_tokens": 4161, "summary_length": 1854}, "right_leaning": {"needs_summary": true, "source_hash": "c2f33b018ce11883bde0d4800d04f80c207602c24a3824e25fd7c8f5f2462c5b", "text": "This document, detailing internal Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) discussions, confirms the agency's reliance on sensitive cross-agency data, specifically Centrelink's Indigenous identifier, to pinpoint and target Indigenous Australians for enrolment. The explicit mention of 107,607 \"Indigenous people that are only on the Centrelink file\" reveals a de facto administrative identifier, allowing the government to actively track and categorize citizens based on self-declared ethnicity across different departmental databases. This constitutes a profound infringement on individual privacy and an unwarranted expansion of government reach beyond its traditional electoral function into areas bordering on social engineering.\n\nFurthermore, the document indicates an intention to integrate Births, Deaths, and Marriages (BDM) data to \"establish eligibility prior to being able to do any meaningful direct enrolment effort,\" signifying an ever-widening net of data matching that erodes the individual's right to digital anonymity and autonomous engagement with electoral processes. The AEC's detailed analysis of \"new enrolments for Indigenous not on the roll\" and \"enrolment response rates\" for specific age groups and states underscores a targeted approach to electoral participation, deviating from the principle of neutral, universal enrolment and instead prioritizing specific demographic outcomes, which raises concerns about the impartial application of electoral law.

The initial email from Guy Lewis explicitly details a core dataset of \"107,607 Indigenous people that are only on the Centrelink file,\" which forms the basis of the AEC's \"new methodology.\" Crucially, Lewis simultaneously admits this data requires an immediate \"rerunning... against the deceased persons file and deleted records\" by \"Mike,\" and Warrick Poyser highlights the need for \"additional/special\" work with BDM data to establish eligibility *before* any \"meaningful direct enrolment effort.\" This directly supports the FOI request's assertion of \"questionable data manipulation\" and \"internal data integrity issues,\" demonstrating the AEC was leveraging a raw, unverified, and likely inflated number as its starting point.\n\nThe subsequent email from Angelo Rojas, dated months later, reveals an ongoing internal struggle with basic data correlation and hypothesis testing (e.g., about Email/SMS effectiveness), still awaiting a crucial \"extract\" from \"Mike.\" This highlights a slow, internally-focused bureaucratic process that prioritizes theoretical data analysis and prediction over demonstrable, efficient outreach. The cryptic and incomplete table in Rojas's email further exemplifies poor internal data presentation or a lack of clear, actionable metrics. Combined with the numerous redaction codes, particularly for \"deliberative material\" and \"proper and efficient conduct of the operations of AEC material,\" the document suggests a concerted effort to manage perceptions and obscure the true operational challenges, inefficiencies, and lack of readiness underlying the program.", "model": "gemini-2.5-flash", "generated_at": "2025-06-21T23:46:21.770550", "raw_response_path": "data/llm_responses/LS7888__per_file__government_skeptic__7888-04.pdf__20250621T234621.json", "output_tokens": 346, "prompt_tokens": 2195, "total_tokens": 4533, "summary_length": 1841}, "government_apologist": {"needs_summary": true, "source_hash": "c2f33b018ce11883bde0d4800d04f80c207602c24a3824e25fd7c8f5f2462c5b"}, "highly_critical": {"needs_summary": true, "source_hash": "c2f33b018ce11883bde0d4800d04f80c207602c24a3824e25fd7c8f5f2462c5b"}}, "filename": "7888-04.pdf", "download_path": "/foi_assets/LS7888/7888-04.pdf", "extracted_text": "\n\n--- Page 1 ---\n\nFrom: Angelo Rojas <Angelo.Rojas@aec.gov.au>  \nSent: Monday, 4 June 2018 3:45 PM \nTo: Guy Lewis <Guy.Lewis@aec.gov.au> \nCc: Stephanie Maxwell <Stephanie.Maxwell@aec.gov.au> \nSubject: FW: Indigenous data [SEC=UNCLASSIFIED] \n\nGuy - as discussed, the number of new enrolments for Indigenous not on the roll could be predicted to a fair extent by the proportion of Email/SMSs \nprovided by State.

The correspondence discusses the estimated Indigenous electoral enrolment rates for 2019, comparing them to previous years (2017-2018) and anticipating questions from stakeholders.\n\n### Key Points:\n\n*   **National Enrolment Trends (2017-2019):**\n    *   The national Indigenous enrolment rate saw a small increase from 76.4% in 2018 to 76.6% in 2019, continuing an upward trend from 74.7% in 2017.\n    *   The estimated Indigenous eligible enrolment population (EEP) grew by 2.7% (13,360 people), while the estimated number of Indigenous people enrolled grew by 3% (11,455 people).\n    *   The estimated unenrolled Indigenous population nationally increased by 1.6% (from 118,581 to 120,486), which was noted as \"unfavourable\" compared to the 4% decrease observed between 2017 and 2018.\n*   **State-Specific Analysis:**\n    *   **New South Wales (NSW):** Experienced a slight decrease in its estimated Indigenous enrolment rate from 87.3% (2018) to 86.2% (2019). Despite this, the rate was still up from 85.9% in 2017. Critically, the estimated unenrolled NSW Indigenous population grew by 10.9% (from 20,954 to 23,239), which was identified as an \"outlier.\"\n    *   **Northern Territory (NT) & Western Australia (WA):** Both showed small increases in their enrolment rates and decreases or minor changes in their estimated unenrolled Indigenous populations, continuing upward trends.\n    *   **Queensland (Qld):** Also recorded a small increase in its enrolment rate, continuing an upward trend from 70% in 2017.\n*   **Explanation for NSW Outlier:** Angelo Rojas provided a statistical explanation for the 10.9% increase in unenrolled Indigenous in NSW. He clarified that a 1 percentage point decrease in the enrolment rate (from 87% to 86%) was not statistically significant and fell within estimation error. The seemingly large percentage increase in unenrolled numbers was attributed to NSW having the largest estimated eligible Indigenous population and a high enrolment rate, meaning a small percentage drop affects a relatively smaller base of unenrolled people, thus making the percentage increase of the unenrolled appear higher compared to states with larger unenrolled populations.\n\n### Relevance to FOI Request LS7888:\n\nThis document is highly relevant to FOI request LS7888 as it directly addresses the \"outcomes\" and \"impact\" aspects of the AEC's new methodology for its Indigenous Electoral Participation Program (IEPP).\n\n*   **Outcomes:** It provides specific figures for estimated Indigenous enrolment rates for 2019 (national 76.6%), confirming the shift and significant increase in estimated rates compared to the old methodology's 58% and the 2018 rate of 76.4% mentioned in the FOI overview.\n*   **Impact:** The detailed national and state-level breakdowns of enrolled and unenrolled Indigenous populations demonstrate the impact of the new methodology in tracking electoral participation and identifying areas of focus (like the NSW outlier). The discussion about the growth of the unenrolled population, nationally and in specific states, directly relates to efforts to track enrolment stimulation.\n*   **Planning/Implementation (indirect):** While not detailing the *development* of the methodology, the email exchange itself reflects the internal AEC processes for discussing, analysing, and preparing to report on the *results* derived from the new methodology, indicating ongoing implementation and monitoring.\n*   **Missing Information:** Consistent with the FOI overview, this document does not provide explicit details on the number of Indigenous people involved in the methodology's development, its final costs, or dedicated AEC staffing for the program.", "model": "gemini-2.5-flash", "generated_at": "2025-06-22T00:01:01.000335", "source_hash": "1dab8f6ede24d0cc34e7f1e31b2062710a0216c90a9b934f277b272685aed049", "raw_response_path": "data/llm_responses/LS7888__per_file__balanced__7888-040.pdf__20250622T000100.json", "output_tokens": 946, "prompt_tokens": 4354, "total_tokens": 6919, "summary_length": 4020}, "left_leaning": {"needs_summary": true, "source_hash": "66610af1c85b78a705b695c5e7a590e6051e6808d3ca7a57130da6e38ad17074", "text": "This document underscores the persistent, fundamental challenge of Indigenous electoral enrolment, directly impacting democratic accountability and social equity. While the AEC aims to \"Close the Gap,\" the internal 2019 data presents a concerning picture: a mere 0.2 percentage point national increase in Indigenous enrolment is overshadowed by a critical **rise in the absolute number of estimated unenrolled Indigenous people nationally, from 118,581 to 120,486**. This signifies a failure to genuinely expand participation, leaving a significant cohort of Indigenous Australians disenfranchised and undermining their democratic voice.\n\nThe email's explicit acknowledgement of \"estimated\" rates and \"estimation error\" directly reinforces the broader FOI overview's critique regarding the **continued absence of a direct Indigenous identifier on the federal roll**. This reliance on imprecise, \"indicative only\" data perpetuates a systemic barrier, hindering accurate measurement and targeted interventions crucial for achieving true electoral equity.\n\nMoreover, the internal nature of this discussion, with AEC staff focused on preparing \"speaking notes\" and \"QTB\" (Question Time Briefs) to *answer* anticipated questions about concerning trends like the 10.9% increase in unenrolled Indigenous people in NSW, highlights the **absence of Indigenous involvement in the program's planning or design**. This top-down, reactive approach prioritises managing external perceptions over fostering genuine, community-led solutions, starkly deviating from principles of self-determination and co-design. The persistent unenrolment, despite AEC efforts, demonstrates that deep-seated structural issues and a lack of genuine, community-driven engagement continue to impede true democratic participation for Indigenous Australians.", "model": "gemini-2.5-flash", "generated_at": "2025-06-21T23:38:20.163596", "raw_response_path": "data/llm_responses/LS7888__per_file__left_leaning__7888-040.pdf__20250621T233820.json", "output_tokens": 337, "prompt_tokens": 4289, "total_tokens": 6054, "summary_length": 1821}, "right_leaning": {"needs_summary": true, "source_hash": "66610af1c85b78a705b695c5e7a590e6051e6808d3ca7a57130da6e38ad17074", "text": "This document, detailing the Australian Electoral Commission's internal assessment of Indigenous enrolment rates, significantly reinforces concerns about government overreach, fiscal responsibility, and the efficacy of targeted programs. Despite the AEC's Indigenous Electoral Participation Program, the estimated unenrolled Indigenous population *increased* nationally and in New South Wales by a concerning 10.9%. This upward trend in unenrolment, after substantial investments and the implementation of a new methodology, directly questions the program's effectiveness and represents a potential waste of taxpayer funds.\n\nThe internal anxiety evident in the emails, with staff needing to \"be prepared to answer the question about NSW,\" highlights a bureaucratic preoccupation with explaining away unfavourable outcomes rather than addressing fundamental program inefficiencies. This focus on managing public perception of specific demographic enrolment rates, rather than a neutral, cost-effective administration of the electoral roll for all citizens, underscores a drift towards social engineering and an expansion of government reach beyond its core function. The complex explanations for seemingly minor percentage shifts translating into large absolute increases in unenrolled individuals further expose the \"courageous assumptions\" and fluctuating outcomes that undermine faith in the program's precision and accountability.", "model": "gemini-2.5-flash", "generated_at": "2025-06-21T23:41:51.186513", "raw_response_path": "data/llm_responses/LS7888__per_file__right_leaning__7888-040.pdf__20250621T234151.json", "output_tokens": 230, "prompt_tokens": 4306, "total_tokens": 5807, "summary_length": 1433}, "government_skeptic": {"needs_summary": true, "source_hash": "66610af1c85b78a705b695c5e7a590e6051e6808d3ca7a57130da6e38ad17074", "text": "This internal AEC email chain exemplifies a bureaucratic focus on managing perception and obscuring true costs rather than achieving substantive outcomes. It reveals staff actively \"preparing the paper work (Minute, speaking notes, QTB, draft letters etc.)\" *before* releasing Indigenous enrolment data, indicating a pre-emptive effort to control the public narrative rather than offering transparent, unfiltered information. When confronted with a significant 10.9% increase in the estimated unenrolled Indigenous population in NSW (an absolute rise of 2,285 people), the agency immediately attempts to downplay it as \"not statistically significant\" and within \"estimation error,\" employing convoluted statistical explanations to normalize this \"apparent big increase.\" A senior staff member's explicit concern about being \"prepared to answer the question about NSW\" highlights a focus on managing external scrutiny and developing pre-packaged responses, rather than a genuine internal drive to understand and address the underlying reasons for increasing unenrolment. The internal acknowledgement of \"unfavourable\" increases in national and NSW unenrolled Indigenous populations, coupled with the documented efforts to statistically rationalize negative trends, suggests a bureaucratic exercise primarily aimed at containing public relations challenges rather than fostering genuine accountability for improving Indigenous electoral participation.", "model":

enrolment figures and trends for the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC), particularly in the lead-up to Supplementary Budget Estimates. It highlights record national enrolment rates of 97.0% for the 2019 federal election and a youth enrolment rate of 88.8%.\n\nCrucially, the brief details Indigenous enrolment rates, stating that the AEC commenced publication of these estimates by state and territory as of 30 June 2018. It explicitly contrasts the national estimated Indigenous enrolment rate of 76.6% (as at 30 June 2019, and 76.4% in 2018) with a \"previous national Indigenous enrolment estimate of 58 per cent calculated in 2014 using a different methodology.\" The document also notes the AEC's ongoing efforts to ensure full electoral participation for all eligible Australians, including targeted activities and partnerships in remote communities, and mentions an enrolment stimulation exercise targeting 410,000 unenrolled people before the 2019 election.\n\n### Relevance to FOI Request LS7888\n\nThis document is highly relevant to FOI request LS7888, which sought information on the AEC's new methodology for its Indigenous Electoral Participation Program (IEPP) from 2018-2019.\n\n1.  **New Methodology & Outcomes:** The document directly addresses the shift in methodology by clearly stating the AEC began publishing new Indigenous enrolment rates from June 2018 and contrasting them with the 2014 estimate based on a \"different methodology.\" It provides the exact \"outcomes\" requested by the FOI, confirming the new estimated Indigenous enrolment rates of 76.4% (June 2018) and 76.6% (June 2019), which directly reflect the impact of the new approach (as described in the FOI overview, likely due to Centrelink data).\n2.  **Timeframe:** The document falls squarely within the 2018-2019 timeframe of the FOI request, providing data points from this period.\n3.  **Implementation (Implicit):** While not detailing the planning or explicit implementation steps of the new methodology's *development*, it confirms its *application* by stating when the new estimates began to be published.\n4.  **Missing Information:** Consistent with the FOI overview, this document does not provide specific details on the number of Indigenous people involved in the methodology's development, its final costs, or dedicated AEC staffing, thus aligning with the gaps identified in the released content for LS7888.", "model": "gemini-2.5-flash", "generated_at": "2025-06-22T00:01:11.529408", "source_hash": "88be450ed7e0ab858dd6f318bee572020cbb75577d7e79717a18f13e0c63d10d", "raw_response_path": "data/llm_responses/LS7888__per_file__balanced__7888-041.pdf__20250622T000111.json", "output_tokens": 582, "prompt_tokens": 2763, "total_tokens": 4655, "summary_length": 2514}, "left_leaning": {"needs_summary": true, "source_hash": "fec6ceacdfc644d7bd0a5b197f3a322fff5b4f2302a88b22443de463c2ebab18", "text": "This document, an Estimates Brief from October 2019, starkly highlights a persistent democratic deficit for Indigenous Australians within the context of the Australian Electoral Commission's (AEC) Indigenous Electoral Participation Program (IEPP). While the AEC commends itself on a record high national enrolment rate of 97.0% for the 2019 federal election, the reported Indigenous enrolment rate stands significantly lower at 76.6%, a figure the document admits \"remained steady\" and labels any gap \"concerning.\"\n\nFrom a left-leaning perspective, the term \"steady\" for a 76.6% enrolment rate, when the national rate is 97.0%, is not a sign of progress but rather a stark indictment of the ongoing inequities in electoral participation. This substantial 20.4 percentage point gap underscores a fundamental failure to achieve genuine social equity in Australia's democratic process.\n\nFurthermore, the document's reliance on an \"estimated Indigenous enrolment rate\" subtly reinforces the critical progressive shortcoming identified in the FOI overview: the continued absence of a direct Indigenous identifier on the federal roll. This systemic lack of accurate, self-identified data impedes genuine democratic accountability, as it prevents a precise understanding of the enrolment landscape and the effectiveness of targeted interventions. Without direct identification, efforts to \"Close the Gap\" remain based on \"indicative only\" data, obscuring the true extent of disengagement or barriers.\n\nWhile the document notes the AEC is \"investing in partnerships and targeted activities that extend its reach into remote communities\" and that \"Remote Area Mobile Polling remains an important component,\" it provides no evidence of Indigenous involvement in the planning or design of these initiatives. This omission, when viewed through the lens of the broader FOI overview, confirms a significant deviation from principles of self-determination and co-design. Such top-down approaches, even if well-intentioned, inherently limit their potential for genuine social equity, as they fail to empower Indigenous communities to shape the solutions that best serve their unique needs. The persistence of the enrolment gap, despite these stated efforts, underscores the urgent need for a deeper commitment to community-led solutions and genuine partnership to address this critical democratic shortfall.", "model": "gemini-2.5-flash", "generated_at": "2025-06-21T23:38:31.136467", "raw_response_path": "data/llm_responses/LS7888__per_file__left_leaning__7888-041.pdf__20250621T233831.json", "output_tokens": 454, "prompt_tokens": 2703, "total_tokens": 4317, "summary_length": 2391}, "right_leaning": {"needs_summary": true, "source_hash": "fec6ceacdfc644d7bd0a5b197f3a322fff5b4f2302a88b22443de463c2ebab18", "text": "This \"Estimates Brief\" document, prepared for Supplementary Budget Estimates in October 2019, highlights a seemingly positive overall enrolment rate of 97.0 per cent for the 2019 federal election. However, when viewed through a right-leaning lens within the context of the broader FOI request, it substantiates significant concerns about government overreach and a departure from fiscal accountability.\n\nThe document's explicit focus on the \"Indigenous enrolment rate\" and the AEC's stated concern that \"Any gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous enrolment rates is concerning\" confirms a targeted, rather than neutral, approach to electoral participation. This proactive stance, described as \"investing in partnerships and targeted activities,\" aligns precisely with the FOI request's critique of the AEC's shift towards social engineering, actively pursuing specific demographic enrolment rates under a \"Closing the Gap\" mandate instead of applying electoral law neutrally. Such targeted interventions infringe on individual liberty by creating a de facto government-driven participation quota for specific groups, rather than simply facilitating universal access.\n\nFurthermore, the document's admission of an \"enrolment stimulation exercise\" targeting 410,000 people directly corroborates the FOI request's concerns regarding the undisclosed costs and a severe lack of financial transparency for these \"enrolment stimulation events.\" This signifies questionable fiscal responsibility, as taxpayer funds are allocated to active campaigning for specific demographic enrolment rather than core, neutral electoral functions. The mention of a \"different methodology\" for calculating Indigenous enrolment rates also subtly reinforces the broader FOI concern about \"courageous assumptions\" and potential data matching, raising further questions about accuracy and privacy implications. Overall, this document reveals an AEC moving beyond its essential role into an active, interventionist agency, which undermines market freedom by distorting the organic participation of citizens and expanding government's reach into areas of individual choice.", "model": "gemini-2.5-flash", "generated_at": "2025-06-21T23:42:04.849165", "raw_response_path": "data/llm_responses/LS7888__per_file__right_leaning__7888-041.pdf__20250621T234204.json", "output_tokens": 385, "prompt_tokens": 2720, "total_tokens": 4731, "summary_length": 2145}, "government_skeptic": {"needs_summary": true, "source_hash": "fec6ceacdfc644d7bd0a5b197f3a322fff5b4f2302a88b22443de463c2ebab18", "text": "This \"Estimates Brief\" serves as a prime example of bureaucratic spin, deliberately designed to present a positive, controlled narrative rather than transparently addressing core issues. While ostensibly providing \"current enrolment figures, trends,\" it conspicuously confirms the use of a \"different methodology\" for Indigenous enrolment, which conveniently resulted in a dramatically higher estimated rate (76.6% in 2018-19, up from 58% in 2014) without offering any explanation or justification for this significant shift. From a skeptic's viewpoint, this omission aligns perfectly with the FOI overview's assertion of \"questionable data manipulation\" and the leveraging of a \"new methodology\" to manage perception, rather than reflecting genuine improvements.\n\nThe document states the Indigenous enrolment rate \"remained steady\" at 76.6% for 2018-19, implicitly admitting that despite the AEC \"investing in partnerships and targeted activities,\" there was no further measurable improvement in that period. This highlights an apparent inefficiency, where significant resources are vaguely committed (no cost or staffing details are provided, reinforcing the \"deliberately withheld crucial planning, cost, and staffing details\" claim from the FOI overview) without yielding tangible, ongoing enrolment growth. The brief's vague assurance that the AEC \"is working to ensure the full electoral participation\" through unspecified \"partnerships and targeted activities\" reads as a generic bureaucratic statement, lacking the specific performance metrics or accountability measures one would expect if genuine outcomes were the primary focus.

It describes a shift from an earlier (2014) indirect regression model, which yielded \"alarmingly low\" and less reliable estimates, to a more direct approach leveraging Centrelink's self-identified Indigenous status data.\n\nBeginning in 2017, the AEC integrated Centrelink's Indigenous indicator into its Annual Roll Integrity Review (ARIR) through person-level matching, providing explicit Indigenous status for over 6 million enrolled persons. The new methodology involves:\n1.  Calculating the raw enrolment rate for identified Indigenous and non-Indigenous Centrelink clients.\n2.  Determining an adjustment factor by comparing the overall AEC enrolment rate with the Centrelink-based rate.\n3.  Applying this factor to derive adjusted Indigenous and non-Indigenous enrolment rates.\n\nWhile acknowledging that the results are indicative and rely on certain assumptions, the document concludes that this method provides a \"higher likelihood of robust results.\" It presents indicative national non-enrolment figures for 30 June 2017, showing a 29% non-enrolment rate for Indigenous Australians (implying a 71% enrolment rate) compared to 3% for non-Indigenous Australians. The development of this method is attributed to the AEC's Research Section, with acknowledgment to the former Electoral Integrity Unit and the IT Branch.\n\n**Relevance to FOI Request LS7888:**\n\nThis document is highly relevant to FOI request LS7888, which sought information on the AEC's new methodology for its Indigenous Electoral Participation Program (IEPP) from 2018-2019.\n\n*   **New Methodology:** The document directly addresses the core of the FOI request by detailing the *new methodology* for estimating Indigenous electoral enrolment using Centrelink data, replacing the previous 2014 model. This shift from an indirect, less accurate method to a more direct, data-driven approach is a central theme of the request.\n*   **Planning & Implementation:** It outlines the genesis of this shift, from an \"informal proposal\" by the Research Section to its \"fruition in 2017\" and integration into the ARIR, indicating the planning and initial implementation phases within the requested timeframe.\n*   **Outcomes:** The document provides initial *outcomes* of this new methodology, presenting estimated Indigenous non-enrolment rates for 2017 that are significantly higher (indicating lower non-enrolment) than those implied by the previous methodology's \"alarmingly low\" figures mentioned in the FOI overview (e.g., 71% enrolment vs. ~58%). This demonstrates the immediate impact of the methodological change on reported rates.\n*   **Indigenous Involvement:** The document does *not* explicitly detail the number of Indigenous people involved in the methodology's development, which was a specific aspect of the FOI request that the released content did not fully address.\n*   **Costs/Staffing:** Similarly, the document does *not* explicitly detail the final costs or dedicated AEC staffing associated with the development or ongoing use of this methodology. It only mentions the AEC sections involved.\n*   **Timeline:** Dated May 2018 and presenting 2017 data, the document falls squarely within the 2018-2019 period of the FOI request, providing insight into the foundational work and early results of the new methodology.", "model": "gemini-2.5-flash", "generated_at": "2025-06-22T00:01:27.902031", "source_hash": "0e620f397f788463744766bab21a8d6b79f5b3c28219236e438bb2e732f14c63", "raw_response_path": "data/llm_responses/LS7888__per_file__balanced__7888-06.pdf__20250622T000127.json", "output_tokens": 809, "prompt_tokens": 1911, "total_tokens": 4152, "summary_length": 3780}, "left_leaning": {"needs_summary": true, "source_hash": "0c307163cd3c4b980a91d19b05d7c5b604891aa6b76bbd99bc9ee86e96897afd", "text": "This document details the Australian Electoral Commission's (AEC) struggle to accurately measure Indigenous electoral participation due to the **critical systemic absence of a direct Indigenous identifier on the federal roll**. From a left-leaning perspective, this highlights a fundamental failing in democratic accountability, as it necessitates reliance on indirect and potentially flawed methods, underscoring the lack of a system that genuinely recognizes and enables Indigenous self-determination in civic participation.\n\nThe document reveals the AEC's **extensive reliance on Centrelink data**, including its \"Indigenous indicator,\" to estimate enrolment and turnout rates. This raises significant **civil liberties concerns** regarding privacy and the blurring of lines between social welfare services and civic duties.

Having these key franchise KPIs for the \n\nIndigenous population is important for Closing the Gap purposes and the AECs focus on how the franchise \ncould be better delivered. \n\nIn 2014 the AEC\u2019s Research Section commenced indirect estimation of these figures, using a regression model \nof the relationship between the Indigenous population and each of the three franchise KPIs at a small area \nlevel, such as polling place catchment or the ABS\u2019 SA2 geography. While the models did not fit the data \nparticularly well, the resulting Indigenous enrolment, \nreal data, rather than anecdote. Yet the resulting enrolment and turnout rates in particular were alarmingly \nlow, and hopefully represented a worst case picture. \n\n rates were statistically based on \n\nCentrelink Data \nAround the same time, the Research Section informally proposed that person-level Centrelink extracts that the \nAEC received occasionally for other Roll validation work, could perhaps be extended to include Centrelink\u2019s \nIndigenous indicator. This came to fruition in 20171. \n\nAs part of the Annual Roll Integrity Review (ARIR), the person-level matching between the Roll and Centrelink \nnow included Centrelink\u2019s Indigenous indicator. However as Centrelink customers represent only around half \nof the Roll, the matching (even if perfect) would be far from assigning all enrolments an Indigenous flag. \nNevertheless, for the first time the AEC has a very large number of enrolled persons, over 6 million, with an \nexplicit Indigenous status. \n\nEnrolment Rate\n\n1.\nThe enrolment rate, even for all persons regardless of indigenaity, is difficult to calculate reliably due to \nconceptual, collection and methodological differences between the Roll (numerator) and the ABS-based \nenrolment-eligible population (denominator, \u201cEEP\u201d). In the case of the Indigenous population these problems \nare magnified by having no Indigenous identifier on the Roll and less reliable estimates of Indigenous EEP.  \n\nHowever, matching the Roll to Centrelink data allows a more direct method of estimating the Indigenous \nenrolment rate. It is still subject to quite courageous assumptions, but as fewer are required it likely \nrepresents an improved approach.

This is the raw enrolment rate of Centrelink clients.\nCalculate the ratio of the actual AEC enrolment rate versus the Centrelink-based rate, for the same\npoint in time. This is the overall factor to adjust any Centrelink-based rates to align with AEC\nenrolment rates.\nApply the adjustment factor to raw Centrelink-based enrolment rates by Indigenous status to give\nIndigenous and non-Indigenous enrolment rates.\nThis process can be done at the State level, though results will have lower reliability.\n\nNOTE: While this method avoids indirectly modelling Indigenous enrolment rates via geographic \nassociation, it does assume that any bias in Centrelink clients being enrolled is equal for \nIndigenous and non-Indigenous, and that there are no substantive Indigenous-status biases \ninherent in the Roll-to-Centrelink person matching. \n\n1 Acknowledge with appreciation the work of the former Electoral Integrity Unit and the IT Branch. \n\n1919LS7888 Released Document No. 6Released under the Freedom of Information Act 1982\n\n\n--- Page 2 ---\n\nConclusion and Results \nThe Centrelink client file with Indigenous indicator newly available to the AEC has presented an excellent \nopportunity, via matching to the Roll \n\n, to improve estimation of Indigenous franchise KPIs.  \n\nWhile the results are subject to a number of non-trivial assumptions, the more direct estimation methods lead \nto a higher likelihood of robust results.
